Bench Presses</h3><p>These workouts to maintain muscle tone in your 40s kick off with a focus on upper-body strength. The bench press is a fundamental exercise for developing upper-body strength, targeting the pectoral muscles, shoulders, and triceps.</p><p>To perform a bench press, lie flat on your back on a bench with your feet flat on the floor. Grip the barbell wider than shoulder-width apart. Your forearms should be vertical when the barbell is in the bottom position. Lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body. Push evenly through both hands to return the barbell to the starting position without locking out your elbows. Perform three sets of eight to 12 repetitions.</p><h3>2. Barbell Rows</h3><p>The barbell row is a compound exercise that targets the back muscles, biceps, and shoulders.</p><p>To perform a barbell row, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and bend at the hips until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Your knees should be slightly bent. Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Pull the barbell to your torso, keeping your elbows close to your body and avoiding shrugging your shoulders. Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Perform three sets of eight to 12 repetitions.</p><h3>3. Shoulder Presses</h3><p>Shoulder presses primarily work the deltoids and triceps. As you perform each repetition, emphasize on not shrugging throughout the range of motion.</p><p>To perform a shoulder press, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level. Extend your arms to push the dumbbells upward until they touch above your head. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. Perform three sets of eight to 12 repetitions.</p><h3>4. Pull-ups</h3><p>Pull-ups work the lats, rhomboids, and biceps. As you pull up, imagine you're crushing a piece of fruit in your armpit.</p><p>To perform a pull-up, grip the pull-up bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
