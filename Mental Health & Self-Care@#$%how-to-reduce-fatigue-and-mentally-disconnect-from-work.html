    <main><h1>How to reduce fatigue and mentally disconnect from work</h1><p>In today’s always-on, hyper-connected world, mentally disconnecting from work has become a rare and valuable skill. With the boundaries between work and personal life increasingly blurred, it’s harder than ever to switch off mentally and truly unwind.</p><p>However, as the hit TV series “Severance” explores, the ability to mentally disconnect from work is crucial for our well-being and happiness.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTALLY DISCONNECTING FROM WORK</h2><p>Mentally disconnecting from work, also known as psychological detachment, has been linked to numerous benefits. Research has shown that people who can effectively mentally disconnect from work during non-work hours experience less fatigue, better physical and mental health, and greater overall happiness.</p><p>As Jane Gifkins from Griffith University explains, “People who can do it are happier and healthier, and experience less fatigue.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO MENTALLY DISCONNECT FROM WORK: EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES</h2><p>So, how can we achieve this elusive state of mental disconnection? Gifkins and her colleagues conducted a survey of 166 nurses working in hospital emergency departments in 2020, a highly stressful work environment.</p><p>They found that three key strategies helped participants reduce fatigue and mentally recover from work: exercise, spending time with family and friends, and engaging in leisure pursuits.</p><p>Exercise, in particular, offers both physical and mental benefits. Focusing deeply on physical activity, whether it’s yoga, running, or playing a sport, can help us mentally disconnect from work and centre our attention on the present moment.</p><p>Similarly, spending quality time with loved ones and pursuing hobbies and interests can provide a much-needed mental break from work-related thoughts and concerns.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">CREATING BOUNDARIES</h2><p>In addition to engaging in activities that promote mental disconnection, it’s important to set clear boundaries between work and home. This means completing daily tasks before leaving work, unplugging from work-related technology, and avoiding checking emails or texts outside of work hours.</p><p>As Gifkins notes, “Where possible, complete all your daily tasks so these aren’t on your mind at home. Unplug from work-related technology by not checking work emails or texts.”</p><p>Of course, with the rise of remote work and technology, mentally disconnecting from work has become more challenging than ever.</p><p>However, setting healthy routines and creating physical and mental boundaries around work time can help, even when your workplace is just a few steps away.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHY MENTALLY DISCONNECTING FROM WORK MATTERS</h2><p>In a world that demands constant connectivity and productivity, the ability to mentally disconnect from work has never been more important.</p><p>By engaging in activities that promote mental disconnection, setting clear boundaries between work and home, and prioritising our well-being, we can reduce fatigue, improve our physical and mental health, and find greater happiness and fulfilment in both our personal and professional lives.</p><p>As the nurses in Gifkins’ study demonstrated, even in the most demanding and stressful work environments, it’s possible to mentally disconnect and recover from work.</p><p>By making a conscious effort to mentally disconnect and prioritise our well-being, we can thrive in a 24/7 world and find the balance we need to lead happy, healthy lives.</p></main>
