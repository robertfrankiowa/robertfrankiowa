Whether you fancy something like an easy, nutrient-rich smoothie or a savory, satisfying  grain bowl, this collection is packed with the flavorful dishes you’re looking for in a morning meal. Plus, each serving is low in sodium and saturated fats to align seamlessly with a heart-healthy eating pattern. Recipes like our high-fiber Strawberry-Peach Chia Seed Smoothie and cheesy Egg Sandwiches with Rosemary, Tomato & Feta are so delicious, you’ll want to make them again and again.</p><h2>Strawberry-Peach Chia Seed Smoothie</h2><p>This fiber-rich chia smoothie is sweet and tangy, with a velvety texture thanks to nutritious chia seeds that expand as they combine with liquid.</p><h2>Two-Ingredient Banana Pancakes</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1mgzQ9_two_ingredient_banana_pancakes.jpg" alt="Two-Ingredient Banana Pancakes"><figcaption><em>. Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><p>These delicious and unbelievably simple pancakes are best enjoyed right after cooking. With just eggs and a banana, you can have healthy grain-free pancakes with no added sugar.</p><h2>Egg Sandwiches with Rosemary, Tomato & Feta</h2><p>These hearty breakfast sandwiches are packed with ingredients popular in the Mediterranean diet, including feta, tomato and spinach.</p><h2>Anti-Inflammatory Cherry, Beet & Kale Smoothie</h2><p>Kale, cherries and beets team up in this powerful anti-inflammatory smoothie. All three of these fruits and veggies contain unique anti-inflammatory compounds that may help stave off diseases associated with chronic inflammation, including cancer, heart disease, arthritis and diabetes. Using packaged steamed beets is a great shortcut here. If you have cooked beets on hand, use those! The cherries help sweeten the smoothie and add a fruity flavor. If you opt for tart cherries, you can balance the tanginess with a small drizzle of honey or maple syrup.</p><h2>Spinach & Egg Scramble with Raspberries</h2><p>This quick egg scramble with hearty bread is one of the best breakfasts for weight loss. It combines protein-packed eggs and superfood raspberries with filling whole-grain toast and nutrient-rich spinach. The protein and fiber help fill you up and keep you going through the morning.</p><h2>Peanut Butter & Berries Waffle Sandwich</h2><p>Whole-grain freezer waffles make the perfect base for a nourishing breakfast that tastes just like a classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We use crunchy peanut butter to add texture, but you can swap in creamy, if you prefer. If fresh berries aren't available, you can use frozen ones; microwave them in a small bowl for about 30 seconds to thaw before adding to the sandwich.</p><h2>Almond Butter & Roasted Grape Toast</h2><p>A slice of almond butter toast gets topped with roasted grapes for a sweet, nutty bite. This three-ingredient twist on a classic PB & J makes for a quick and tasty breakfast or snack.</p><h2>Anti-Inflammatory Lemon-Blueberry Smoothie</h2><p>The kale, hemp seeds and green tea in this bright, lemony smoothie all contain antioxidants that can help fight inflammation. If you can’t find baby kale, baby spinach will work well in its place. Banana adds natural sweetness. If you want it a little sweeter, just a touch of honey will do the trick.</p><h2>Spinach & Fried Egg Grain Bowls</h2><p>Wheat berries, a nutty-tasting whole grain with a pleasantly chewy texture, are the base of this hearty breakfast bowl recipe. The fiber-rich grain freezes very well, so cook up a batch to stash away for salads, bowls and more. Topped with spinach, peanuts and an egg, these bowls make for a satisfying breakfast. Sprinkle with crushed red pepper for extra heat.</p><h2>Gluten-Free Almond-Flour Banana Pancakes</h2><p>These gluten-free almond-flour banana pancakes have a lovely nutty flavor that complements the sweet bananas. Vanilla and nutmeg tie everything together.</p><h2>Pistachio & Peach Toast</h2><p>This breakfast is great when you have leftover ricotta cheese--plus it comes together in just 5 minutes.</p><h2>High-Fiber Matcha Green Smoothie Bowl</h2><p>Matcha powder and spinach give this healthy smoothie bowl a beautiful green hue. If you don't have spinach on hand, try swapping in another dark leafy green like kale.</p><h2>Egg Tartine</h2><p>Bruschetta meets avocado toast in this simple breakfast upgrade.</p><h2>Scrambled Egg with Tofu</h2><p>Even when you are cooking for one, it's worth taking a few minutes to make a hot, protein-rich breakfast. By stretching an egg with a little tofu, you reduce the cholesterol and saturated fat. Try tucking it into a whole-wheat pita pocket for a simple and satisfying breakfast sandwich-and a healthful alternative to fast-food fare.</p><h2>Southwestern Breakfast Tostadas</h2><p>Mashed black beans, crumbled queso freso, fresh cilantro and chopped tomato give this easy breakast tostada a Soutwestern flair.</p><h2>Egg, Spinach & Cheddar Breakfast Sandwich</h2><p>Fill yourself up with this ultra-quick egg, spinach and Cheddar breakfast sandwich. It's not only fast, but there's a good chance you already have the ingredients on hand that you'll need to pull it together, so you can skip a trip to the store before your busy workweek.</p><h2>Cherry-Pineapple Smoothie</h2><p>Cherries contain vitamin E, vitamin C and polyphenols, nutrients that may help reduce inflammation in the body. The tart pomegranate-cherry juice pairs well with crushed pineapple and creamy yogurt.</p><h2>Rice Cakes with Peanut Butter</h2><p>Top multigrain rice cakes with creamy peanut butter for a nutritious snack with protein and fiber to keep you feeling full.</p><h2>Strawberry & Yogurt Parfait</h2><p>This strawberry parfait recipe combines fresh fruit, strained yogurt and crunchy granola for an easy breakfast. Pack the parfait in a Mason jar for a healthy breakfast on the go.</p><h2>Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast</h2><p>This satisfying peanut butter-banana toast gets a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra flavor boost.</p><h2>Everything Bagel Avocado Toast</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1kRAmH_everything_bagel_avocado_toast.jpg" alt="Everything Bagel Avocado Toast"><figcaption><em>. Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><p>Get all the flavor of an everything bagel married with the creaminess of avocado toast in one healthy breakfast. Just toast, top, sprinkle and go for this quick morning meal when you need to get out the door fast. Want to take it up a notch? Top with a poached or fried egg.</p><h2>Raspberry Yogurt Cereal Bowl</h2><p>For breakfast, snack or a healthy dessert, try using yogurt instead of milk for your cereal. If making this as a to-go snack, keep the cereal separate and top just before eating.</p><h2>Southwest Breakfast Quesadilla</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1a8Wg4_southwest_breakfast_quesadilla.jpg" alt="Southwest Breakfast Quesadilla"><figcaption><em>. Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pico de gallo and cheesy eggs make this quick breakfast flavorful and satisfying.</p><h2>Breakfast Beans with Microwave-Poached Egg</h2><p>In Costa Rica, this popular breakfast bean dish is called gallo pinto, which means spotted rooster, referring to the dark beans amid the pale rice. We call for cooked barley here, but you can use whatever leftover cooked grain you may have on hand.</p><h2>Baby Kale Breakfast Salad with Bacon & Egg</h2><p>Breakfast salad? Oh yes! Start your day off right with this healthy breakfast recipe. A bowl of good-for-you greens, such as baby kale, will knock out half of your daily veggie quota with the first meal of the day.</p></main>
