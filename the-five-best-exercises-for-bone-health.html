Probably the rock hard versions we see in museums belonging to people or animals who died a long time ago. Yet bones are living tissue and they bend, flex and move in remarkable ways in response to the stresses we place on them. And if we don’t test and stress them, they don’t grow for us. </p><p>For females this becomes a more apparent problem during menopause, with bone density reducing as oestrogen levels drop at a rapid rate. Across both genders it becomes a problem due to hormone changes, lifestyle factors, sickness and genetic predisposition, not to mention our shockingly low levels of vitamin D (around 80 per cent of people we test are low). It’s clear to see that it’s an issue which needs to be drastically addressed. </p><p>A largely unknown and somewhat surprising fact about our bones is that they reach their peak density in our 20s. After that, it’s a gradual and debilitating decline… potentially. The peak bone point is worth focusing on. If you are reading this in your teens and 20s you have an incredible opportunity to future-proof yourself by exercising hard, eating well, cutting back on the alcohol and getting plenty of sunlight; however if you are in your 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond it’s now about an exacting plan to regenerate your bone density and protect yourself. </p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1ocFeu_once_we_reach_the_point_of_having_osteoporosis_the_risk_of_dying_in_the_first_year_following_a_hip_break.jpg" alt="'Once we reach the point of having osteoporosis, the risk of dying in the first year following a hip break for those over 65 is elevated by a frightening 30 per cent,' writes Roberts"><figcaption><em>Our bones reach their peak density in our 20s, says Roberts - Andrew Crowley. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>According to bone expert Dr Taher Mahmud, while the highest risk of bone fractures is in those with osteoporosis, it is people in the category known as osteopenia that actually have the highest number of actual fractures. The reason for this? For most, it’s a low level of awareness, due to lack of scanning, that their bones have degenerated to the extent that they have. Then suddenly, they have a standing-height fall while doing regular activities that becomes a fracture and the problem is found far too late. </p><p>Once we reach the point of having osteoporosis the risk of dying in the first year following a hip break for those over 65 is elevated by a frightening 30 per cent. This is even higher for those with comorbidities. We have all seen people with stooped postures due to a long process of micro fractures of the spine which gradually and irreparably deform the spinal column beyond recovery or repair – something that is largely avoidable with early detection and intervention. </p><p>But do not despair. There is good news! Because there are two or three main routes to change all this. Medications such as teriparatide and various bisphosphonates build bone density effectively over a one- to two-year period (under medical guidance). But equally you can take action from this very moment, because very much within your own control are exercise and diet, the key critical inputs in rebuilding your bones. It’s this approach that Dr Mahmud recommends before commencing with a medication regime for those who are not yet experiencing fractures. </p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1ocDu3_for_anyone_with_osteopenia_or_those_wishing_to_prevent_it_exercises_that_involve_jumping_play_a_key_role.jpg" alt="For anyone with osteopenia or those wishing to prevent it, exercises that involve jumping play a key role in adding positive bone stress"><figcaption><em>Exercises that involve jumping play a key role in adding positive bone stress - Andrew Crowley. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>Resistance training, impact exercises and multi-directional training combined will produce a 12 to 15 per cent increase in bone density over a nine- to 12-month period when performed correctly. To give you an idea of the load required, multiple research data has shown that the best results come from using squats, lunges and deadlifts loaded with a resistance that allows as few as five or six reps per set for an area. In other words, pretty heavy! </p><p>However, I say this with a note of caution as most bodies are not ready for that level of loading without preconditioning, so we need to produce bone stress through small amounts of impact, using progressive weight level increases, lateral movements for stress variety and to ensure we use the upper and lower body combined rather than focus on the hips alone. For anyone with osteopenia or those wishing to prevent it, plyometric exercises (involving jumping) also play a key role in adding positive bone stress through the small vibration and higher muscle/tendon stress and trauma that the impact creates.</p><p>In our bone health clinic in my own facilities, our clients and patients use a specific strengthening machine that applies resistance and pressure to safely test and redevelop the bones to a high level without risk. Without that machine there are still several exercises you can perform to gain the strength, stability and balance needed to then be able to load heavily and get the greatest bone strength return. </p><p>In short, I want to build you up to prepare you to build even more! This is the programme you should follow…</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">1. Lateral jumps</h2><p>Start with 12-16 reps and build to around 30 over a period of weeks. </p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">2. Weighted step back lunge</h2><p>Start with around 6kg weights and progress up to 12-15kg. Try for 10 reps each leg and build towards 20 per set.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">3. Weighted single-leg deadlift</h2><p>You can begin with no weight and then add weight up to around 12-15kg. Try for 10-12 reps each side and build toward 20.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">4. Single leg hops</h2><p>Start with around 10-12 without toppling over and build to 20-25.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">5. Bench row</h2><p>This needs to be heavy enough that you can only do around 15 reps at first and then increase to a weight that only allows 10-12. </p><p>Perform the whole routine in order 3-5 times. </p><p><em>Recommended</em></p><p>Arthritis and joint pain – the symptoms to know about and how to treat it</p></main>
