    <main><h1>Migraine Self-Care: Diet, Avoiding Triggers, and More</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Huma Sheikh, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Huma Sheikh, MD</strong><p>A migraine is a complex neurological disorder with various symptoms that can affect the whole body, including throbbing headaches (frequently on just one side of the head), nausea or vomiting, dizziness, and sensitivity to light, touch, and sound.</p><p>Migraines are a leading cause of disability, and living with them can greatly impact daily life and overall physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Self-care practices can work alongside medical and other treatments to help reduce the burden of migraines.</p><p>This article covers everything readers need to know to better cope with migraines.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oEfpb_a_man_holding_his_face_uncomfortable_with_a_migraine.jpg" alt="A man holding his face uncomfortable with a migraine"><figcaption><em>Yasser Chalid / Getty Images.

In those who are susceptible to migraine, changes in hormone levels, sleep, eating patterns, environment, and stress are among the many things that can trigger a migraine attack.</p><p> <h2>What Is Migraine Self-Care Exactly?</h2><p>A migraine is a debilitating condition that can present physical, emotional, and social challenges. Migraine self-care helps provide relief from symptoms and also helps promote mental and emotional well-being to cope with these challenges.</p><h2>Avoiding Triggers</h2><p>Migraine triggers are stimuli that happen inside or outside of the body and increase the likelihood of a migraine attack in those who are susceptible to them. Many factors can trigger migraine attacks (stress, weather changes, hormonal changes, sleep issues, certain foods, etc.), and triggers are different for each individual.</p><p>A migraine diary or journal can help you identify triggers that might be contributing to migraine attacks so you can avoid them in the future. It's important to note that some things that seem like triggers, such as food cravings, tiredness, or light or sound sensitivity, might be early signals that a migraine attack is going to occur.</p><p>A migraine diary can be helpful for both you and your healthcare provider and should include:</p><ul><li>The date</li><li>Duration and severity of the attack</li><li>Symptoms</li><li>Other helpful information like what you ate, the weather, sleep, and any emotional or physical changes you were experiencing</li></ul><p><h3>The Four Phases of a Migraine Attack</h3><p>Migraine attacks have four distinct phases:</p><ul><li><strong>Prodrome</strong>: This phase can last hours or days and marks the beginning of a migraine attack. Symptoms include irritability, restlessness, depression, or frequent yawning or irritation.</li><li><strong>Aura</strong>: This phase is marked by visual and sensory disturbances and can last a few minutes to an hour. Only about one-third of people who get migraines experience auras.</li><li><strong>Headache</strong>: This phase can last from hours to three days. Many symptoms can occur, such as severe head pain, nausea, neck pain, and sensitivity to light or sound.</li><li><strong>Postdrome</strong>: Typically referred to as "migraine hangover," this phase can last one to two days and includes symptoms like fatigue, body aches, and difficulty concentrating.</li></ul><p> <h2>Diet for Migraines</h2><p>Missing a meal or not eating enough is a common cause of migraine attacks that may be related to drops in blood sugar. If you get migraines, you should eat regularly to help prevent or control migraine attacks.</p><p>Foods can also trigger migraines, although this occurs in less than 30% of people with migraines. For a food to be considered a migraine trigger, it must cause symptoms within 24 hours of consumption, more than half the time you eat that food.</p><p>Although certain foods and drinks such as alcohol, caffeine, and chocolate have been linked to migraine attacks, there is no research to back up the connection between any specific foods and migraines. In cases in which it's believed food is triggering a migraine, craving the food is an early sign of a migraine attack.</p><p>Instead of generally avoiding certain foods or drinks, if you have a migraine, you should:</p><ul><li>Write down what you eat and drink in a diary to see if anything in your diet might be a trigger.</li><li>Eat fresh, healthful foods free of chemicals.</li><li>Eat meals at regular times, having snacks in between if you're hungry.</li><li>Stay hydrated, as dehydration can increase the risk of a migraine attack.</li></ul><h2>Sleep</h2><p>Sleep and migraines are closely related. Getting too much or too little sleep can trigger a migraine, and sleep can also help relieve migraine symptoms.</p><p>Part of migraine self-care is practicing good sleep hygiene. This includes:</p><ul><li>Going to bed and getting up at the same time daily</li><li>Refraining from using electronics or drinking caffeine too close to bedtime</li><li>Practicing a nightly wind-down routine by doing something relaxing before bed</li></ul><h2>Environmental</h2><p>Weather changes, sitting in front of a computer, loud noises, and bright or flickering lights can all trigger migraines. Steps you can take to practice migraine self-care if you are experiencing environmental triggers include:</p><ul><li>Take regular breaks from looking at electronic devices.</li><li>Use an anti-glare screen for electronics.</li><li>Wear earplugs or ear defenders (noise-reducing earmuffs) if noise triggers or worsens attacks.</li><li>Wear tinted, blue-blocking, or red lenses if light triggers or worsens attacks.</li></ul><h2>Stress</h2><p>Stress, anxiety, and tension can trigger migraine attacks. It's also possible for a migraine to occur when you stop feeling stressed, such as on the weekend after a busy workweek.</p><p>Practicing self-care by reducing stress can help with pain and other symptoms of a migraine and help reduce your emotional response to stress.</p><p>Stress-reduction techniques that might help with migraines include:</p><ul><li>Practicing mindfulness and meditation (while seated or walking) or body scanning</li><li>Gentle, mindful movements such as hatha yoga</li><li>Deep breathing exercises</li><li>Acupuncture and acupressure</li></ul><h2>Physical</h2><p>Moderate exercise has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. However, in some people, exercise can trigger a migraine attack, especially if it's strenuous, you are dehydrated from sweating and heat, or you haven't eaten enough before exercising.</p><p>Mild exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes can be part of a migraine self-care strategy as long as it's an exercise that you enjoy. Some activities that might be helpful if you have migraine include:</p><ul><li>Jogging</li><li>Swimming</li><li>Dancing</li><li>Cycling</li><li>Brisk walking</li></ul><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>To prevent migraine attacks from exercise, eat at least 90 minutes beforehand to prevent low blood sugar, warm up sufficiently, and drink fluids before, during, and after exercise. Include exercise sessions in your symptom journal to see if they help or trigger migraine attacks.</p><h2>Take Medication as Directed</h2><p>If you take medication for migraines, it's important to take it as directed. If you have frequent migraines and have been prescribed medication to help prevent or relieve them, take the medication regularly or as advised by your healthcare provider.</p><h2>Treatment Options for Migraines</h2><p>Both medical and at-home treatments can help ease and control symptoms of a migraine attack. Some medications also are used to prevent migraines before they occur.</p><p>Medical treatments for migraines can be abortive, used to treat symptoms when a migraine attack occurs and keep symptoms from worsening, or preventive, meaning they're used to stop migraines from occurring. Treatments include:</p><ul><li>Over-the-counter and prescription oral medications</li><li>Injectable medications</li><li>Nerve blocks</li><li>Neuromodulation devices, including Cefaly and Nerivio, which deliver electrical pulses or mild electrical stimulation</li><li>Behavioral therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and biofeedback</li></ul><p>Steps you can take to treat a migraine at home include:</p><ul><li>Resting in a quiet, dark room</li><li>Placing a cool washcloth on your head</li><li>Trying to sleep</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Migraines are a debilitating neurological condition characterized by painful attacks triggered by internal and external factors. Though migraine attacks are often associated with headaches, the attacks also can cause physical symptoms that affect the entire body, along with mental and emotional symptoms. Practicing migraine self-care through lifestyle behaviors is an essential tool in meeting the challenges of living with migraines.</p></main></body>
