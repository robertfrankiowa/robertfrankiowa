Historically, chest pain was medically referred to as stethalgia, but this term is rarely used today. Having chest pain is a common medical complaint. In fact, about 5% of all emergency room cases in the U.S. are due to chest pain.</p><p>It's a common belief that chest pain only occurs if you're having a serious cardiac (heart-related) event, such as a heart attack. But, a variety of health conditions can contribute to the discomfort you're feeling in your chest. Regardless of what the underlying cause of your symptoms may be, if you start to experience chest pain, it's essential to seek medical care immediately so a provider can help you manage your symptoms and prevent any life-threatening complications.</p><h2>What Does Chest Pain Feel Like? </h2><p>Chest pains can feel different from person to person and often depends on what's causing the discomfort. The pain can be chronic (long-term), come and go, or get worse with breathing, or physical exertion and exercise. </p><p>Sometimes the pain can be “visceral," which means that you're experiencing a dull, ongoing ache that spreads across wider areas of the chest. Visceral pain can also cause tightness, squeezing, or pressure. In other cases, the pain is localized, meaning it affects a specific spot on your chest. This type of pain can feel like a stabbing or poking sensation. Localized pain can sometimes radiate (or, spread) to the jaw, neck, back, shoulders, or both arms.</p><h2>Types of Chest Pain</h2><p>Chest pain refers to any pain or discomfort in the area below the neck and above your abdomen. You can experience chest pain in the middle of your chest, or on the left or right side. Healthcare providers categorize chest pain into two main types: cardiac (related to the heart) and non-cardiac (related to other organs such as the digestive system or lungs).</p><h3>Cardiac Chest Pain</h3><p>If your chest pain is due to underlying problems with the heart, a provider classifies this as cardiac chest pain. Heart-related chest pains cause tightness, pressure, and pain on the left side of your chest where your heart is located. The pain can sometimes also spread to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm.</p><h3>Non-Cardiac Chest Pain</h3><p>All other cases of chest pain that are not related to the heart are classified as non-cardiac chest pain. This category contains several subtypes, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Gastrointestinal chest pain: </strong>Occurs when you have problems with your esophagus—the long tube that connects the organs between your mouth and stomach. Issues with your esophagus can often cause heartburn, which is a burning sensation that develops in the middle of your chest, behind the sternum (breastbone), and up to the throat. Peptic ulcers (sores in your stomach lining) can also cause a burning type of pain in your chest.</li><li><strong>Pulmonary chest pain: </strong>Happens when a condition that affects your lungs causes pain and discomfort in your chest. Sometimes, problems with your diaphragm—a muscular tissue that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen and plays a role in your breathing—can also lead to chest pain.</li><li><strong>Musculoskeletal chest pain: </strong>Develops when you experience an injury to the bones and muscles of the chest, including the ribs, spine, and pectoral (chest) muscles. This type of pain often worsens when you breathe or physically exert yourself.</li></ul><h2>Potential Causes of Chest Pain</h2><p>Several conditions can cause chest pain. Heart problems represent only a portion of all chest pain cases. Conditions that affect the digestive system, lungs, and muscles, and bones are among other common causes of the discomfort you feel in your chest.</p><h3>Acid Reflux</h3><p>Acid reflux occurs when stomach acids flow back up the esophagus and irritate the lining of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract and throat. You might have acid reflux after you eat certain foods (such as spicy foods) or if you have an underlying condition that affects your GI tract, such as gastroesophagealreflux disease (GERD). The most common symptom of acid reflux is heartburn, but you can also experience regurgitation, nausea, difficulty swallowing, or a hoarse voice.</p><h3>Heart Attack</h3><p>A heart attack (medically known as a myocardial infarction) occurs when there's not enough blood flow in your heart due to a blockage or blood clot. A heart attack is a medical emergency and can cause chest pain, pressure, and tightness. Additional signs of a heart attack include:</p><ul><li>Pain radiating to the left arm, shoulders, upper abdomen, back, or jaw </li><li>Hand numbness</li><li>Nausea and vomiting </li><li>Sweating</li><li>Lightheadedness</li><li>Difficulty breathing</li></ul><h3>Coronary Artery Disease</h3><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common types of heart disease that occurs when you have a build-up of plaque (such as fatty substances and cholesterol) in your arteries—your heart's blood vessels. This heart disease can also affect blood flow, increase your risk of a heart attack, and cause chest pain that worsens with exercise, emotional stress, or eating large meals.</p><h3>Pericarditis </h3><p>Pericarditis is the inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the heart, which is called the pericardium. Oftentimes, this inflammation occurs due to a viral infection. As a result, you might experience shortness of breath and sharp chest pain when you inhale. Chest pain with pericarditis worsens when you're lying down and tends to improve when you sit up.</p><h3>Aortic Dissection</h3><p>Aortic dissection occurs when the inner layer of the aorta—the major artery that pumps oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your body—tears. This tear causes bleeding into the middle layer of this artery.</p><p>With aortic dissection, it's common to experience sudden, very sharp pain in the center or left side of your chest. The pain can also spread down your torso as the tear or rip grows. Additional signs of this condition include:</p><ul><li>Backache</li><li>Difficulty breathing</li><li>Rapid or weak pulse </li><li>Fainting</li><li>Pale skin </li><li>Sweating </li><li>Nausea</li><li>Anxiety</li></ul><h3>Injury</h3><p>Injury to the chest bones or pectoral muscle strain can often cause pain in the muscles around the ribs and chest cavity. When you experience an injury to your chest, your chest can become inflamed, which causes the pain. As your body heals, the pain will slowly go away, too.</p><h3>Peptic Ulcer </h3><p>A peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. If you develop a peptic ulcer, the pain can often spread from the upper abdomen and to the chest. You'll likely experience some discomfort after eating or when lying down to sleep at night. It's also possible to have symptoms like feeling too full, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and belching (burping).</p><h3>Pleurisy </h3><p>Pleurisy—the inflammation of the outer lung tissues—causes sharp, stabbing chest pain, which gets worse with coughing or breathing. More signs of an underlying lung problem that can often occur with pleurisy include shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, bluish skin, racing heart rate, and anxiety.</p><h3>Pulmonary Embolism</h3><p>A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood vessel in your lung becomes blocked. This blockage usually occurs if a blood clot travels to your lungs. This life-threatening condition causes a range of symptoms, including stabbing pain under the breastbone, achy or dull pain in the chest, burning, and heaviness in the chest. Other signs include:</p><ul><li>Dizziness</li><li>Fainting </li><li>Wheezing</li><li>Rapid breathing</li><li>Pain in the legs  </li><li>Low blood pressure</li><li>Coughing up blood</li><li>Low-grade fever</li><li>Bluish-colored skin</li></ul><h3>Pneumonia</h3><p>Another respiratory (lung-related) condition that causes chest pain is pneumonia—a bacterial infection of the lungs. The pain can occur due to mucus buildup in the alveoli (lung sacs) of the lungs. Pneumonia also causes fever, chills, and breathing difficulties.</p><p>Chest pain and tightness are common symptoms of a panic attack—a sudden episode of uncontrollable fear or anxiety. Panic attacks can often feel like heart attacks, and may cause symptoms such as:</p><ul><li>Rapid heart rate</li><li>Sweating </li><li>Chills</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Weakness</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Tingling or numbness in the hands</li><li>Shaking or trembling</li></ul><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Chest pains have a variety of causes, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. Either way, if you're experiencing chest pain, it's important to contact your provider right away or call 911 if you or a loved one may be experiencing a medical emergency. Symptoms of a medical emergency may include:</p><ul><li>Tightness, pain, and pressure in the central left part of the chest that stays a few minutes and goes away, or doesn’t go away at all</li><li>Fainting or loss of consciousness</li><li>Pain that spreads to the back, neck, jaw, or arms</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Coughing up blood</li><li>Bluish-colored skin</li></ul><h2>How Providers Diagnose Chest Pain</h2><p>Identifying the cause of the chest pain is critical before a provider can treat you for your symptoms. Your healthcare provider will first assess your medical history, perform a physical exam, and take your vital signs (such as blood pressure and heart rate). Your provider may also order additional tests to learn more about your chest pain, such as:</p><ul><li>Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), which takes detailed images of the heart</li><li>Imaging tests like a chest X-ray or ultrasound</li><li>Blood tests</li><li>Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to screen the lungs for pulmonary embolism</li><li>Upper GI endoscopy, which uses a specialized camera to view any issues with the esophagus or stomach</li></ul><h2>Treatment Options</h2><p>Common treatment options for chest pain include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgical procedures. Your exact treatment plan will depend on the underlying cause of your symptoms and your overall health status.</p><p>If your chest pain is due to a heart attack or an underlying heart problem, the goal of treatment is to restore healthy blood flow to the heart. Treatment options may include:</p><ul><li>Medications such as blood thinners, antiarrhythmic drugs (for an irregular heartbeat), and thrombolytic drugs (for blood clots)</li><li>Oxygen therapy</li><li>Percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI), which is a minimally invasive procedure that places a stent in the heart's arteries to restore blood flow</li><li>Bypass surgery, which creates a new path for blood to flow in and out of your heart when you have a narrow or blocked blood vessel</li></ul><p>If non-cardiac conditions are causing your chest pain, treatment options look a bit different. Your healthcare provider may recommend the following ways to find relief, depending on what's causing your chest pain:</p><ul><li>Taking antacids such as Tums (calcium carbonate) or Prilosec (omeprazole) to improve heartburn</li><li>Managing obesity through exercise, diet, or weight-loss surgery to reduce acid reflux symptoms</li><li>Using medications such as thrombolytic drugs or blood thinners to help treat a pulmonary embolism</li><li>Practicing visualization, meditation, or deep-breathing techniques to relax your body after a panic attack</li><li>Incorporating lifestyle changes such as getting enough exercise, eating a heart-healthy diet, and quitting smoking to prevent heart disease and cardiac complications</li><li>Getting antibiotics to reduce pneumonia symptoms</li><li>Allowing yourself to rest and recover if you've experienced a chest injury</li></ul><h2>How to Prevent Chest Pain</h2><p>While some bouts of chest pain happen suddenly, there are ways to lower your chances of experiencing pain. Prevention strategies for chest pain usually involve making lifestyle changes to prevent heart disease and improve heart health. These methods include:</p><ul><li>Eating a heart-healthy diet, such as lean protein, fresh vegetables, fruit, and whole grains</li><li>Managing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, which increases the risk of heart disease</li><li>Getting regular exercise or physical activity</li><li>Sleeping at least 7 hours per night</li><li>Avoiding heavy alcohol consumption</li><li>Quitting tobacco use</li><li>Sleeping with your head elevated to prevent acid reflux</li><li>Limiting spicy, greasy, and fatty foods to reduce the risk of heartburn</li></ul><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Chest pain, isn’t only a sign of heart problems. Acid reflux, lung diseases, ulcers, and panic attacks are among many potential causes of this issue. Depending on what's causing your symptoms, treatments for chest pain range from lifestyle changes to surgeries. If you have chest pain, it's in your best interest to contact a healthcare provider to reduce your risk of complications and receive timely treatment.</p></main>
