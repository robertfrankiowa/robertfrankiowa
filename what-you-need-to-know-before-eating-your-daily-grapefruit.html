    <main><h1>What You Need To Know Before Eating Your Daily Grapefruit</h1><p>Thanks to the grapefruit diet, you probably think of healthy and wellness when you think of grapefruits. The citrus fruit is certainly healthy, and some people start every morning by eating half of one. But is it healthy to eat grapefruit <em>every day</em>? </p><p>Well, that depends on a few factors. With the help of Rosemary Trout, professor of food science at Drexel University, here's what you need to know about grapefruit and its health benefits and implications. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Can You Eat Grapefruit Every Day?</h2><p class="body-text">Yes, it's healthy to eat grapefruit every day, but there's one important caveat. Grapefruit contains metabolic compounds called furanocoumarins. These compounds can interfere with processes that are essential to cellular metabolism. Important: If you're taking statins or medications for conditions like high blood pressure, cholesterol, heart arrhythmia, organ transplants, or allergies, it can be dangerous to eat grapefruit. If you take any medications, you should talk with your doctor about whether it's safe to eat grapefruit. </p><p>"If you are not on medications that have this interfering effect, then enjoy as much grapefruit as you like!" Trout said.</p><figure><img title="Andrew bui" src="IMG/AA1346cC_grapefruit_goat_cheese_fennel_salad.jpg" alt="Grapefruit & Goat Cheese Fennel Salad"><figcaption><em>Get the recipe: Grapefruit & Goat Cheese Fennel Salad.

One cup of grapefruit contains over 100% of your daily vitamin C, in addition to fiber, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin B6, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Grapefruit is rich in the antioxidant lycopene, which tomatoes are also known for. </p><p>"Citrus is ripe and best during the winter months, when nutritional density is at its peak," said Trout. In addition to fresh grapefruit, you can buy it canned or jarred. Trout said it might those options have more sugar; contain additives like sodium benzoate or added coloring; and if it's labeled "no sugar, added" it could have artificial sweeteners like acesulfame potassium or sucralose.</p><p>A lot of people drink grapefruit juice more often than they eat fresh grapefruit. But Trout says if you're after all the nutrients the fruit has to offer, stick with the whole fruit. "Grapefruit juice is also nutrient dense, but you will be missing some of the fiber, and glucose will be more concentrated, so it is really good to stick with the whole fruit for the full complement of nutritional benefits that grapefruits offer," said Trout.</p><h2 class="body-h2">What's The Best Way To Eat Grapefruit?</h2><p>Grapefruit is often sprinkled with sugar, but Trout has a better alternative to cut the bitterness. "Instead, try a light sprinkle of salt instead of sugar, especially after a few minutes under the broilerâ€”it will minimize bitterness, maximize sweetness, and doesn't have any extra calories from added sugar," she said.</p><p>Don't want to eat a grapefruit as-is? There are plenty of ways to add it to recipes. Slice it up to top salads or fish dishes. You can also add grapefruit to a nutrient-dense smoothie. </p><p>"Grapefruit is super versatile and can be eaten in savory and sweet applications," Trout said, "and a squeeze in a cup of hot or cold tea is a nice change of pace!" </p></main>
