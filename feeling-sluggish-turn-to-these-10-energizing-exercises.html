    <main><h1>Feeling Sluggish? Turn to These 10 Energizing Exercises</h1><p>If you get tired midday more often than not, you’re certainly not alone. The afternoon slump affects many of us, as least from time to time. Eating a healthy, well-balanced diet and getting a good night’s sleep can certainly help fight off fatigue. But you can also turn to some midday movement to invigorate your system and help you feel more awake. </p><p>Research backs this up: A review published in <em>Frontiers of Psychology </em>found that moderate-intensity exercise can improve fatigue, vitality, and energy in healthy individuals—even those with chronic health conditions. And a meta-analysis included in that review says that even a 20- to 40-minute single bout of activity can increase feelings of energy.</p><p>While you could head out for a run, if you want to knock out energy exercises indoors, we tapped a yoga instructor and two run coaches to offer up quick and easy moves to help you fight off that afternoon fatigue. You can also do these moves before a run on days you’re feeling less than motivated to start clocking miles, and need a bit more pep in your step! </p><h2 class="body-h2">5 Yoga Poses for More Energy </h2><p>If you want a quick flow to loosen up your joints and feel rejuvenated, try this five-pose sequence from Steph Creaturo, RRCA level 1 run coach, and yoga instructor in Brooklyn, New York. </p><p>“One of my-go to yoga sequences for more energy is also a great running warmup. The classic ‘half sun salute’ guides our bodies through a sequence of linked movements that warms up our joints, activates the main running muscle groups, and nudges our thinking brain to pay attention to where our body is in space,” says Creaturo. </p><p><strong>How to use this list: </strong>Do the yoga moves in order below, doing 1 to 2 rounds before a run, when you’re feeling tired midday, or as often as you want throughout the week. </p><p>You’ll need a yoga mat and two yoga blocks or a chair. </p><h3 class="body-h3">1. Mountain Pose (<em>Tadasana</em>)</h3><figure><img title="Thomas Hengge" src="IMG/BB1j7YLT_energy_mountain_pose2578previewmaxwidth3000maxheight3000ppi300quality75jpg.jpg" alt="Energy-Mountain-Pose2578_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_300_quality_75.jpg"><figcaption><em>energy exercises, mountain pose. Thomas Hengge</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Why it works</strong>: “Thanks to our tech-driven lives, we can be in a turtle shell shape in our back (especially our upper back) and not know it. Mountain pose calls on us to stand tall through the spinal column,” says Creaturo.</p><p><strong>How to do it: </strong></p><ol><li>Stand tall with feet hip-width apart, hands at side, palms facing forward and open.</li><li>Lift and spread toes then press them firmly into the floor,</li><li>Engage glutes, legs, and core, and bring shoulder blades down and back. Gaze forward. </li><li>Hold for 3-5 breaths.</li></ol><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>2. Hands Overhead (</strong><strong><em>Tadasana Urdhva Hastasana</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Hands overhead is great for runners because it moves our arms into a different shape (overhead). By creating freedom for the shoulders from the rib cage, this pose can help our arm swing be a little more fluid, says Creaturo. </p><p><strong>How to do it: </strong></p><ol><li>From mountain pose inhale and reach arms overhead, biceps by ears, palms facing each other.</li><li>Keep feet pressed to the floor as shoulders gently lift away from ribs. </li><li>Stretch through the elbow crease and allow eyes to gaze slightly upward. </li><li>Hold for 3-5 breaths.</li></ol><h3 class="body-h3">3. Forward Fold (<em>Uttanasana</em>)</h3><figure><img title="Thomas Hengge" src="IMG/BB1j80UL_energy_forward_fold2572previewmaxwidth3000maxheight3000ppi300quality75jpg.jpg" alt="Energy-Forward-fold2572_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_300_quality_75.jpg"><figcaption><em>energy exercises, forward fold. Thomas Hengge</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This mobility move can help the upper and lower back feel less stiff while running, says Creaturo. </p><p><strong>How to do it: </strong></p><ol><li>Keep feet hip-width apart. Optional: Place a yoga block a few inches in front of feet for stability.</li><li>Exhale and bend knees slightly. Round back into a cat shape. Tuck chin to chest. </li><li>Slowly fold forward one vertebrae at a time. Let arms fall and hang loosely at sides, or touch the yoga blocks with hands.</li><li>Hold for 3-5 breaths. </li></ol><h3 class="body-h3">4. Runner’s Lunge (<em>Utthita Ashwa Sanchalanasana</em>)</h3><figure><img title="Thomas Hengge" src="IMG/BB1j7Uks_energy_runners_lunge2576previewmaxwidth3000maxheight3000ppi300quality75jpg.jpg" alt="Energy-Runners-Lunge2576_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_300_quality_75.jpg"><figcaption><em>energy exercises, runners lunge. Thomas Hengge</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Why it works: </strong>This pose is great if you’re sitting for a prolonged period of time, as it provides a stretch to the hips, groin, and hamstrings. </p><p><strong>How to do it: </strong></p><ol><li>Inhale and fold forward. Place hands on yoga blocks on the outside of each ankle, place hands on the seat of a stable chair, or on the ground, framing feet. </li><li>Lift chest and step right leg back behind you.</li><li>Keep right heel in line with right hip. Keep right knee straight or lower it to the floor. </li><li>Keep left knee bent about 90 degrees and over left ankle. </li><li>Gaze forward, bring arms up overhead, biceps by ears, palms facing one another. Or keep hands on yoga blocks or floor. </li><li>Engage the right glute and hamstring. </li><li>Hold for 5 breaths. </li><li>Step right foot forward and stand back up. </li><li>Repeat on other side.</li></ol><h3 class="body-h3">5. Twisted Lunge (<em>Parivrtta Anjaneyasana</em>)</h3><figure><img title="Thomas Hengge" src="IMG/BB1j7YM3_energy_twisted_lunge2579previewmaxwidth3000maxheight3000ppi300quality75jpg.jpg" alt="Energy-Twisted-Lunge2579_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_300_quality_75.jpg"><figcaption><em>energy exercises, twisted lunge. Thomas Hengge</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Why it works:</strong> This is a great pose for runners because as much as we love running, it’s a repetitive sport that keeps us in one plane of motion (forward and back), says Creaturo. To help us move in the transverse plane—which involves rotational movements—practice this pose, which also stretches the sides of the body. </p><p><strong>How to do it: </strong></p><ol><li>Stand at top of yoga mat. Optional: Place yoga blocks on either side of the feet.</li><li>Place hands on mat, step right foot back so leg is outstretched behind you, heel lifted. Bend left knee to stack above left ankle at 90 degrees.</li><li>Keeping right hand on mat or yoga block, raise left hand up toward ceiling, while turning torso toward the front left knee.</li><li>Gaze up toward lifted left hand.</li><li>Hold for 5 breaths.</li><li>Repeat on other side. </li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">5 Strength Moves for More Energy </h2><p>Run coaches Lisa Levin and Julie Sapper, both RRCA-certified run coaches of Run Farther and Faster in Montgomery County, Maryland provide these moves to get your heart pumping and body warmed up when you’re feeling less than energized. </p><p>“These moves are particularly effective for boosting energy because they promote blood flow to the muscles, specifically the muscles that are key to efficient running form. Runners can do these exercises as a dynamic warmup to activate muscles before a run, or on their own any time they need an energy boost,” says Levin. </p><p><strong>How to use this list:</strong> Do this list of moves before a run or anytime you’re looking for an energy boost throughout the week. Follow the reps listed below, completing each move in order for 1 round. </p><p>You’ll need an exercise mat and access to a wall. You can also use a dumbbell or a kettlebell for these moves for an extra challenge and kick in heart rate and muscle activation.</p><h3 class="body-h3">1. Alternating Glute Bridge</h3><p><strong>Why it works: </strong>“Alternating glute bridges before a run helps runners activate their glute muscles, which will improve runners’ form and power,” says Sapper. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p><ol><li>Lie faceup with feet on the floor, hip-width apart and knees bent. </li><li>Without arching back, lift hips by engaging glutes.</li><li>Lift left leg, foot off mat and both knees in line. </li><li>Lower hips back to the mat, keeping left leg lifted.</li><li>Place left foot back down to the mat.</li><li>Slowly lift hips again, engaging glutes. </li><li>This time lift right leg, foot off mat, both knees in line. </li><li>Lower hips back down to to the mat with right leg raised. </li><li>Place right foot back down on the mat.</li><li>Continue alternating for 8-12 reps on each leg. </li></ol><h3 class="body-h3">2. Wall Sit With Alternating Heel Raise</h3><p><strong>Why it works: </strong>“In addition to activating your glutes before a run, you also want to activate your quads to ensure that you are engaging them, particularly if your run involves any downhills,” says Levin. This move will help you do just that.</p><p><strong>How to do it: </strong></p><ol><li>Find a sturdy wall and rest hips, back, and shoulders against it. </li><li>While pressing against the wall, lower hips until knees bend 90 degrees, with knees directly over ankles. </li><li>While in that position, lift and lower each heel one at a time without shifting hips and maintaining wall-sit position. </li><li>Continue alternating for 40 reps, 20 on each side. </li></ol><h3 class="body-h3">3. Mountain Climber</h3><p><strong><strong>Why it works: </strong></strong>Mountain climbers help engage the core muscles, and increase the heart rate slightly to warm up the body before heading out for a run, says Sapper. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p><ol><li>Start in a high plank position with shoulders stacked directly over wrists, hands placed shoulder-width apart, and core engaged so body forms a straight line from shoulders to hips to heels. </li><li>Keep neck relaxed by looking down between hands. Engage glutes, quads, and thighs to keep legs straight. </li><li>With a tight core, initiate the movement by driving left knee in toward chest, then quickly stepping it back to plank position. </li><li>Immediately drive the right knee in toward chest, then quickly step it back to plank position. </li><li>Continue alternating for a total of 40 reps, 20 on each side. Aim for a rapid pace while using good form.</li></ol><h3 class="body-h3">4. Lateral Lunge</h3><p class="body-text"><strong>Why it works: </strong>Side lunges allow runners a rare opportunity to work in a different plane of motion, which improves balance and mobility. This move will also get your heart rate up, says Levin.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p><ol><li>Stand with feet together, hands in front of chest.</li><li>Take a large step to the left and, keeping back flat and chest up, push hips back as you bend left knee into a lateral lunge. </li><li>Push through left foot to stand back up. </li><li>Repeat. Do 8 reps. </li><li>Repeat on other side.</li></ol><p><strong>Why it works: “</strong>Fire hydrants improve mobility by opening up tight hip flexors (often due to sitting) and activating the glute muscles,” says Levin.</p></main>
