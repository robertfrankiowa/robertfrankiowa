    <main><h1>This 1 simple habit can reduce back pain and improve your overall health</h1><p>There’s no shortage of reasons to make walking a daily habit <em>—</em> from improving heart health to boosting metabolism to combatting stress and anxiety. And now, preventing back pain is another benefit you can tack onto the laundry list of reasons to get those steps in.</p><p>A new study published in The Lancet found that people who went on a 30-minute walk, five times a week (and also received behavioral coaching) had fewer reoccurrences of back pain, took less time off from work and had less medical visits.</p><p>In fact, participants who walked on a regular basis after an episode of back pain were pain free almost twice as long as those who didn't walk.</p><p>“Walking is an ideal option in terms of physical activity. It requires no specialized skill — everyone knows how to walk. It’s low impact and safe,” Dr. Cedric Bryant, president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, tells TODAY.com.</p><p>Need a little more convincing? Learn more of the impressive health benefits that come with making walking a part of your routine.</p><h2>The physical benefits of walking</h2><p>“Many of the systems of the body can benefit from walking,” Bryant says. Walking can help:</p><ul><li>Improve your cardiovascular health and function</li><li>Increase your aerobic capacity</li><li>Improve blood pressure</li><li>Control your blood sugar and reduce your risk of diabetes</li><li>Increase your metabolism</li><li>Maintain your weight</li><li>Reduce your risk or osteoarthritis</li><li>Maintain mobility</li></ul><p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 150 to 300 minutes a week, so 30 minutes of brisk walking for five days a week gets you into the low end of that range.</p><p>If you’re walking to manage your weight or lose weight, you’ll probably want to walk for longer. Bryant says to work up to 45 to 60 minutes of walking most days. That doesn’t have to be all at once, though. A 30-minute morning walk and a 20-minute walk after dinner would count.</p><p>If you’ve built a walking routine and you want to make your walks more challenging, try wearing a weighted vest or working hills into your walk, Bryant said.</p><h2>The mental benefits of walking</h2><p>Walking can help improve your psychological and mental health, especially if you walk outdoors.</p><p>“Walking outside, being in nature, and getting out of the same place allows you to decompress, understand what’s been going on and refocus,” Dr. Mark A. Slabaugh, an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, tells TODAY.com. “In my experience, it helps you to be able to almost meditate, to get in touch with your thoughts, to understand what’s important and to relax.”</p><p>Bryant is also a fan of getting outdoors for your walk: “There are so many wonderful benefits in terms of being able to have that positive distraction, a change in scenery, and getting sunlight and fresh air,” he says.</p><p>Taking a family member or friend along gives you a dose of socializing, which is also good for your mental health.</p><p>A walk can also help clear your mind and enhance your creativity. “I use walking on a personal level when I’m writing an article or editing a book — when I get stuck, I go out and walk,” Bryant says.</p><h2>How to make walking a habit</h2><p>Once you start your walking consistantly, you’ll probably find that you like it so much you’ll increase it. Here are some easy ways to get started and keep it up:</p></main>
