    <main><h1>3 high-earners share when they knew it was time to quit their 6-figure jobs: 'It was literally driving me to the edge'</h1><p><ul class="summary-list"><li>Three high-earners quit six-figure jobs to prioritize their mental health.</li><li>They said they struggled to manage high-pressure workdays and a lack of support.</li><li>They found new careers that offer flexibility and better work-life balance.</li></ul><p>Six-figure salaries can come with extremely demanding workloads and higher stakes. This can feel unmanageable without a supportive work environment, and in some cases, employees are left to choose between their paycheck or their mental health.</p><p>Business Insider spoke with three high-earners who left their six-figure jobs to save their mental health. They each started their careers eager to make a splash in their industry but said they were quickly disillusioned by high-pressure, exhausting workdays and tough feedback.</p><p>When their mental health plummeted, they felt they had no choice but to quit.</p><h2>Jean Kang was overwhelmed by her company's 'hustle culture'</h2><p>Thirty-one-year-old Jean Kang initially loved the perks and six-figure salaries that came with her different jobs in Big Tech.</p><p>"I was spoiled with tech benefits in every role — great pay, free food, remote work, gym memberships, massages, and more," Kang told BI.</p><p>Despite the unique perks, Kang said she felt immense pressure to overdeliver and outperform competitors — a virtue of the "hustle culture" that dominated her workplace. Kang said she struggled with the realization that she'd given her life to jobs that were ultimately just making big companies more money.</p><p>"My biggest fear was failing, but I knew I'd regret not betting on myself and could always land another job after I tried this," Kang said.</p><p>She shared that her anxiety and "Sunday scaries" disappeared once she became her own boss. She said working a flexible, remote job has been liberating.</p><p>"I now choose what projects make me happy and don't give myself too much pressure to succeed. I work 30 to 40 hours and some weekends now, but not because I have to — I <em>want</em> to."</p><h2>Eric Yu suffered from panic attacks at work for 6 months</h2><p>Long work days of intense coding turned into long nights of worrying about what needed to get done. He said he stayed late to finish tasks but still faced tough criticism from engineers. He told BI that he started experiencing panic attacks — which continued for six debilitating months.</p><p>"I was at the lowest point in my life. Every day felt like a grind — I didn't know what I was doing or why I was still working," Yu said.</p><p>He said it wasn't until his boss seriously questioned his work output that he made a pledge to himself to quit tech. After brainstorming alternative income streams with his fiancée, Wanda, he quit his job and settled on house hacking.</p><p>He's now making passive income from real estate and using his extra time to explore what he really wants in life.</p><h2>A former McKinsey employee had to go on mental-health disability leave</h2><p>A former McKinsey employee, who asked to remain anonymous because of privacy concerns, told BI that he knew his associate role would be tough. Still, he said he was willing to stick it out to sharpen his analytical skills. He didn't expect, however, the all-consuming nature of his work.</p><p>He told BI he worked 16-hour shifts at a job with extremely high expectations but a lack of mentorship and had to deal with mean coworkers.</p><p>"And it was pedal to the metal — I didn't leave my desk, forgot to eat, and dropped tons of weight," he said. "I barely remembered to go to the bathroom. I only remembered to get up when I noticed my dog looking at me sadly."</p><p>He said that after a year, he reached his breaking point.</p><p>"It was literally driving me to the edge. I just couldn't do it anymore. I was crying more and taking anxiety medication at a higher dosage than I had ever needed before joining," he said.</p><p>He said his time away from work only confirmed the severity of his condition when he found it difficult to take care of himself or even leave his home. He decided to quit McKinsey to focus on his mental health.</p><p>A year after quitting, he said his mental health improved and he's ready to reenter the workforce.</p><p>"As I look for a new job, I'm looking for companies that care about their employees, value inclusivity, and treat everyone with respect."</p><p> <p>If you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.</p></main>
