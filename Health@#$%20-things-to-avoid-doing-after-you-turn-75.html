    <main><h1>20 Things to Avoid Doing After You Turn 75</h1><p><p>Turning 75 means we need to slow down in life. We should start prioritizing our health, ensuring we’re constantly looking after ourselves. We’re no longer as young and springy as we once were. Here are 20 things to avoid doing after you turn 75.</p><h2>Avoiding Regular Medical Checkups</h2><p>Developing Healthy Communities writes, “Regular health checkups are like routine maintenance for your body, helping you identify and address potential health problems before they become serious.” Avoiding regular checkups means doctors won’t be able to detect any health issues in their early stages, which is when they’re best treated.</p><h2>Neglecting Physical Activity</h2><p>Turning 75 doesn’t mean you should stop taking part in physical activity. Instead, you may want to think about heading out for walks, swimming, or yoga. These low-impact exercises will still help with your mobility and should improve your overall health. Sometimes, nothing beats a walk on a sunny day.</p><h2>Ignoring Mental Health</h2><p>Seniors can face many mental health challenges. Chronic issues can bring you down, as can feelings of loneliness or isolation. It’s important to seek help if you need it, whether that’s from a professional or even speaking to a loved one. You can keep your mind stimulated through daily puzzles, which should also improve brain health.</p><figure><img title="Ignoring Mental Health" src="IMG/BB1pRUQ1_ignoring_mental_health.jpg" alt="Ignoring Mental Health"><figcaption><em>Ignoring Mental Health.

Having a shower and brushing your teeth each day can benefit your mental health and your overall well-being. Poor hygiene can even lead to infections and other health conditions, so it’s important to keep up a routine.</p><figure><img title="Not Keeping Up With Personal Hygiene" src="IMG/BB1pRNB2_not_keeping_up_with_personal_hygiene.jpg" alt="Not Keeping Up With Personal Hygiene"><figcaption><em>Not Keeping Up With Personal Hygiene.

For example, Be Well Line says, “Knowing the signs you are isolating yourself is crucial because self-isolation can harm mental and physical health. It can lead to depression, anxiety, substance abuse, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.” Make sure to stay in contact with your loved ones or participate in community activities.</p><figure><img title="Isolating Yourself" src="IMG/BB1pRLcd_isolating_yourself.jpg" alt="Isolating Yourself"><figcaption><em>Isolating Yourself.

Healthy foods will provide you with more energy and this can be very beneficial in your senior years. A balanced diet will also keep your body healthy and your organs working effectively.</p><figure><img title="Ignoring Your Diet" src="IMG/BB1pRLcg_ignoring_your_diet.jpg" alt="Ignoring Your Diet"><figcaption><em>Ignoring Your Diet.

This can include putting up rails, installing a stair lift, and making sure there are no tripping hazards. By doing this, you’ll be preventing any accidents, which can be very dangerous when you’re 75 and older.</p><h2>Disregarding Mobility Aids</h2><p>Your mobility is no doubt going to deteriorate as you get older, which means things such as canes or a wheelchair may become your best friend. They allow you to still get out of your house, giving you the chance for some fresh air.</p><h2>Continuing Risky Driving Habits</h2><p>You should constantly be assessing whether it’s still safe for you to drive when you become a senior. If you find yourself struggling with your vision or reaction times, then you may want to think about giving it up. You should stop risky driving habits such as speeding and passing unsafely.</p><h2>Ignoring Sleep Issues</h2><p>Ignoring sleep issues can be very harmful to your health. For example, the BBC explains that reduced sleep can lead to cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. It’s common for seniors to experience sleep problems, but if they feel long-lasting, then they shouldn’t be ignored.</p><h2>Neglecting Eye and Ear Health</h2><p>Your eyes and ears are going to be more susceptible to health conditions as you age. It’s important to have regular checkups, as you may need glasses or hearing aids. Eye exams will also help to determine if there are any underlying conditions, which can then be treated before they become a more serious concern.</p><h2>Ignoring Symptoms of Chronic Conditions</h2><p>Chronic conditions are more likely to develop in your older years. If you have any symptoms, then it’s important that you don’t ignore them, as they can become serious. If chronic conditions are spotted early, then they’re easier to manage, and healthcare providers will be able to help you with medications.</p><h2>Too Much Exercise</h2><p>Overdoing yourself with exercise can lead to many injuries. You can pull muscles and drop weights on yourself. Your muscles take longer to recover in your senior years and it could create mobility issues for a while. There are low-impact exercises you can do if you still enjoy working out your body.</p><h2>Dismissing the Importance of Hydration</h2><p>It can be hard to believe that something as simple as water can have such an important effect on your health. However, it has numerous health benefits and is needed to ensure your organs work properly. Signs of dehydration can include headaches and dizziness, so make sure to drink two liters a day.</p><h2>Failing to Keep Your Brain Active</h2><p>Harvard Health recommends keeping your brain active by staying physically active, getting enough sleep, stopping smoking, and having no more than one drink a day. Social interaction is also a great way to keep your brain active. Doing these activities will ensure cognitive health is the best it can be.</p><h2>Ignoring Stress Management</h2><p>Stress can affect you both mentally and physically, which is why it’s so important to manage it. If you feel yourself getting worked up, you may want to think about going for a walk, trying breathing techniques, or speaking to a loved one. Make sure you always dedicate some of your time to self-care.</p><h2>Skipping Dental Care</h2><p>If you don’t look after your teeth, then it can affect your overall well-being. You need to make sure you’re brushing your teeth for two minutes twice a day, flossing, and using mouthwash. Don’t skip dentist checkups, as issues with your teeth can become very painful.</p><h2>Avoiding Discussions About Health</h2><p>It’s so important that you discuss your health with your loved ones and your doctors. Avoiding these discussions may only make things worse, and your loved ones want nothing more than to help you. There are so many benefits that can come from having a support system in place; it can help you mentally and physically.</p><h2>Ignoring Financial Planning</h2><p>CNBC writes, “Being stressed about money is a common feeling—about 70% of Americans say that they’re stressed about money, according to CNBC’s Your Money Financial Confidence Survey. And one way that stress can manifest is avoidance.” There are many resources to help you with your finances, ensuring you have enough to last your retirement.</p><h2>Not Having a Purpose</h2><p>Feeling as though you don’t have a purpose can massively affect your mental health. It may stop you from doing things that you enjoy, such as seeing loved ones. Being in your 70s doesn’t mean that you can’t try out new hobbies or that you can’t find a purpose in life.</p><h2>Up Next: 18 Reasons Why Men Get Grumpier As They Age</h2><p>You might read this and be able to relate, or you may feel you’ve become grumpier the older you’ve gotten.
