    <main><h1>8 new uses for medical cannabis you may not know about</h1><h2>Seizures</h2><p>Seizures are sudden and uncontrolled electrical bursts within the brain, which notably cause falls, uncontrolled flailing and stiffening, loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing, staring or rapid blinking, and lack of control of other bodily functions.</p><p>CBD, in particular, has shown promise to help control seizures, reducing their frequency and severity. CBD is beneficial for conditions that are resistant to other treatments. In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved a CBD medication to treat seizures associated with a severe form of epilepsy.</p><figure><img title="Seizures" src="IMG/BB1ptK7X_seizures.jpg" alt="Seizures"><figcaption><em>Seizures. ldutko // Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Eating disorders</h2><p>Eating disorders, especially anorexia, can cause dangerously low levels of body fat, which impede many mental and physical functions. Studies on using cannabis as a treatment for eating disorders are limited, but some have shown that cannabis helped those with anorexia regain healthy weight and eased other symptoms of the disorder, such as stress.</p><p>Keep in mind that eating disorders and substance use disorders often occur in tandem, so those using marijuana for treatment should be cautious about using the drug.</p><figure><img title="Eating disorders" src="IMG/BB1ptwtx_eating_disorders.jpg" alt="Eating disorders"><figcaption><em>Eating disorders.

Cannabis can help target the underlying inflammation and symptoms of these incurable conditions.</p><p>Recent research shows that cannabis can calm inflammation and may even slow the overactive skin cell growth that causes dry patches. Cannabis and CBD products can also relieve pain, reduce itching, heal wounds, and manage stress (which often worsens these conditions).</p><figure><img title="Psoriasis and eczema" src="IMG/BB1ptF50_psoriasis_and_eczema.jpg" alt="Psoriasis and eczema"><figcaption><em>Psoriasis and eczema. Andrey_Popov // Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Arthritis</h2><p>Arthritis is another inflammatory disease that primarily attacks joints in the hands, hips, and knees. Marijuana can relieve the inflammation and pain associated with arthritis.</p><p>People who have tested CBD to treat their arthritis have also reported improved sleep and reduced anxiety. Some studies have shown cannabis could even slow or stop the progression of the disease, but more research must occur to confirm those early theories.</p><h2>Muscle spasticity</h2><p>Several medical conditions are primarily associated with muscle spasticity, or abnormal muscle tightness that prevents normal movement and causes involuntary muscle spasms and pain. These include multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.</p><p>The THC in marijuana can relax muscles and temper spasms. Cannabis can also relieve pain, reduce muscle and nerve inflammation, and improve sleep.</p><h2>Alzheimer's disease</h2><p>Alzheimer's—and dementia more broadly—affects millions of Americans each year, deteriorating parts of their brains associated with memory, reasoning, and other mental functions. Research is limited on the use of marijuana to treat these diseases.</p><p>Some studies have shown that high concentrations of CBD oil can relieve agitation and anxiety among Alzheimer's patients, significant behavioral symptoms associated with the disease.</p><h2>Crohn's disease</h2><p>Crohn's is characterized by digestive tract inflammation, which causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, reduced appetite, and weight loss.</p><p>As an anti-inflammatory, cannabis can reduce these symptoms. Some Crohn's patients report that cannabis has improved their quality of life by helping them manage pain, boost their appetites, and promote better sleep.</p><figure><img title="Crohn's disease" src="IMG/BB1ptAxU_crohns_disease.jpg" alt="Crohn's disease"><figcaption><em>Crohn's disease. Alex Ost // Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>PTSD</h2><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder can plague anyone who experiences or witnesses a traumatic event, including combat veterans, victims of abuse, and survivors of sexual assault. Those with PTSD may experience severe anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts concerning the trauma, and physical reactions to triggers.</p><p>A 2021 study in AIMS Neuroscience found that cannabis reduces symptoms of PTSD and improves patients' quality of life; the drug decreased nightmares, improved sleep, and alleviated their perpetual fight-or-flight response.</p><p>Researchers have identified marijuana as a therapeutic tool to treat symptoms of many other illnesses not covered here, such as endometriosis, and other forms of chronic pain and mental illnesses. Consult with medical professionals, conduct research, and tread carefully when deciding whether using cannabis to treat a medical condition is right for you.</p><p><em>Story editing by Alizah Salario.
