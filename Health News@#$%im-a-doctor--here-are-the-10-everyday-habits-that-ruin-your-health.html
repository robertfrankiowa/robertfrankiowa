Forgetting to breathe through your nose instead of your mouth.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These might seem like two innocuous and totally unrelated things - but they could be having a big impact on your health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Chris Boettcher is a physical therapist in South Carolina who has garnered a large social media following for his everyday health tips and weight loss advice.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drawing on recent research, he revealed the ten surprising habits that cause weight gain, ruin sleep and leave people less energetic.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Daily Mail" src="IMG/BB1pSznx_a_doctor_has_revealed_nine_daily_habits_that_he_says_are_undermining_health_stock.jpg" alt="A doctor has revealed nine daily habits that he says are undermining health (stock)"><figcaption><em>A doctor has revealed nine daily habits that he says are undermining health (stock). Provided by Daily Mail</em></figcaption></figure><p class="mol-para-with-font">Revealing his list online — already viewed by 700,000 people — he said: 'Health is simple.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'[Junk food companies have] just spent the past several decades moving your lifestyle, foods, and the information you consume as far away from simple as possible.'</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Drinking coffee first thing </h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">The first is drinking coffee too early.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The reason you reach for a cup of Joe so early is for the buzz, right? But Boettcher warned that caffeine is a diuretic which causes the body to lose water.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">In the morning, you're already dehydrated because you haven't consumed water for eight hours and you lose fluid when you sleep through sweat.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He advised having around four cups of water first before getting your coffee fix.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The USDA says men should drink 13 cups of water per day while women should drink 11 cups.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Emails in bed</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can be tempting to grab the phone first thing to check up on emails and notifications messages.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Boettcher warned against this, saying there was 'no worse way' to start the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Spend some time outside, preferably moving, before you check your devices,' he suggested.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts suggest that using phones early in the morning can trigger a stress response, causing therelease of cortisol in the body — affecting mood during the day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Studies have also suggested phones have a 'brain drain' effect, and reduce the amount of cognitive capacity people have when they are nearby.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Mouth breathing</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than half of Americans are thought to be 'mouth breathers', primarily breathing through their mouth instead of their noses.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mouth breathing can cause dry mouth because the constant flow of air in and out can cause water to evaporate, raising the risk of bacteria growth and then issues like tooth decay or infections.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can also impair sleep if the tongue rolls back in the mouth and blocks the airways, causing snoring and sleep apnea — interrupting healthy sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">To combat this, Boettcher recommended practicing 'mindfully breathing through your nose, and consider using tape while you sleep.'</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Hitting send before sleep</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">But experts warn against this, saying the blue light from phones can disrupt sleep and it can keep brains in an 'active' mode.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boettcher advises turning off all devices after 5pm, using do-not-disturb mode and scheduling this for every evening.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Using a phone before sleeping can cause pre-sleep hyperarousal, making it harder to fall asleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">It can also trigger stress, prompting the release of hormones like adrenaline — which also make it harder to shut off.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Eating cereals for breakfast</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Cereal companies love to remind us breakfast is the day's most important meal.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But cereals are often packed with refined carbohydrates and sugars, which can trigger rapid sugar spikes when consumed.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'It's why you feel chronically fatigued and hungry later in the day,' Boettcher said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Instead of cereals, he recommended a breakfast based on proteins and fats — such as one including eggs, oatmeal, berries and nuts.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Eating too little protein</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Doctors say eating protein is a great way to feel full for longer and lose weight.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And Boettcher is no exception to the rule, also recommending people focus on a high protein diet.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The USDA says people should eat 50 to 175 grams of protein every day.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boettcher urges everyone to aim for the top of this estimate — equivalent to nearly four steaks per day — to gain the health benefits.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We want protein to be at the heart of our diet for satiety, muscle growth and repair, and immune functionality,' he said.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Protein is the most satiating of the three macronutrients - carbs, fat and protein.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Sitting at a desk</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">More than eight in ten Americans work desk jobs, estimates suggest.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This can see them rooted to the same spot for upwards of eight hours a day, which can have negative effects on their health.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boettcher says staying at a desk for more than six hours raises the risk of numerous complications including poor posture, weight gain and an increased risk of chronic diseases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">And his assertion is backed up by studies, which found desk workers were 13 percent more likely to die from any cause than those who were not at desks.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boettcher said workers should try to move every hour by standing, stretching or walking to limit the negative health effects of the job.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Drinking sodas and juices</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Calorie-filled drinks are appealing, but it may be best to avoid them.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">One can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar — above the daily recommended intake for both men and women — while a glass of orange juice contains 25 grams.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Experts warn that because there is no fiber, this sugar is absorbed directly into the bloodstream — prompting a sugar spike. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Cutting liquid calories from juices, sodas and alcohol is a big lever to pull for weight loss and overall health,' Boettcher said.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Enjoying alcoholic beverages at dinner</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Many of us like to enjoy the odd glass of wine or a beer at dinner after a hard day at work.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But Boettcher warns against this, saying it can cause weight gain, anxiety and raises the risk of chronic diseases.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Drinking alcohol late in the day also raises the risk of sleep being disrupted, because it suppresses REM sleep — which is needed to help process memories from the day. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A pint of beer or glass of wine contains roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">With the liver breaking down alcohol roughly at a rate of 10 grams per hour, it can take up to two hours to remove just one of these drinks from the bloodstream.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'A few drinks a week won't kill you,' said Boettcher, 'but if it's everyday it might'.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox">Viewing bright light close to bedtime</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Another complication from viewing screens in bed is they can disrupt sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">These use blue light, which can inhibit the release of melatonin in the brain — which signals its time to sleep.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Boettcher recommends using blue light blockers or turning off screens an hour before bed to avoid this.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'We want to avoid this at all costs,' he says. </p></main>
