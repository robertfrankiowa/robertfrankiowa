    <main><h1>11 Superfoods You Want to Help Build Muscle and Lose Fat – and They're Not Just Protein</h1><h2>They include:</h2><ul>   <li>Disability</li>   <li>Loss of function</li>   <li>Frailty </li>   <li>Acute and chronic disease states like increased insulin resistance fall, fatigue, and mortality.</li>  </ul><h2>How to preserve muscle</h2><p>Muscle strength seems to be relatively well preserved until we hit 45 years old and then our muscle performance deteriorates by 5% every decade thereafter.Our body is constantly responding to the forces we put into it whether those forces are coming from sitting, sleeping,or exercising. Our bodies adapt to these forces in order to have a better ability to cope with them in the future. This means that if we are to sit for long periods of time like most of us do, then our bodies will adapt to that position making us even better at sitting. If we move around and exercise, then our bodies will adapt to that making us better capable of being able to handle excess loads in the future. One of the ways this happens is by building muscle so we can impart more force on external loads. Without the stimulus to create muscle then we will not build it, therefore having a well-thought-out exercise program is critical to success when it comes to building muscle.</p><h2>Nutrition and building muscle</h2><p>Our muscle is made up of protein and we need protein in order to build lean muscle mass; without protein, we are not able to build muscle. There are many great options available for protein including lean meats and vegetarian sources.  That being said, while protein is a major piece of the muscle-building puzzle it is not the whole picture; we need other nutrients in order to help us along our muscle-gaining journey. Below you will see a list of 10 nutrient-dense superfoods that are excellent at helping build muscle alongside protein.</p><figure><img title="Nutrition and building muscle" src="IMG/BB1kWNOo_nutrition_and_building_muscle.jpg" alt="Nutrition and building muscle"><figcaption><em>Nutrition and building muscle.

Beets also contain naturally occurring nitrates which are then converted to nitric oxide in the body which can boost muscle performance.</p><h2>Oysters</h2><p>Are extremely high in zinc which helps to promote testosterone production, which is vital for building muscle. They are also a good source of protein, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B12. </p><h2>Eggs</h2><p>Are a good source of protein, and the yolk also contains omega-3 fats that lowerinflammation and many nutrients including vitamin A, selenium, choline, vitamin B2, B5, B12, and vitamin D. Egg protein contains a complete range of amino acids and many nutrients helpful in building muscle. </p><h2>Sunflower seeds</h2><p>Are extremely high in vitamin E and copper along with a gamut of other nutrients. Anti-inflammatory Vitamin E is beneficial for joint health and can thereby aid workouts. Copper helps with proper oxygenation of tissues from red blood cells which is vital to muscle growth. Low levels of copper have been shown to cause growth problems. </p><h2>Sweet Potatoes</h2><p>Are extremely high in pro-vitamin A which is needed to help regulate testosterone production. Sweet potatoes are also a good carb source which can help replenish muscle energy stores (glycogen) for the next workout. </p><h2>Tahini</h2><p>Is made from sesame seeds and is very high in copper which is needed for proper muscle growth. It is also a good source of eight other minerals including zinc, manganese, magnesium, and calcium. Tahini is also a great vegetarian source of protein with 17g of protein per 100g.  </p><h2>Grass-fed beef</h2><p>The grass-fed is a very important part of this as grass-fed beef is much leaner and nutrient-dense than conventionally raised beef. Grass-fed beef has a good amount of omega-3 fatty acids which helps to lower inflammation, it is also a great source of iron which helps to transport oxygen around the body which is critical for energy production. The cherry on top is that grass-fed beef is also a wonderful source of protein. </p><h2>Sardines</h2><p>Are a great source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 plays a role in helping protein metabolism. As we know protein plays a major role in muscle growth so we need to be able to metabolize protein fully if we are going to use it effectively. </p><figure><img title="Sardines" src="IMG/BB1kWM1i_sardines.jpg" alt="Sardines"><figcaption><em>Sardines.

It is also a good source of protein with 20g per every 100g. Cacao also has a good amount of magnesium in it which is vital to muscle growth and performance during exercise. Magnesium is essential to the production of energy in the body as well as helping with the contraction process of tissues. </p><figure><img title="Cacao" src="IMG/BB1kWNPh_cacao.jpg" alt="Cacao"><figcaption><em>Cacao.

Calcium is necessary for the contraction of muscles while magnesium is necessary for relaxation, without sufficient levels of both we will not be able to have proper muscle function and therefore will lead to lower muscle gain. Kale is also a good source of fiber to feed the good bacteria in our guts. </p><figure><img title="Kale" src="IMG/BB1kWJFd_kale.jpg" alt="Kale"><figcaption><em>Kale.

Bone broth is easy to make and a great use of those bones instead of just throwing them away immediately. Bone broth is high in protein, and minerals which are both important for muscle growth. It is also a good source of collagen which is important for building strong connective tissue to help prevent injuries. Bone broth is also an excellent source of the amino acid glutamine which helps with muscle repair and is super amazing for healing the gut. If you can, drink 1 cup of bone broth a day.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Building muscle is vital for optimal health, we do this through proper nutrition and a good exercise program. When it comes to proper nutrition adequate protein intake plays a big role but we need other nutrients in order to support our muscle-building efforts and the ten superfoods listed above sure can help!</p></main>
