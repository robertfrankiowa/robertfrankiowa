Derived from the green, unripe coconuts of the coconut palm (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>), coconut water is the clear liquid found inside the fruit. This natural beverage has been consumed for centuries in tropical regions where coconuts flourish, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p><p>Thankfully, we can now find this tropical drink on store shelves all around the world. Whether enjoyed straight from the coconut or conveniently packaged in cartons or bottles, coconut water boasts an extraordinary nutrient profile and a wide array of health benefits, such as providing electrolytes and helping lower your blood pressure. This is why it has become an increasingly popular choice among individuals seeking a natural way to stay hydrated and nourished. Here’s what happens when you make this tropical beverage a regular part of your eating routine. </p><h2>Health Benefits of Coconut Water</h2><h3>May Replenish Electrolytes</h3><p>Coconut water, often dubbed “nature’s sports drink,” is packed with an impressive lineup of electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium. These minerals are essential for muscle contraction, nerve transmission and maintaining fluid balance throughout the body. Coconut water's electrolyte-rich profile makes it an excellent choice for rehydration, particularly following fluid and electrolyte loss from illness (like vomiting or diarrhea) or exercise-induced sweating, says Hannah Van Ark, M.S., RD, founder of Plant Forward Nutritionist. Remarkably, its osmotic composition resembles that of human plasma, making it an ideal beverage for replenishing electrolytes lost during dehydration.</p><h3>May Lower Blood Pressure</h3><p>Quenching your thirst with coconut water may positively impact your blood pressure thanks to its high potassium content. Potassium plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal blood pressure levels by relaxing blood vessel walls and counteracting the effects of sodium in the body. When sodium levels are too high, the body retains more water, which increases blood volume and raises blood pressure. Potassium steps in by encouraging the kidneys to excrete excess sodium, alleviating pressure on blood vessel walls. Fortunately, one cup of coconut water contains 404 mg (9% of the Daily Value) of this heart-healthy mineral, which Van Ark explains is similar to a medium-sized banana!</p><h3>May Support Bone Health</h3><p>While calcium and vitamin D are widely recognized for supporting bone health, some research shines a spotlight on potassium-rich foods and beverages—like coconut water—as vital allies in fortifying bone strength and density. This mighty mineral may be particularly beneficial in preventing osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weakened bones. Along with maintaining electrolyte balance and heart health, potassium also helps regulate acid-base balance in the body. When the body becomes too acidic, it leaches calcium from bones to help neutralize the excess acid, weakening bones over time. However, potassium can intervene by restoring acid-base balance and preventing calcium release from bone. Therefore, a diet rich in potassium is linked to higher bone mineral density, especially in older adults.</p><h3>May Improve Digestive Health</h3><p>Sipping coconut water may also enhance your gut health. This benefit primarily stems from coconut water’s hydrating properties. “Hydration is very important for proper digestive function, especially in the absorption of nutrients and for preventing constipation,” notes Van Ark. Research has also shown that coconut water has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties that can benefit the gut microbiome, which are the microbes that inhabit your intestines. A small study shows that coconut water has demonstrated the ability to help alleviate inflammation and possibly support remission in digestive disorders such as ulcerative colitis. As a result, coconut water may soothe irritated gut linings and offer relief from pangs of digestive distress.</p><h3>Might Reduce Cell Damage</h3><p>Each day, your cells face off against harmful molecules called free radicals. These molecules emerge from normal metabolic processes within your body and exposure to external toxins and pollutants. When the body is flooded with too many free radicals, it can lead to cell-damaging oxidative stress and a heightened risk of developing chronic diseases. Luckily, “antioxidants like vitamin C, cytokinins and phenolic compounds are present in coconut water, and these can fight free radical damage in the body,” Van Ark explains. However, she notes that the antioxidant effects of coconut water have only been researched in animals. Therefore, more human studies are needed to validate these findings and determine their effectiveness in people.</p><h3>Might Aid in Blood Sugar Management</h3><p>Drinking coconut water regularly may also support blood sugar regulation. Several animal studies have shown that coconut water may aid in managing diabetes by lowering blood sugar levels, improving insulin sensitivity and reducing oxidative stress. These beneficial effects are thought to be attributed to coconut water’s high antioxidant content, magnesium levels and the presence of an amino acid called L-arginine. However, it’s important to mention that while animal studies provide valuable insights, further human studies are needed to confirm these effects.</p><p>Additionally, some coconut water brands contain added sugar, which could result in blood sugar spikes. Still, coconut water is lower in sugar than many sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, says Van Ark. Therefore, she suggests that swapping these drinks for coconut water may reduce blood sugar levels for some individuals.</p><h3>Might Prevent Kidney Stones</h3><p>If you’ve ever passed a kidney stone, then you know how excruciatingly painful it can be. These stones are formed from crystallized minerals and salts that accumulate in the kidneys. The most common types of kidney stones include calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite and cystine stones. Although research is still in its early stages, Van Ark highlights that a small human study of eight participants revealed that coconut water may help prevent kidney stones by increasing the urinary output of citrate. This is good news because citrate is known for halting calcium stone formation. However, we need larger human studies to confirm these findings.</p><h2>Coconut Water Nutrition Facts</h2><p>The nutrition profile of coconut water varies depending on the age and variety of the coconut, along with how it is processed and stored. In general, this hydrating beverage is a great source of several key electrolytes, including potassium, sodium and magnesium. It also contains a trace amount of calcium. One cup (245 grams) of unsweetened coconut water contains:</p><ul><li><strong>Calories: </strong>44</li><li><strong>Total Carbohydrates: </strong>10 g</li><li><strong>Dietary Fiber: </strong>0 g</li><li><strong>Total Sugars: </strong>10 g*</li><li><strong>Protein: </strong><1 g</li><li><strong>Total Fat: </strong>0 g</li><li><strong>Saturated Fat: </strong>0 g</li><li><strong>Sodium: </strong>64 mg (3% DV)</li><li><strong>Potassium: </strong>404 mg (9% DV)</li><li><strong>Magnesium: </strong>15 mg (4% DV)</li><li><strong>Calcium: </strong>17 mg (1% DV)</li></ul><p><h2>Potential Downsides and Precautions</h2><p>Coconut water is not only a refreshing way to boost your health, but it’s also well-tolerated by most people, making it a safe choice for regular consumption. However, there are a few precautions to be aware of.</p><h3>Considerations for Kidney Disease</h3><p>Individuals with chronic kidney disease should seek guidance from their healthcare provider before adding coconut water to their diet. Coconut water is naturally high in potassium, which can pose challenges for those with compromised kidney function. While potassium is usually flushed out through urine, those with kidney issues may have difficulty eliminating excess potassium. Therefore, close monitoring of potassium intake is crucial to prevent complications.</p><h3>Precautions Regarding Surgery</h3><p>Similarly, if you have an upcoming surgery, avoiding coconut water for at least two weeks before and after the procedure is advisable. This is because coconut water can potentially affect blood pressure and blood sugar control during this critical period.</p><p>Consuming coconut water alongside anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic medications may cause blood pressure and blood sugar levels to drop too low. Therefore, people taking these medications should speak with their doctor before drinking coconut water on a regular basis.</p><h2>Best Ways to Enjoy Coconut Water</h2><p>When buying coconut water at the grocery store, check the nutrition facts label to ensure it closely mirrors the refreshing beverage you’d find on a tropical beach. Look for options that are free of added sugars and preservatives. Ideally, the ingredients list should contain only one item: pure coconut water. If you come across a brand with a unique pink hue, don’t fret! This is a good sign. When fresh coconut water is exposed to air, it undergoes reactions that turn the liquid pink. And, it’s a sign that it has retained many of its natural antioxidants.</p><p>Once you’ve picked the ideal coconut water, consider enjoying your refreshing beverage in the following ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Plain: </strong>A tall glass of coconut water over ice is the perfect way to cool down on a hot summer’s day. With its crisp taste and hydrating properties, coconut water is an electrolyte-rich beverage and a refreshing escape to paradise all in one.</li><li><strong>Smoothie:</strong> If you’re looking to add some fruit to the mix, consider blending coconut water into a delicious fruit smoothie. Try our Pineapple-Grapefruit Detox Smoothie or Acai-Blueberry Smoothie Bowl, both using coconut water as the base.</li><li><strong>Homemade Juice:</strong> Elevate your hydration game by making homemade juices infused with the natural sweetness of coconut water. Our Cucumber Juice and Ginger-Turmeric Carrot Shots are the perfect fridge essentials for a healthful pick-me-up.</li><li><strong>Frozen Ice Pop:</strong> A childhood classic with a healthy spin, ice pops made with coconut water and fruit are a delightful treat that combines nostalgia with nourishment. Toss berries, lemon juice, honey and coconut water (instead of plain water) into a blender and then into a popsicle mold to make our tasty Berry-Lemon Ice Pops.  </li><li><strong>Cocktails and Mocktails:</strong> On those days when you crave a cocktail (or mocktail), try adding coconut water to your favorite drink. If you need some inspiration, give our highly-rated Coconut Margarita a try. </li></ul><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Regularly consuming coconut water does more for your body than provide hydration. A daily cup of coconut water may help restore electrolyte balance, lower blood pressure levels, support bone health, improve digestive functioning and more. Whether you enjoy it plain, blended into a smoothie, mixed into a homemade juice or frozen into ice pops, incorporating coconut water into your diet offers a delicious and versatile way to reap its numerous health benefits.
