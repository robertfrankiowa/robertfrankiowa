These Pals will fight alongside you, work at your behest, all in the name of supporting your journey in Palworld. However, these innocent little guys are not invincible. In fact, Pals are quite vulnerable and will often need your care in order to be the best that they can be.</p><p>One such vulnerability is the existence of medical ailments and conditions. These debuffs will significantly decrease a Pal’s work productivity and viability in combat, so it is important to treat them as soon as possible. There’s nothing worse than an unproductive, unprotected base, so let’s get right into it.</p><h2>      All Medicines and How to Make Them    </h2><table>            <tr>                          <th>          <p>Medicine</p>    </th>                          <th>          <p>Picture</p>    </th>                          <th>          <p>Level Unlocked</p>    </th>                          <th>          <p>Recipe</p>    </th>  </tr>            <tr>        <td>          <p>Low Grade Medical Supplies</p>    </td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <td>          <p>Level 12</p>    </td>        <td>      <ul>          <li>            5 x Red Berries      </li>          <li>            2 x Horn      </li>                         </ul>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>          <p>Medical Supplies</p>    </td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <td>          <p>Level 12</p>    </td>        <td>      <ul>          <li>            3 x Ingot      </li>          <li>            3 x Horn      </li>          <li>            1 x Bone      </li>                         </ul>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>          <p>High Grade Medical Supplies</p>    </td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <td>          <p>Level 12</p>    </td>        <td>      <ul>          <li>            5 x Ingot      </li>          <li>            5 x Horn      </li>          <li>            2 x Bone      </li>                         </ul>  </td>  </tr>      </table><p>The medical supplies will require a significant amount of horn and bone stores. You should consider stockpiling on these items early so you do not have to worry about having them or not when your Pals get sick. We have a couple of guides to make your life easier when it comes to this! Here they are for your ease:</p><h5 class="display-card-title ">Palworld: Best Way to Farm Bones</h5><h5 class="display-card-title ">Palworld: Best Way to Farm Horns</h5><p>You should consider having around 5 of each type of medicine on hand at all times. They don't expire, so you can just keep them forever. This will help you out if your Pals all decide to come down with some ailment all at once - something that has happened to me a couple of times. When it rains, it pours.</p><h2>      All Medical Ailments and Conditions    </h2><p>Below is a list of all medical conditions to keep an eye out for in the game.</p><table>            <tr>                          <th>          <p>Status</p>    </th>                          <th>          <p>Causes and Symptoms</p>    </th>                          <th>          <p>How to Treat</p>    </th>  </tr>            <tr>        <td>          <p>Colds</p>    </td>        <td>          <p>This conditions seem to happen randomly, and is easy to fix.

This condition will eventually degrade to the Minor Injury condition.</p>    </td>  </tr>      </table><h2>      Stats To Keep In Mind    </h2><h3>Nutrition and Hunger</h3><p>Hunger is easy to see, and is the root of all status problems. The tricky part with hunger, however, is that it is more complicated than just making sure that your Pals eat. Your Pals may not be getting the best value from their food that they can - which is especially true if you are only feeding your Pals <strong>Red Berries</strong>, as many Pal Tamers tend to do as this food is the easiest to produce on a base.</p><p>Many of the conditions in this game can be addressed before they even happen by improving the food that you give to your Pals to begin with. Palworld has a hidden value for nutrition, and there is no known way to track this value or whether it is the same or different for every Pal. What we do know about this value is that the higher it is, the more likely your Pals are going to stay healthy and not develop any conditions whatsoever.</p><p>Food that is highly nutritious and easy to produce will, therefore, be incredibly important. This becomes especially true the later in the game you get. We want to pick foods with high nutritional values, while also keeping in mind that we do not want to be using ingredients that could be used for making Cakes. Cakes are essential for breeding, and if you want overpowered Pals, you will need a ton of Cake. Avoid recipes that use Red Berries, Eggs, Flour, Honey, and Milk. </p><p>The best food you can use will be <strong>Salads</strong>. Salads only require <strong>Tomatos</strong> and <strong>Lettuce</strong>, making them ideal for avoiding the use of Cake recipe materials. These are also high value in terms of nutrition, giving you a best-of-both-worlds solution.</p><h3>Passives To Watch For</h3><p>Some Pals have Passive Skills that make them ideal, or unideal, for work at the base. Here is a list of all passives to keep an eye on:</p><table>            <tr>        <td>          <p>Passives</p>    </td>        <td>          <p>Effects</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>          <p>Artisan, Serious, Lucky, Work Slave</p>    </td>        <td>          <p>These increase work speed (but not grazing speed).</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>          <p>Diet Lover, Dainty Eater</p>    </td>        <td>          <p>Hunger levels will drop more slowly. Pals with this do not eat as often.</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>          <p>Workaholic, Positive Thinker</p>    </td>        <td>          <p>Sanity level drops slower. Pals with this will not take a break as often as others.</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>          <p>Swift, Runner, Nimble</p>    </td>        <td>          <p>Increased movement speed. Pals with this will zip back and forth between jobs and feeding, which is ideal as most of a base's wasted time is spent traveling.</p>    </td>  </tr>      </table></main>
