    <main><h1>5 Exercises To Get A Smaller Waist</h1><p>Having a smaller waist-to-hip-to-bust ratio is a classic representation of youth and femininity. As we age, many of us begin to lose that hourglass figure. The bust begins to droop, fat cells are deposited in and around the waistline, and the bottom starts to sag. With these three significant physique changes that happen as we age, the waistline seems to all but disappear.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The First Step To A Smaller Waist Is Healthy Nutrition</h2><p>Our Prime Women article about the fastest way to reduce belly fat states that too much of any kind of fat is bad for us, but belly fat can be especially dangerous. The visceral fat in the belly, which lies beneath the abdominal muscles, can cause health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and breathing problems.</p><p>Remember that you cannot spot-reduce fat by doing certain exercises, so it is essential that you reduce your overall body fat by choosing a healthy nutrition plan and incorporating an exercise or walking routine that will help you burn excess calories. We will be covering specific exercises you can do routinely to train the waistline, but incorporating a walking routine can also help you achieve weight loss and overall wellness.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeted Exercises Can Create The Appearance Of A Smaller Waist</h2><p>Because the size and shape of both the bustline and booty have such an effect on the appearance of the waist, it is necessary to train all three of these key areas, including the chest, butt, and core. It is especially important to train the butt, as the growth in the gluteus muscles and the lift that you will get in the booty will create a bigger differential between the butt, hips, and waistline. A perkier butt will give the appearance of a smaller waist!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 Abdominal And Core Exercises For A Smaller Waist</h2><p>The core muscles aren’t just made up of the abs or the “six-pack.” They are the muscles deep within the abdominals and back, attaching to the spine or pelvis. Some of these muscles include the abdominals and the obliques, which are the ones we commonly think of when we consider waist training or focusing on tightening and reducing the appearance of the midsection.</p><p>The abs and obliques are essential for bending and twisting – but even more crucial for a solid center (and this is important) are those thick muscles that wrap around your torso and act like a girdle, keeping your core tight and aligned. Training your abdominal and core muscles offers a huge benefit not only in appearance but also in strength, movement, and stability. Here are three great exercises to work your abdominal and core muscles to tighten your waist.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">High Plank</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Prime Women Media" src="IMG/BB1l5fg7_exercises_for_a_smaller_waist_woman_doing_planks.jpg" alt="Exercises for a smaller waist woman doing planks"><figcaption><em>Exercises for a smaller waist woman doing planks. Provided by Prime Women Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>While the plank is an exercise that trains your body from head to toe, it also helps strengthen your core muscles, including your abdominals and lower back. The plank is a simple and effective bodyweight exercise that can be done anywhere and easily incorporated into your daily routine. It will also be easy to move from the plank position into a number of other exercises to train your waist and core at the same time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to do a plank:</strong></h3><ul> <li>Start on all fours with hands stacked directly under shoulders and knees bent and stacked directly under hips.</li>    <li>Step one leg back at a time to come into a high plank position on palms, actively squeezing heels and glutes together and drawing the navel to the spine.</li>    <li>Hold for 15 to 30 seconds.</li>    <li>Repeat.</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Plank Shoulder Taps</h2><p>While you’re in the high plank position (described above), adding shoulder taps is the next simple step in your smaller waist routine. The plank with shoulder taps strengthens your core and glutes, contributing to a smaller waistline. An added benefit is that you can work your arms and shoulders at the same time. Like the high plank, this exercise will help reduce lower back pain, improve posture, and tighten your midsection.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to do a plank with shoulder taps:</strong></h3><ul> <li>Start on all fours with hands stacked directly under shoulders and knees bent and stacked directly under hips.</li>    <li>Step one leg back at a time to come into a high plank position on palms, actively squeezing heels and glutes together and drawing the navel to the spine.</li>    <li>Lift one arm off the ground, tap the opposite shoulder, and return that hand to its original position on the palms.</li>    <li>Repeat on the other side.</li>    <li>Continue alternating between sides for 20 to 30 repetitions.</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vacuum Twists (the holy grail of ab exercises)</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Prime Women Media" src="IMG/BB1l5jBR_vacuum_twists_heidi_powell_abs_workout.jpg" alt="Vacuum Twists Heidi Powell Abs Workout"><figcaption><em>Vacuum Twists Heidi Powell Abs Workout. Provided by Prime Women Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>It might be a funny name, but it is touted as the number one exercise that will change your abs and core, flatten your belly, and just might change your life. Vacuum twists help to strengthen and work the deepest ab muscles we have and can also improve your posture.</p><p>If you choose just one ab exercise that will help you achieve a smaller waist, the vacuum twist is the one. It is possibly the holy grail of an ab or waist exercise and can be done as a routine part of your day. Try incorporating this into your morning routine as part of getting ready for the day or while you’re standing in the kitchen waiting on a timer.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to do vacuum twists:</strong></h3><ul> <li>Stand up, have good posture, and inhale.</li>    <li>Exhale all the air out, and at the bottom of the exhale, draw in. This is NOT sucking in your “stomach.” Draw in from the bottom up. Use those lower muscles.</li>    <li>Put your arms up with your hands somewhat behind your head while holding the squeezing position.</li>    <li>Twist from side to side.</li>    <li>Then exhale.</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Achieve The Appearance Of A Smaller Waist By Exercising The Glutes</h2><p>There are many physical benefits to growing and strengthening your glutes. Your glutes (your butt) are the primary mobilizers of hips and thighs. Even though we’re working on growing and rounding the butt muscle in this instance for aesthetic reasons, you can be assured that working the glutes has major health benefits that are especially important as we age. Here are two great glute exercises that you can do at home.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fire Hydrants</h2><ul> <li>Start on your hands and knees. Your knees should be touching, and your hands should be shoulder-width apart and directly below your shoulders.</li>    <li>Keep your back straight and look directly towards the floor at all times.</li>    <li>Lift one leg up and away from your body at a 45-degree angle, keep your knee positioned at 90 degrees, and try to lift it until aligned with your hips.</li>    <li>Slowly lower it back to the starting position and repeat on the other side.</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Squats</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to do a Squat:</strong></h3><ul> <li>Stand with feet between hip and shoulder-width distance apart, and your toes turned slightly out.</li>    <li>Your spine should be neutral.</li>    <li>Shoulders back and chest open.</li>    <li>Make sure you keep heals down and keep them planted throughout the move.</li>    <li>Initiate the movement by sending the hips back as if you’re sitting back in an invisible chair.</li>    <li>Bend knees to lower down as far as possible with chest lifted in a controlled movement.</li>    <li>Keep lower back neutral.</li>    <li>Press through heels to stand back up to the starting position.</li>    <li>Repeat.</li> </ul><p>Combining these simple exercises into your daily routine will have you on your way to a smaller, firmer waist and midsection in no time. Even the simplest movements, done consistently, will make the most difference over time. Extreme diets, long workouts, or risk injury with heavy weights are unnecessary, and it’s most important to focus on what you are willing to reasonably create time for as part of your daily routine.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Prime Women Media" src="IMG/BB1kTv8L_on_womens_cloud_x_3_ad_shoes_14995.jpg" alt="On Women's Cloud X 3 AD Shoes, $149.95"><figcaption><em>On Women’s Cloud X 3 AD Shoes, $149.95.
