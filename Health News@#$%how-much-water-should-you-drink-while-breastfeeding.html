    <main><h1>How Much Water Should You Drink While Breastfeeding?</h1><p><p>Experts recommend drinking 16 cups of water a day while breastfeeding. Learn why staying hydrated is so important while breastfeeding and how to meet that goal.</p><strong>Medically reviewed by Alyssa Dweck, MS, MD, FACOG</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Alyssa Dweck, MS, MD, FACOG</strong><p>You probably heard how important it is to stay hydrated while pregnant. If you choose to breastfeed, the situation is the same. When you're breastfeeding, you are hydrating your baby and yourself, so it's important to know how much water to drink. Experts recommend drinking about 16 cups (128 ounces) of water per day as a breastfeeding parent.</p><p>128 ounces sounds like a lot. That comes out to 16 8-ounce cups of water. But 8 ounces is a small serving size once you measure it out in a glass. If you drink a large glass of water each time you breastfeed, as well as with meals, you should be able to hit that 16-cup goal without any issues.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Parents" src="IMG/BB1plEK6_parent_breastfeeding_baby.jpg" alt="Parent breastfeeding baby"><figcaption><em>kate_sept2004 / Getty Images.

However, research on the effect of extra fluid on milk production, supply, and infant growth hasn't shown that drinking more than your usual amount of fluids will increase milk supply. So, there is no reason to think that staying well hydrated while breastfeeding, while it might good for your health, will give you a boost in milk production. Simply drink enough to stay adequately hydrated.</p><p>On the other hand, getting too little liquid can cause you to become dehydrated, which can negatively impact your health and breast milk. It is important to make sure you are getting plenty of fluids so that your body is able to function at its optimal level.</p><h2>Avoiding Dehydration</h2><p>Rather than focusing on meeting a goal of a set number of ounces, the key is to make sure you don't become dehydrated. Staying hydrated by getting plenty of water and other fluids throughout the day is vital to your health, no matter what stage of life you're in.</p><p><h3>Symptoms of Dehydration</h3><p>If you don't get enough water and other fluids, you risk becoming dehydrated, which can lead to some unpleasant symptoms, such as:</p><ul><li>Constipation</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Dry mouth and chapped lips</li><li>Fatigue and a lack of energy</li><li>Headache</li><li>Moodiness</li><li>Muscle cramps</li><li>Nausea</li></ul><p> <h2>How To Get Enough Fluids</h2><p>Your top indicator of whether you need more fluids is thirst. A good rule of thumb is to drink enough water so that you're not thirsty, otherwise known as drinking to thirst.</p><p>Thirst is your body's way of telling you that you need to drink more, so do your best to pay attention to it. By the time you're physically craving water, your body is already depleted of fluid. Soon after starting to nurse, you will notice that you feel thirsty more often.</p><p>This desire to drink more water while nursing is triggered by oxytocin, a hormone released during breastfeeding. Oxytocin is one of the pregnancy and postpartum hormones which naturally affects your thirst cues to encourage you to drink enough water to hydrate yourself and make breast milk.</p><p>The color and amount of your urine is a telling clue about your level of hydration. If your urine is dark, it isn't being diluted enough by what you drink. Look for a pale yellow or almost clear color which indicates you're getting enough fluids.</p><h2>Almost All Liquids Count Toward Hydration</h2><p>Your fluids don't have to all come from water, but it's always a good choice. Plus, you can easily flavor your water with fruits or herbs when you want a change.</p><p>That said, any liquids you consume, along with any water-rich foods you eat, contribute to your overall fluid intake. Some examples of drinks that contribute to your fluid intake include cow's milk or nut milk, decaffeinated coffee or tea, and fruit or vegetable juice. Foods, such as oranges, watermelon, berries, soup, cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce can help keep you hydrated, too.</p><p>If you don't care for cow's milk, don't worry. You don't need it in your diet to make breast milk. Just be sure you are getting calcium from other sources, such as cheese, yogurt, green leafy vegetables, or calcium-fortified foods.</p><p>Because newborns breastfeed about 8 to 12 times a day, having a large glass of water before or after every feeding is a good way to get your daily quota without having to think about it.</p><p>Know, however, that consuming too much fluid (or having colorless urine) can actually harm your milk supply. Over hydrating can cause an imbalance in your electrolytes, which can sometimes lead to fatigue or muscle cramping.</p><h2>Drinks To Limit When Breastfeeding</h2><p>It's true that you'll need to take in extra calories to support milk production while you're nursing, but those calories should come from foods and beverages that are nutrient-dense. Experts recommend that you avoid or limit the following liquids when nursing.</p><h3>Sugary sodas and fruit drinks</h3><p>Beverages that contain a lot of sugar, such as soda, can reduce the amount of fluid that your body actually retains. This can further exacerbate dehydration, causing heat stress and putting pressure on the kidneys, according to a study that examined the effects of such beverages. The same can be said of fruit drinks that are high in sugar but low in fiber.</p><p>If you're really craving a sweet drink, try adding fruits and berries to your water. If you are still missing that sweetness, you are better off adding 1 teaspoon of plain table sugar to your fruit-infused water than drinking a can of soda, which has about 9.5 teaspoons of sugar per can.</p><p>Despite the name, fruit drinks often contain little or no actual fruit juice. These are the products often labeled as "drinks," "coolers," or "punches." These are different from 100% fruit juice, which is still a good choice for hydration.</p><h3>Caffeinated drinks</h3><p>Caffeine can pass into breast milk and affect your baby's mood and sleep. It is also a diuretic, which means it causes you to lose fluid. Caffeine can have a dehydrating effect on your body.</p><h3>Alcohol</h3><p>There are many misconceptions regarding alcohol and breastfeeding. The CDC recommends abstaining from alcohol as the safest option while breastfeeding, however the organization also points out that "moderate alcohol consumption, meaning up to one standard drink in a day, is not known to be harmful to the infant." Per CDC guidance, it's best to wait two hours after drinking before nursing.</p><p>One reason to abstain: Alcohol is more likely to inhibit the letdown reflex.</p><p>If you're in the mood for a cocktail, you might try adding a splash of no-sugar-added fruit juice to plain seltzer in a champagne flute instead.</p><p>Here is what to remember about staying hydrated while breastfeeding:</p><ul><li><strong>6 cups is the average amount needed per day.</strong> How much water you need to drink while breastfeeding varies per individual. You may need more than the recommended 128 ounces a day—especially in hot weather or if you are more active than the average person.</li><li><strong>Urine should be pale yellow.</strong> Check your urine color to determine if you are drinking the right amount of water for you. You are adequately hydrated if your urine is pale yellow. Anything darker indicates that you are dehydrated.</li><li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Try to avoid getting thirsty. Feeling thirsty indicates that your body is already slightly dehydrated. If you have questions about your hydration needs while breastfeeding, talk to a health care provider or a lactation consultant.</li></ul>
