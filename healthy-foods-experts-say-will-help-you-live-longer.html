    <main><h1>Healthy Foods Experts Say Will Help You Live Longer</h1><h2>Eat more: unrefined carbohydrates</h2><p>A recent study by the University of Southern California has looked into ways we can live a longer and healthier life. Called the “longevity diet”, there are a few key findings from the report. We all know carbohydrates are our main source of energy, but when it comes to longevity, we need to look to unrefined carbohydrates. That includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes. They all release their energy slowly, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels.</p><h2>Eat more: plant-based protein</h2><p>The “longevity diet” also suggests we should limit animal-based protein and switch to plant-based options. If you’re wondering how to get protein from plant-based sources, increase the amount of lentils, chickpeas, beans, mushrooms, spinach, beansprouts, sweetcorn, broccoli, asparagus and Brussels sprouts you eat. Try using plant-based protein in place of meat in some of your favorite dishes. In most cases you won’t even know the difference.</p><p><strong>Get the recipe for a quick lentil ratatouille here</strong></p><figure><img title="Eat more: plant-based protein" src="IMG/BB1hcTIN_eat_more_plant_based_protein.jpg" alt="Eat more: plant-based protein"><figcaption><em>Eat more: plant-based protein.

Try cooking with rapeseed oil and using extra virgin olive oil in your salad dressings for starters.</p><p><strong>Get the recipe for grilled avocado salad with tahini dressing here</strong></p><h2>Fasting: think about meal times</h2><p>The “longevity diet” report also suggests the day’s meals should be eaten within an 11-12 hour window, which would allow for a daily period of fasting. On top of that, a five-day cycle of fasting every three-four months could apparently help to reduce insulin resistance, blood pressure and other possible health issues.</p><h2>Avoiding ultra-processed foods may be key</h2><p>A 2019 JAMA Internal Medicine study involving nearly 45,000 people aged 45 or older reported a statistically significant correlation between the intake of ultra-processed food and the risk of early death from all causes. The definition of ultra-processed food includes ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially-produced foods, often with flavor enhancers and colors that make food more desirable and moreish.</p><h2>Plant-based or meat?</h2><p>That “avoid ultra-processed” rule extends to vegan diets too, which aren’t all healthy. A 2017 study found that a largely plant-based diet made up of whole foods was linked with the lowest level of heart disease risk. Next came a healthy omnivorous diet, while worst for the heart was a near vegan diet where refined grains, chips, fries, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices featured heavily.</p><h2>Eat less: donuts</h2><p>There’s no sugar coating it: donuts are squarely in the unhealthy, ultra-processed camp, combining sugar and fat in a duo that is oh-so-hard to resist. One Krispy Kreme glazed raspberry donut contains 0.2oz (6g) of saturated fat – around a third of the recommended daily limit of this cholesterol-raising fat type – along with 310 calories and about 5 teaspoons of sugar.</p><h2>Eat less: fried potatoes</h2><p>Eating fries more than twice a week was associated with a more than doubled risk of death in a 2017 study. However there’s a nugget of hope here: the study was carried out in a US population before trans fats (the type of fat that’s most likely to contribute to cardiovascular disease) was banned in cooking oils. So, a plate of fries – though still bad news for your waistline – might not be quite as bad for your heart any longer.</p><figure><img title="Eat less: fried potatoes" src="IMG/BB1hcTId_eat_less_fried_potatoes.jpg" alt="Eat less: fried potatoes"><figcaption><em>Eat less: fried potatoes. abc1234/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Eat more: leafy greens</h2><p>Eating more (non-potato) vegetables in general correlates with better health outcomes and increased longevity. But this 2017 study in the <em>International Journal of Epidemiology</em> picks out leafy greens (for example, spinach, broccoli and kale), salads and cruciferous (cabbage family) veg as specifically linked with reduced cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Cruciferous veg were also linked with a lower total cancer risk.</p><p><strong>Liking this?

The risk of all-cause mortality decreased by 16% when intake of pulses increased to 5oz (150g) a day – that’s between half and two-thirds of a can of drained beans.</p><p><strong>Need inspiration?

Acrylamide – formed when carbohydrate-containing foods are toasted, roasted, baked, fried or grilled – is linked with cancer in animals and may be carcinogenic to humans too. As a precaution, the FSA says to only cook toast, roast potatoes and oven chips until lightly golden, not dark brown.</p><h2>Eat less: flame-grilled and pan-fried meats</h2><p>Heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are carcinogenic chemicals formed when proteins such as steak, chicken and fish are grilled over flames or cooked on a hot metal surface (in a frying pan for example). Cut your risk by not charring the outside of your meat, turning it often or part microwaving first.</p><h2>Eat more: fruit</h2><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates-funded study also suggested that 82 million deaths globally could be attributed to a low intake of fruit. The risk of all-cause mortality decreased by approximately 10% when fruit consumption was around 8.8oz (250g) a day – about three small portions. But there was no extra benefit recorded beyond that, so there's no need to keep scoffing it.</p><h2>Eat more: blueberries and other berries</h2><p>The American Institute of Cancer Research says all berries contain a range of anti-cancer components, but blueberries are particularly rich in anthocyanosides, which are potent antioxidants. Concentrated blueberry extracts also help improve brain function in older people, according to research.</p><p><strong>These are the best foods and drinks to help you sleep</strong></p><h2>Eat less: ham, bacon and salami</h2><p>Studies show that processed meats are linked with colon cancer. Unhealthy ingredients in bacon, ham and other cured meats include high levels of salt and nitrite preservatives – some scientists have even called for a ban on processing nitrates, because they convert to carcinogenic nitrosamines (a type of chemical compound) in the stomach.</p><h2>Eat less: hot dogs</h2><p>Next time you're craving a hot dog, consider if you want one enough to lose 36 minutes of your life. That's how much this processed food shortens the average person's life by, according to Michigan University scientists who looked at the impact of over 5,800 foods on longevity. Hot dogs curtail life expectancy because of their high levels of salt, saturated fats and preservatives.</p><h2>Eat less: salt</h2><p>According to a study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, excess salt intake was responsible for three million deaths globally in 2017. The UK’s Action on Salt campaign says high salt intake causes high blood pressure, leading to strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Bread, cereal, soup, sauces, pizzas and meat products can all be high in salt, so compare labels and look for lower-salt versions.</p><h2>Drink less: sugary drinks</h2><p>You’re racking up more than the UK recommended amount of sugar (30g/1oz) in one go when you sink a full-sugar can of Coca-Cola (a 330ml/11fl oz can has 139 calories and 35g/1.2oz of added sugar). A 2017 study linked just one daily glass of sweetened beverages with a 7% increased mortality risk.</p><p><strong>Check out these easy ways to cut down on sugar</strong></p><h2>Drink less: alcohol</h2><p>There were 8,974 alcohol-specific deaths in the UK during 2020 according to the NHS (National Health Service). And booze is also a factor in several cancers, including breast, mouth and esophageal cancer. Fourteen units per week (equivalent to just over a bottle of 14% ABV/28 proof wine) is the UK maximum recommended intake for both men and women, and is a good rule of thumb wherever you live in the world.</p><h2>Eat more: spicy food</h2><p>Here’s some good news for fans of hot sauce. A study of nearly 500,000 people in China found those who ate spicy food six days per week were 14% less likely to die early than those who consumed it less than once a week. Fiery foods may also give your metabolism a temporary boost – and every little helps when you're trying to maintain a healthy weight.</p><h2>Eat more: high fiber whole grains</h2><p>In 2019, a World Health Organization-funded study reported a 15-30% reduction in death rate in those eating the most, compared with the least, fiber. Eating fiber-rich foods, including wholewheat bread, wholewheat pasta, quinoa, brown rice and other whole grains also correlated with a 16-24% reduced incidence of coronary heart disease, strokes, Type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer.</p><figure><img title="Eat more: high fiber whole grains" src="IMG/BB1hcOY1_eat_more_high_fiber_whole_grains.jpg" alt="Eat more: high fiber whole grains"><figcaption><em>Eat more: high fiber whole grains. Krzysztof Slusarczyk/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Eat more: nuts (a handful daily)</h2><p>A pile of studies, including this one, have linked regular nut consumption with a lower risk of heart disease and of dying from any cause – this includes peanuts and tree nuts (almonds, walnuts and cashews, for example). Around one small handful, at least three times per week, seems to be all that’s needed. Remember, though, that most nuts have about 150-200 calories per handful, so you don’t want to overdo it.</p><figure><img title="Eat more: nuts (a handful daily)" src="IMG/BB1hcRSi_eat_more_nuts_a_handful_daily.jpg" alt="Eat more: nuts (a handful daily)"><figcaption><em>Eat more: nuts (a handful daily). nehophoto/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Eat more: peanut butter and jam sandwiches</h2><p>Nuts are so good for us that even that classic US comfort food – a peanut butter and jam sandwich – can contribute to longer life. A Michigan University study calculated that eating a PB&J sandwich added 33 minutes to a person's life. Use wholewheat bread for extra health benefits.</p><p><strong>Discover more surprisingly healthy foods</strong></p><h2>Eat more: fish rich in omega-3 oil</h2><p>Results from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (published here) show that men and women who consumed the most omega-3 reaped a 15% and 18% reduction in cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Eating fish in general correlated with a lower death risk, but only when it wasn't fried.</p><p><strong>Check out our favourite salmon recipes here</strong></p><h2>A sweet spot for carb intake</h2><p>We’ve gone a little low-carb crazy lately, but a study in <em>The Lancet Public Health</em> journal found that both low and high-carbohydrate diets are linked with an increase in mortality, while moderate consumers of carbohydrates had the lowest risk. As a rough guide, making about a quarter of your meal a healthy carb (wholegrains, for example) is about right.</p><h2>Just the right amount of dairy</h2><p>The <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> study says getting a maximum of 26oz (750g) of dairy – about two big glasses of milk and a small pot of yogurt daily – is not harmful, and indeed dairy consumption provides calcium and is linked with lower colorectal cancer risk. But large intakes of 35oz (1,000g) daily or more were associated with a 15% increased risk of mortality in this study.</p><p><strong>Liked this?
