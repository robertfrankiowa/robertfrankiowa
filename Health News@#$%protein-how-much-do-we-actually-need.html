Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve been in a grocery store or browsing food blogs lately, you’ve probably noticed how many food items and recipes are boasting about being high in protein. Not only are prepackaged foods like cereals and pancake mixes upping their protein, but protein powders and bars are growing more popular as well. While protein is an important nutrient for a healthy diet, how much of it do we actually need?</p><h2>The Role of Protein in Our Bodies</h2><p>Before we jump into the research on how much protein to consume, let’s quickly review why protein deserves all of this attention. While there are many functions of protein in the body, here are the major ones:</p><ul>  <li>Build and repair muscles and tissues</li>  <li>Regulate digestion and your metabolism</li>  <li>Regulate hormone levels and actions necessary for growth and development</li>  <li>Make up antibodies, which are major components of the immune system</li>  <li>Provide cell structure, which is key for strong and healthy skin, nails, and hair.</li> </ul><h1>Quiz: What’s Your Protein IQ?</h1><p>It’s hard to overstate the importance of protein in a healthy diet. After all, it’s not called “the building blocks of life” for nothing.</p><p>“Protein helps keep our muscles healthy, which then helps improve our body composition and limits cravings,” says Dawn Jackson-Blatner, RDN, the Chicago-based author of <em>The Flexitarian Diet</em> and <em>The Superfood Swap</em>. “It’s also important for blood sugar, immunity, mental clarity, and metabolic health.” All in all, she adds, “It’s a pretty big deal.”</p><p>Plus, the more you know about protein, the better you’ll be able to use it in your diet. Here are 10 questions that will put your protein knowledge to the test.</p><h2>Recommended Daily Allowance</h2><p>To sum it up, protein is pretty darn important. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams (g) per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day. So, for example, an adult weighing 150 pounds (68 kg) needs about 55 g of protein per day (equivalent to just 6 ounces of meat or chicken!). However, there’s a common misconception that the RDA is the exact amount we should consume.</p><p>In fact, the RDA is defined as “the average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group,” as noted in <em>The American Journal for Clinical Nutrition</em>. This means the current recommendation of 0.8 g of protein per kg of body weight per day is more of a <em>minimum</em> amount of protein that the body needs to perform its basic functions. The exact amount of protein an individual needs varies greatly depending on their activity level, any illnesses or injuries, and age.</p><p>Recent research studies have shown higher amounts of protein to possibly be beneficial for muscle mass and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. One review suggests that daily protein intake of 1 g to 1.2 g per kg of body weight per day is beneficial for muscle strength and growth in the short term. Other studies have shown an intake of closer to 1.6 g per kg of body weight per day to maximize muscle growth in active young adults.</p><p>In addition to total daily protein needs, studies are also looking at protein intake throughout the day, with many finding favorable results when protein intake is evenly distributed between meals, according to research.</p><h2>How Much Protein Do We Actually Need?</h2><p>So, what do we do with all this data? The USDA currently recommends that 10 percent to 35 percent of our calories come from protein, with highly active individuals on the higher end of protein intake. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics gets a little more specific, with general guidelines of 1.1 g to 1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight per day for individuals who are regularly active.</p><p>For endurance athletes, such as marathon runners, the current recommendation is a large range of 1.2 g to 2 g per kg of body weight per day, depending on the training schedule and length of runs.</p><p>Finally, for serious weight lifters, protein recommendations fall between 1.4 g to 2 g per kg of body weight per day. </p><p>The key here is that it’s all about personal needs and goals — unfortunately there’s no one-size-fits-all recommendation when it comes to protein needs.</p><p><em>Quick hint: <strong>Lose It!

Plant-based foods like beans, legumes, nuts, whole soy (such as edamame, tofu, and soy milk), and quinoa are especially good, as these foods are rich in important vitamins and minerals while also being lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than many animal protein sources.</p><p>For a longer list of healthy protein options, check out our article on the power of protein.</p><h2>Am I Consuming Too Much Protein?</h2><p>Can we consume too much protein? The answer is yes. On a physiological level, our bodies can only absorb so much protein at any one time. Our bodies also can’t store protein, so any extra protein we consume gets turned into either glucose (sugar) or triglycerides (fat) to be used immediately for energy or stored for later energy needs.</p><p>While previous research suggests that the average human body can only process 20 g to 25 g of protein at any one time, more recent studies are finding that healthy, active adults may be able to absorb closer to 27 g per meal.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>While the research into exactly how much protein we all need is still mixed and ongoing, the takeaway message is balance. Incorporating protein throughout the day is a key part of a healthy diet, but it’s also important to stay mindful of portion sizes and the type of protein sources you’re eating.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
