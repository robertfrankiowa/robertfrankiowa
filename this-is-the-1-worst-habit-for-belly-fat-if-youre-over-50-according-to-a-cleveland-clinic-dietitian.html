It measures a person’s weight in pounds divided by the square of height in feet, according to the CDC.</p><p>But it doesn't tell the whole story.</p><p>"Body Mass Index does not tell us anything about where the fat is distributed," says <strong>Dr. David Creel, Ph.D., RD, </strong>a psychologist and registered dietitian in the Bariatric & Metabolic Institute at Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>Specifically, it tells doctors nothing about belly fat, which isn't just a vanity issue.</p><p>"Having excess body weight is most harmful around the midsection, particularly around our organs," Dr. Creel says. "It’s not pinching the subcutaneous fat. The subcutaneous fat isn’t really the problem. It’s the fat around the organs that push out on the abdominal wall.”</p><p>For example, research from 2017 suggests that visceral fat raises the risk for cardiometabolic issues in women, such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Dr. Creel says there's no shame in having fat around the midsection, but it's worth working on for your health.</p><p>"It’s a medical condition," Dr. Creel says. "We wouldn’t blame ourselves for having bad knees or an increased risk of cancer. It’s the same for obesity or belly fat."</p><p>Instead, Dr. Creel empowers his patients to reduce belly fat, including by avoiding certain habits. Here's everything you need to know about the very worst habit for fighting belly fat over the age of 50, plus other habits that can help with belly fat when you're older.</p><h2>What Is the Worst Habit for Fighting Belly Fat if You're Over 50?</h2><p>A sedentary lifestyle ups your risk for belly fat, Dr. Creel says. In fact, Dr. Creel would rather see a patient shed a few pounds while getting regular physical activity than drop a drastic amount of weight while staying sedentary.</p><p>"It’s better to lose a little weight and be physically active than to lose more without physical activity because you’re more likely to keep it off, and there are more metabolic effects," Dr. Creel says.</p><p>Dr. Creel says the American Heart Association's (AHA) guidelines call for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise each week.</p><p>“Moderate intensity means you can talk, but you can’t sing," Dr. Creel says. "If you can’t talk, that’s more vigorous."</p><p>But Dr. Creel says that even light-intensity movement like yoga can provide benefits. And, when it comes to weight loss, sometimes more is more.</p><p>"For weight loss, we sometimes see added benefits if people go beyond [the AHA recommendations]," Dr. Creel says.</p><p>But Dr. Creel stresses that consistency and diversity in activities are the most important factors for people over 50, who are more prone to aches, pains and strains.</p><p>"Instead of being a weekend warrior, do it consistently," Dr. Creel says. "Cross-train to prevent injury...to make sure you have a whole arsenal of activities you can do if you have aches and pain."</p><p>Cycling and water sports like swimming are low-impact ways to get cardio. A 2020 review of research on people 65 and older found that water exercise is a reasonable alternative to land-based activities to reduce falls and improve balance.</p><h2>What Are Other Habits To Reduce Belly Fat if You're Over 50?</h2><p>Getting a move on will help, but according to research on the topic and Dr. Creel, other habits will also help anyone, especially the over-50 population, reduce belly fat and keep it off.</p><p>Your diet also plays a role. Research from 2015 noted that diet and exercise could both bolster weight management outcomes but are better when people combine the two. Dr. Creel agrees. He suggests maintaining a diet high in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains and dairy (if you choose). </p><p>Dr. Creel knows dietary changes can be challenging and take time. Make things easier on yourself by shopping savvier.</p><p>"Make sure you have healthy options in your home that are easy to get to and easy to prepare," Dr. Creel says. "One way to help us do that is not shopping when we are hungry. Sometimes, we take kids with us and have a hard time saying no and wind up with 14 sugary-sweetened things in [our] home."</p><p>Pre-prepping or batch-making meals can help you stick to nutritious menus rather than hitting the drive-through when work or life gets in the way.</p><p>One major item to limit on your menu to reduce belly fat? Alcohol.</p><p>“People may drink to relax to go to sleep, but alcohol can affect sleep," Dr. Creel says.</p><p>Poor sleep is problematic when fighting belly fat, Dr. Creel says. A small 2022 study of 12 nonobese men found that sleep restriction played a role in increasing belly fat. Sleep needs and problems can evolve as we age.</p><p>“Sleep becomes more problematic as we age," Dr. Creel says. "Sleep apnea becomes more problematic as we age too. Age is a risk factor for sleep apnea."</p><p>Sleep apnea is a condition in which someone stops breathing while sleeping. Obesity is also a risk factor for it, according to the CDC. Dr. Creel suggests people struggling with sleep get checked for sleep apnea. Maintaining good sleep hygiene is also important.</p><p>"Try to have a schedule, like not napping a lot during the day, because it can throw off the sleep schedule," Dr. Creel says. </p><p>Another perk of nixing a sedentary lifestyle? More Zzz's.</p><p>"Physical activity can keep [sleep problems] in check," Dr. Creel says.</p><h2>What Should You Do if You're Concerned About Belly Fat?</h2><p>Use your healthcare provider as a non-judgmental sounding board. "Talk to your doctors about all the options," Dr. Creel says. "Lifestyle interventions can be helpful. We have medications that can help regulate appetite. We have medications to treat obesity and belly fat."</p><p>One more habit to avoid if you want to nix belly fat? Shaming yourself. "When someone has internal weight biases and puts themselves down, it makes it harder for them to change," Dr. Creel says.</p></main>
