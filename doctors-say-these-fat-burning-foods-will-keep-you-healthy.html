    <title>Doctors Say These Fat-Burning Foods Will Keep You Healthy</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Best part: They're all yummy. The term “fat-burning foods” sounds like it refers to ingredients that can, quite literally, take a blow torch to your abdomen and eliminate unwanted weight. Let us clear the air: That is not the case. However, there are foods known to boost metabolism and balance your caloric intake, both of which may help with weight loss, if that is your goal. Meet the Experts: Luiza Petre, M.D., a board-certified cardiologist and nutrition expert, Kimberly Gomer, M.S., R.D., L.D.N, director of nutrition at Pritikin Longevity Center, Laura Cipullo, R.D., nutritionist and co-author of Diabetes Comfort Food Diet, et al; Keri Gans, R.D., author of The Small Change Diet; and Scott Keatley, R.D. a nutritionist and co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy. “The key to sustained weight loss is to boost your metabolism and incorporate foods that help,” says Luiza Petre, M.D., a board-certified cardiologist and nutrition expert. It’s also important to maintain a calorie deficit, which means eating fewer calories than you burn. That may sound tricky to do, but choosing foods that help keep you fuller, longer is key. “The best and healthiest foods for weight loss are naturally high in fiber and water, and naturally low or moderately low in calorie density,” explains Kimberly Gomer, M.S., R.D., L.D.N, director of nutrition at Pritikin Longevity Center. Another important factor, according to Gomer, is to focus on whole foods over processed ones. From fruits and veggies to pasta and chocolate, we’ve corralled the best fat-burning foods to help you eat your way to looking and feeling your best.">

    <main><h1>Doctors Say These Fat-Burning Foods Will Keep You Healthy</h1><h2>Lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, salmon, and lean beef</h2><p>Research shows that a high-protein diet is an effective and safe tool for weight loss and preventing obesity-related diseases. That’s because protein not only promotes muscle growth and repair—as it is made up of amino acids, the building blocks of your muscle—but it is the preferred fuel to burn fat. “You actually burn more calories to process protein than carbs and fats,” explains Dr. Petre. This is due to the fact that it has a higher thermic effect, which is the energy you use to digest food into absorbable particles. It also keeps you from snacking, as it slows down digestion. “Over time the calories saved equal weight loss,” Dr. Petre adds. </p><p>A bonus? Protein also slows down the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, which wards off sweet cravings and keeps your blood sugar stable.</p><figure><img title="Lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, salmon, and lean beef" src="IMG/BB1iFzBi_lean_proteins_such_as_chicken_turkey_salmon_and_lean_beef.jpg" alt="Lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, salmon, and lean beef"><figcaption><em>Lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, salmon, and lean beef.

The easiest way to consume ginseng is by drinking it as tea (like this one). </p><figure><img title="Ginseng" src="IMG/BB1iFH4X_ginseng.jpg" alt="Ginseng"><figcaption><em>Ginseng.

It also may help lower inflammation and cholesterol, improve digestion, provide general relaxation, and burn fat. One study found increased ginger intake to be associated with decreased body weight in overweight and obese individuals.</p><h2>Turmeric</h2><p>Turmeric is believed to boost metabolism with its anti-inflammatory effects, according to Dr. Petre. “Turmeric also contains an anti-inflammatory component, curcumin, that suppresses inflammatory messaging in many cells, including fat, pancreatic, and muscle cells. This can help curb insulin resistance, high blood sugar, high cholesterol levels, and weight gain,” she adds.</p><h2>Kale</h2><p>Kale earns its superfood status by being low in calories and packed with vitamins and minerals. “Kale contains manganese, a mineral essential for processing food into energy for your cells,” explains Dr. Petre. It is also rich in protein, at 2 grams a cup, and is full of antioxidants that counteract aging and diseases such as cancer.</p><h2>Cucumber</h2><p> Cucumbers’ most significant contributor to weight loss is their high water and low calorie contents. In fact, one review of studies amounting to over 3,000 participants found that eating foods with high water and low calorie contents to be associated with a significant decrease in body weight. Cucumbers also contain the flavonol antioxidant, quercetin, shown to fight inflammation. “Packed with magnesium, the seeds help avoid constipation by hydrating the digestive lining,” Petre adds. </p><h2>Chocolate</h2><p>No, this is not a typo. According to Laura Cipullo, R.D., nutritionist and co-author of <em>Diabetes Comfort Food Diet</em>, chocolate can actually help keep your eating plan on track by preventing the “last supper” syndrome of binge eating. “In an effort to convert this attempt at being healthy to a new lifestyle, start with food you know you already love, such as dark chocolate or even milk chocolate,” she explains. Why chocolate? It contains antioxidants and is a source of satiating fat. “You need fat in your diet to feel full so don’t feel bad about including chocolate in your diet,” she says.</p><h2>Beans</h2><p>Beans are an important weight loss food, as they are not only versatile but will help you to feel full for hours due to their high content of insoluble fiber. “Insoluble fiber expands in your belly and GI tract when combined with any liquids. You may at first seem full and perhaps bloated, but the added liquid will help to create a bowel movement which leaves you feeling ‘regular’ and without bloat,” explains Cipullo. One study found that participants with high bean intake had less abdominal obesity than their counterparts, posing the idea that beans and legumes are ideal for weight management.</p><h2>Mushrooms</h2><p>Cipullo points out that button mushrooms contain glutamic acid, a compound that tastes just like salt. Instead of noshing on potato chips or salted nuts—foods that most of us struggle to eat in small quantities—add raw or cooked mushrooms to your sandwich, wrap, or as a side with lunch to get the salty taste you crave. You can also incorporate them in nearly every meal, including omelets, salads, wraps, stir fry, and stews. Animal studies have shown mushrooms’ effectiveness in reducing hypertension, inflammation, and obesity.</p><h2>Hummus</h2><p>The middle-eastern spread—made primarily out of garbanzo beans, olive oil, and tahini—is a great diet food, according to Cipullo. “It’s rich, creamy, and available in a myriad of satisfying flavors,” she explains. She suggests using one-third a cup to add to veggie sandwiches or just as a snack with a side of veggies. “When used in one-third cup portions, the hummus can qualify as both a source of vegetarian protein and monounsaturated fat.” A 2020 review of humus’ health benefits found it to be associated with improved nutrient intake, diet quality, and healthier eating habits overall.</p><figure><img title="Hummus" src="IMG/BB1iFxNp_hummus.jpg" alt="Hummus"><figcaption><em>Hummus.

When you notice yourself eating for behavioral reasons after dinner, grab a mug of warm water, or even a decaf herbal tea. </p><h2>Whole wheat pasta</h2><p>You don’t have to cut out foods to lose weight. “I don’t know any R.D.s who don’t eat pasta,” she says. She suggests eating whole wheat pasta, which will provide your carb fix while fueling your brain and muscles. “Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy from the brain and even muscles,” she adds. “Having carbohydrates stored in your muscles is essential to keep you energized in between meals and even while on the spin bike or during your favorite exercise class. Don’t fear carbs; rather find a way to include all foods in moderation.”</p><h2>Apples</h2><p>Cipullo strongly suggests making “an apple a day” your new mantra, mainly because the fruit is a great source of pectin, a filling fiber. “The pectin in apples really serves to satiate and the crunch when eating an apple appeals to psychological satisfaction,” she explains. Basically, you won’t need chips when you can crunch on crisp apples. One review that examined apples’ effect on weight loss found that five studies associated the consumption of whole apples or apple juice over a four to 12-week period can lead to weight loss in people who are overweight. </p><h2>Nut butter</h2><p>Cipullo maintains that a natural nut butter is ideal for preventing overeating. “As a nutritionist, I recognize the value of blood sugar and hormone management for identifying satiety and staying full,” she explains. “By eating carbs, proteins and fats together, you lower the glycemic load of the meal and therefore decrease your output of insulin.” Clients who are insulin resistant tend to feel hungrier and gain weight in their abdominal area, she says. “Eat peanut butter or almond butter with your overnight oats or your fruit at snack time,” she suggests. </p><h2>Avocado</h2><p>Avocado is rich in monounsaturated fat—the good kind—and is a great food to eat when you are trying to lose weight because it helps increase satiety until your next meal, explains Lisa Mikus, R.D., C.N.S.C., C.D.N., owner of Lisa Mikus Nutrition Therapy. She also points out that about half an avocado offers 6 grams of fiber and more potassium per gram than bananas.</p><h2>Spinach</h2><p>Packed with folate (an essential B vitamin) and fiber-friendly, this leafy green is a wonderful food to incorporate into your meals. “Spinach has a high water content which makes it lower in overall calories, while offering a high nutrient content,” explains Mikus. She suggests eating raw in salads, sautéing with olive oil, garlic, and lemon, or adding to smoothies.</p><h2>Whole eggs</h2><p>Eating whole eggs—versus just egg whites—provides fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and protein, according to Mikus. “The combination of fat and protein keeps you feeling full for a longer period of time while the body slowly breaks down these macronutrients,” she explains. A 2023 systematic review found that regular whole egg consumption beneficially affects body mass index in healthy people and those on weight loss diets.</p><figure><img title="Whole eggs" src="IMG/BB1iFFk8_whole_eggs.jpg" alt="Whole eggs"><figcaption><em>Whole eggs. Pongsak Tawansaeng / EyeEm - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Sweet potatoes and yams</h2><p>Sweet potatoes and yams are high in fiber, vitamin C, and also have high levels of the antioxidant beta-carotene. “This versatile root vegetable makes a wonderful addition to a balanced dinner and is even great as a snack,” Mikus says. One 2019 study found that sweet potatoes helped increase satiety in adults. </p><h2>Whole wheat English muffins</h2><p>Whole wheat English muffins offer B-vitamins, iron, and fiber, and just one provides 6 grams of protein and 130 calories. “Try topping with a sunny side up or a scrambled egg, or one to two tablespoons of almond or peanut butter for protein and fat,” Mikus suggests.</p><h2>Bananas</h2><p>Are bananas good for you? You bet! A banana, only 120 calories and boasting 3 grams of fiber, is a filling snack—especially when paired with a nut butter. A bonus? They provide a good source of potassium and magnesium, says Mikus.</p><h2>Greek yogurt</h2><p>Mikus explains that nutritionists prefer Greek yogurt over traditional yogurt because it’s higher in protein and naturally lower in sugar, especially when consumed plain. It is also a great source of protein, which helps balance the carbohydrates it provides. “Avoid buying 0% Greek yogurt, as 1% and 2% offer fat that will help keep you satisfied for longer,” she adds.</p><h2>Oatmeal</h2><p>Oatmeal not only provides soluble fiber, but has higher protein content than most other grains, explains Mikus. “Eat oatmeal in the mornings for a wholesome start to your day that will keep you full for three to four hours,” she advises. Consider topping with chopped almonds for more protein and blueberries for added fiber, and avoid sugary pre-made packets or toppings that are nutritionally lacking.</p><h2>It comes down to ratios.</h2><p>You can eat healthy foods but, ultimately, the amount of calories you take compared to the number of calories you burn is what matters, says Keri Gans, R.D., author of <em>The Small Change Diet</em><em>. </em>There are plenty of calculators online that can help you set goals, but the National Institute of Health’s Body Weight Planner is an easy tool to help you figure out the best caloric ratio for you. It has you enter your current weight and how active you are, along with your goal weight. It then calculates how many calories you should strive to take in on a daily basis to get to where you want to be.</p><h2>Snack wisely.</h2><p>Most people need to eat every three hours or so to feel comfortable, says Jessica Cording, R.D.<em>,</em> author of <em>The Little Book of Game-Changers. </em>That’s where snacks come in. But, of course, you want to snack smart. </p><p><em>“</em>Make snacks like mini-meals,” advises Scott Keatley, R.D. a nutritionist and co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy. </p><p>“The snack formula I tend to recommend is to have something with fiber and pair it with something with fat and/or protein,” Cording says. That could include having apple slices with nut butter or unsweetened Greek yogurt with a handful of berries and nuts.</p><h2>How to build out your meals for success.</h2><p>The right balance of protein, fiber, and fat in your meals (and snacks) will help you feel fuller, longer, Cording says. Gans suggests using the plate method to build out your meals. “One-quarter of the plate should be a protein—fish, chicken, or tofu—another quarter should be a carb—barley, sweet potato, or even pasta—and the remaining plate or dish, should be lots of veggies,” Gans says. </p><p>“The plate method may be useful in helping a person consume less calories per meal, especially at dinner time,” she adds.</p></main>
