Provided by Migraine Again</em></figcaption></figure><p>New daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a constant headache that never leaves. It’s a rare disease and has been the defining factor of my life since the day it started on July 24, 2016. It’s very similar to the feeling of a migraine attack, except it doesn't end. </p><p>With 70,000+ hours straight of debilitating pain, I can say it has changed every aspect of the way I live. From wearing sunglasses inside to missing family gatherings and events to being unable to finish high school in person and having my life revolve around doctor's appointments, I have had to adjust my entire lifestyle around what I can and cannot do with this condition. The journey has been difficult and is filled with potholes, stop signs, and even roadblocks. </p><p>It’s hard for people to really understand what I’m going through when they look at me and see someone that looks completely healthy. They can’t wrap their head around what's going on — especially when I’m often smiling through the pain. But my facial expression is just a mask because it's easier to pretend to be okay than to try and explain my situation. </p><p>Not even medical professionals like doctors, nurses, technicians, etc. take it as seriously as it truly is. Most of them haven’t even heard of NDPH. </p><h2>Using Music to Cope</h2><p>I am a musician, and music has been my medicine throughout the years. It’s something I can do by myself and without any lights. It can also be extremely quiet when I’m playing an electric guitar unplugged. This is how I have had some identity other than being a “sick person” throughout the years. </p><p>It’s given me the strength to occasionally go up on stage and perform — even if that means lying in bed for the next three days from the aftermath of putting on a show and pushing my body to its limit. </p><h2>The Importance of Advocacy</h2><p>Despite 47 million people in the United States living with migraine, there isn’t much funding put toward the disease. Migraine is often looked at as an “incurable disease,” but something is only impossible until it's accomplished. History has proved this time and time again. Migraine is one of the most common headache disorders, but there's a similar lack of funding for other disorders like cluster headache and my nemesis, NDPH. </p><p>I personally have felt the need to talk about this issue for two reasons. The first is that since it’s an invisible disease, we have to raise awareness so others can see its impact on people's lives. Unless it's affecting you or a loved one, people often turn a blind eye to it. </p><p>Second, not many men talk about headache disorders, or any health issues they have because they are shamed for it in our society. There is a stigma that men should be strong and not talk about their physical or mental health. </p><p>I can’t say how many times I've heard from people that it's just a headache. It's not a headache; it's a debilitating disease that we suffer in literal darkness, often confined to our rooms. One of the strongest things a person can do is battle through a war with their own body. </p><p>I recently decided to start advocating for those of us suffering from invisible disabilities, headaches, and/or chronic pain. I requested and received a proclamation from my Nevada state senator, Julie Pazina, to recognize June as Migraine and Headache Awareness Month. I’m also applying to participate in the Alliance for Headache Disorders Advocacy fall virtual Headache on the Hill.</p><h2>You’re Not Alone</h2><p>Hopefully, by getting this proclamation recognized by my senator, I can prove to other people with severe headache disorders that they’re capable of more than they know and that I, along with several others, see them for the warriors they are. </p><p>Until recently I was very private about my illness. I want to make others feel less alone and show them that I’m willing to walk side by side with them. Even if I have to come out and put myself in the public eye and show my struggle, so be it. </p><p>If you’re struggling with feelings of powerlessness due to a disabling headache disorder, you are not alone. Speaking up about your experience (see button below), engaging in advocacy, and seeking out others who understand can help you find purpose in your pain.</p></main>
