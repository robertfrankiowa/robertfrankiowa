    <main><h1>I've given up trying to cure my mental illness and it's done wonders for my wellbeing</h1><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1hYvcG_jen_sizeland_pictured_on_a_beach_with_a_dog.jpg" alt="Jen Sizeland pictured on a beach with a dog"><figcaption><em>There’s no big or exciting story about why I’m mentally ill (Picture: Jen Sizeland). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p class="">‘You have OCD.’</p><p class="">When I heard those words, I didn’t feel angry or sad. In all honesty, I felt bored and tired by it.</p><p class="">After 30 years of poor mental health, I wasn’t thrilled to be adding another condition to my list.</p><p class="">As well as OCD, I have generalised anxiety disorder, panic attacks, depressive periods and I used to self-harm.</p><p class="">Admittedly, that doesn’t look great on paper, but thanks to something called ‘radical acceptance’, I can now function and do the things I want to do.</p><p class="">I showed signs of OCD and anxious behaviour from an early age. I wouldn’t eat anything that I had touched for fear of contamination and if any part of my hand did make contact, then I would leave that bit on my plate.</p><p class="">I checked use-by dates obsessively. I constantly feared that the food I was eating was ‘off’ so I would throw it away or refuse to eat it.</p><p class="">There’s no big or exciting story about why I’m mentally ill either. I have therapy and there’s been no moment of revelation, no deep buried secret that explains my behaviour.</p><p class="">Just thousands of tiny moments of emotional damage that left lasting scars on my mind, coupled with the mundane reality of not having the support that I needed during my formative years.</p><p class="">I’m not alone. Mental health charity, Mind, estimate at least one in four people in England experience a mental health problem each year.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1hYjDB_jen_sizeland_on_a_boat_she_is_pictured_from_the_side_wearing_sunglasses_a_headband_and_a_striped_t_shirt.jpg" alt="Jen Sizeland on a boat, she is pictured from the side, wearing sunglasses, a headband and a striped t-shirt"><figcaption><em>It takes practice to stop obsessing over the things that go wrong but perfection is a lie (Picture: Jen Sizeland). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p class="">As an adult, I take full responsibility for my mental health but I have found the whole obsession with ‘getting over’ poor mental health frustrating.</p><p class="">I constantly struggle with the ever-present pressure to ‘get better’, and the reality for me is that, at 37, it’s unlikely that I will ever be a mentally well person (whatever that means).</p><p class="">At best, I’m a highly functioning depressive and, at my worst, I’m paralysed by my inner fears, repetitive thoughts and obsessions. </p><p class="">These take many forms as an adult. I once had an intrusive fear that I would lose an arm that lasted for six months. I had a knife phobia for around six years.</p><p class="">Eventually, I hit breaking point. I was commuting four hours a day for a stressful news job in 2015 and I really feared I would lose my mind. I spent my weekends in bed and experienced anxiety attacks during the night.</p><p class="">I wanted to find a way to be well in a world that feels increasingly unstable, especially in a country that doesn’t prioritise mental health care.</p><p class="">I was aware of the concept of radical honesty from working in the media industry and I felt like it could be a great idea for mental health. I wasn’t surprised to find that radical acceptance already existed so I thought I would try it.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1hYsLG_jen_sizeland_holding_her_baby.jpg" alt="Jen Sizeland holding her baby"><figcaption><em>Letting go of this idea of being mentally well has helped me irrevocably (Picture: Jen Sizeland). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p class="">This is a practice that means letting go of judgements, wishing things were different and the need to control things that you cannot do anything about. </p><p class="">This last part particularly resonated with me, as I want to control everything to make sure nothing bad happens – which, of course, is impossible.</p><p class="">It may sound very woo-woo and I can understand why people wouldn’t like the concept because we live in a world where we’re told if we believe and work hard enough, our circumstances will change.</p><p class="">Yet, letting go of this idea of being mentally well has helped me irrevocably.</p><p class="">I used to analyse each day for the places it went wrong, in the hope that the next day would be different. Instead of this obsessive perfectionism, I just let it go. </p><p class="">My problem is that I think about things over and over again, so I try to move my thoughts along to anything else, whether it’s a bird I can see out of the window or trying to remember celebrities who dated each other. </p><p class="">It takes practice to stop obsessing over the things that go wrong but perfection is a lie; something I remind myself of when I feel bad about not being better or achieving more.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1hYhdn_jen_sizeland_pictured_on_holiday.jpg" alt="Jen Sizeland pictured on holiday"><figcaption><em>When I had my baby two years ago, I experienced really bad postpartum anxiety (Picture: Jen Sizeland). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p class="">If I have an anxiety attack, I just accept it by not judging or scolding myself and I try to be neutral instead of making it about my emotional failings. This is a better alternative than letting it derail my entire week with self-blame and disappointment.</p><p class="">Years ago, I bought into this idea that I could jump out of bed every morning and live life with a ‘clean mind’, like something out of an advert.</p><p class="">I was forever hoping that negative emotions wouldn’t be a part of my life. As a child, I was always told ‘just be happy,’ as if it was a magic button that I could just press, and I believed it.</p><h2 class="metro-factbox-title green no-icon">                    Need support?   </h2><p> </p><p class="">Now, I find it weirdly comforting to let go of the expectation of everlasting ‘okayness’.</p><p class="">Of course, I still have the same anxieties and obsessions, they just manifest in different ways. When I had my baby two years ago, I experienced really bad postpartum anxiety. I was afraid to leave the house with him and checked he was still breathing an unhealthy number of times.</p><p class="">However, I accepted that it was a huge hormonal shift and life change, so it was normal to feel this way.</p><p class="">I also had breastfeeding problems and three mastitis infections in the first six months so I forgave myself for feeling negatively about the experience.</p><p class="">As a society, we never tell women to do that, but we certainly should. Because early motherhood can be very triggering and scary, it certainly was for me.</p><p class="">Only now I can accept it. All of it. No matter how ugly or sad it has been, and the toll that emotional pain has taken on my life.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1hYjDE_jen_sizeland_smiling_in_selfie_wearing_sungarees_and_black_sunglasses.jpg" alt="Jen Sizeland smiling in selfie, wearing sungarees and black sunglasses"><figcaption><em>For the most part, my days aren’t ruined by fear or obsession any more (Picture: Jen Sizeland).
