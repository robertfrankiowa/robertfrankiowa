A report from the American Psychological Association states that in 2023, about a third of people aged 18–44 rated their stress levels as an 8–10 on a scale of 1–10. So if you’re feeling constant stress, you’re not alone.</p><p>“Stress is a natural response to the demands and pressures of life. It can be triggered by various factors, including work responsibilities, financial issues, relationship problems and major life changes,” says Edmond Hakimi, D.O., Board-Certified Internal Medicine Physician and Medical Director at Wellbridge.</p><p>Notably, stress can have serious physical, behavioral and mental effects that greatly impact health. So, stress management is an important part of caring for your health. Read on to learn more about the physical, mental and behavioral effects of stress, plus expert tips to manage it.</p><h2>Physical Effects of Stress</h2><h3>Cardiovascular System</h3><p>“The cardiovascular system is particularly vulnerable, as stress increases heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to long-term heart problems,” says Marcus Smith, LCPC, LPC, LCADC, Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor and Executive Director at Alpas Wellness.</p><p>The presence of stress hormones like cortisol and epinephrine leads to oxidative stress and inflammation, which increase cardiovascular risk.</p><p>“It can also cause the constriction of coronary artery vessels, which can result in myocardial ischemia,” says Andrew Sherwood, P.h.D., Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University School of Medicine. In extreme cases, this can lead to a heart attack, says Sherwood.</p><h3>Respiratory System</h3><p>When stress is high, breathing may become shallow and rapid. Plus, the risk of contracting a respiratory illness or exacerbating an existing respiratory condition is higher since stress worsens the body’s immune response. Plus, inflammatory cytokines are released, which increases mucus production and constricts airways.</p><p>Hence, why deep breathing exercises can often help reduce stress.</p><h3>Immune System</h3><p>When the body detects stress, the immune system weakens. “The endocrine system responds by releasing stress hormones like cortisol, which, when elevated for prolonged periods, can disrupt metabolic functions and weaken the immune system,” says Smith. </p><p>This, in turn, can increase infection susceptibility and worsen chronic inflammatory diseases, says Sherwood.</p><h3>Digestive System</h3><p>When we experience stress, neurohormones called catecholamines get released, which notably impacts our gastrointestinal system. Ultimately, blood flow to the gut gets reduced, which can cause diarrhea or constipation, depending on the person. Unsurprisingly, studies have found that stress is tightly linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</p><p>Besides IBS, Sherwood says stress can also increase acid reflux.</p><h3>Musculoskeletal System</h3><p>It’s no secret that stress can cause muscle tension. Just think of how you’d feel about getting a massage after a stressful work week. Well, that’s due to the cascade of physiological responses that happen when your body experiences stress. The activation of the sympathetic nervous system as a result of stress can lead to muscle tension, headaches and migraines, notes Sherwood.</p><h3>Reproductive System</h3><p>High stress may stifle sexual desire and reproductive functioning. It suppresses the release of key reproductive hormones that play a role in testosterone production and ovarian function. As a result, chronic stress can cause irregular periods, decreased sperm quality and even infertility.</p><h2>Mental Effects of Stress</h2><h3>Anxiety and Depression</h3><p>“Prolonged or unmanaged stress can cause such internal disruption that it actually triggers mental health conditions. When we have a really stressful life (or we are not managing our stress well), we are more likely to have depression, anxiety, OCD, substance use disorders, eating disorders, etc,” says Morosi.</p><p>This is called the “exhaustion stage” of the stress response, which happens when stress becomes chronic. Other symptoms of this stage include burnout, fatigue and reduced stress tolerance.</p><h3>Cognitive Impairment</h3><p>Not all stress is bad, and one potential benefit of short-term stress is sharpened cognitive function. However, “When stress becomes overwhelming, it can impair cognitive functions like concentration and decision-making, making everyday tasks seem daunting,” says Hakimi.</p><h2>Behavioral Effects of Stress</h2><h3>Appetite Changes</h3><p>When your stress levels are too high, “We might stop getting hunger cues (or the internal messages to start eating), and we might stop getting fullness cues (of the internal messages to stop eating),” says Amorosi.</p><p>Ultimately, stress can reduce your ability to eat healthily or intuitively, cause nausea or other gastrointestinal disturbances, lead to food aversions, or increase the risk of binge eating, says Amorosi.</p><p>Stress and sleep are a two-way street. High stress may lead to poor sleep, and poor sleep may increase stress.</p><p>According to the American Psychological Association, adults who report less stress say they get more, better-quality sleep than those who report high stress. Stress often causes increased anxiety and alertness, which can cause insomnia, notes Smith.</p><p>In other cases, sleep can be used as a means of escaping stress without getting to the root of the issue. “For example, if I oversleep when I am anxious because it helps me avoid my stressors, I may disrupt my sleep cycle, which puts my mood at risk of worsening,” says Amorosi.</p><p>When stress is high, some people may find themselves gravitating towards alcohol or drugs for relief. “It [stress] might lead to maladaptive coping mechanisms, like substance abuse and/or excessive alcohol consumption, which can further diminish the ability to cope and lead to interpersonal conflicts and/or social isolation,” says Sherwood.</p><h2>Strategies to Manage and Reduce Stress</h2><p>Since stress can worsen health, it’s worth finding ways to manage it in your daily life. If possible, incorporate these into your routine rather than waiting until you’re drowning in stress to take action. </p><p>To manage stress, Morosi recommends a combination of:</p><ul><li>Relaxing yourself through soothing, calming, mindful practices</li><li>Maintaining a routine of self-care and NOT neglecting your basic needs</li><li>Maintaining a connection to healthy and supportive people so you don’t feel alone</li><li>Using rational problem-solving skills to find solutions to stress</li><li>Finding radical acceptance around life being challenging and imperfect</li><li>Using positive self-talk and maintaining good self-esteem even through challenges</li></ul><p>Some additional practices that may help include physical activity, which reduces endorphins that can help boost your mood, per Hakimi; deep-breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga; and eating regular, well-rounded meals. </p><p>If you’re worried your stress levels might wreak your health, it may be worth seeing a healthcare provider. “Some symptoms to be attuned to include feeling depressed, chronically anxious, helpless, unable to sleep, repeated headaches, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, panic attacks, inability to moderate alcohol consumption or drug abuse. Seeing a primary healthcare provider can be a good place to start,” says Sherwood.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>As you can see, stress can have profound, widespread effects on the body and mind. If you’re dealing with high stress levels, it’s worth centering de-stressing practices in your wellness routine. These could include meditation, socialization, positive self-talk, and working with a therapist to help you cope with stress effectively.</p></main>
