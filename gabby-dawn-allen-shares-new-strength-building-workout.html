    <main><h1>Gabby Dawn Allen Shares New Strength-Building Workout</h1><p>Gabby Dawn Allen is getting back in shape! Gabby is a fitness influencer with over one million followers on Instagram. Her main goal? "To make fitness fun," she says in her bio. Earlier this month, Gabby underwent an augmentation surgery and has been sharing updates with her followers. This week, she revealed that she was back in the gym with a new routine. Here is everything you need to know about it.</p><figure><img title="Gabby Dawn Allen Shares New Strength-Building Workout" src="IMG/BB1pBIFn_gabby_dawn_allen_shares_new_strength_building_workout.jpg" alt="Gabby Dawn Allen Shares New Strength-Building Workout"><figcaption><em>Gabby Dawn Allen Shares New Strength-Building Workout. gabbydawnallen/Instagram</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 She Is Doing a 5 Day Split</h2><p>Gabby reveals that the workout is a 5-day split of glutes, upper and lower limbs, legs heavy, and HIIT and abs-slash legs light. "As I have been sat more than usual, I have lost some of my … gains, so I am back to incorporating three lower body sessions into my week, one fully focused on glutes, one heavy leg day, which will also include some glutes and one lighter leg day, which will include explosive movements too," she explains.</p><h2>2 It Involves Progressive Overload "To Regain Strength"</h2><p>Gabby added that she is doing progressive overload to regain strength. "I have lost my ability to lift the same weight that I had done prior to surgery, so I will be working on the same program for the next 6 to 8 weeks whilst I focus on gradually increasing the weight to get me back to where I left off," she explains. "Muscle memory is a powerful thing if I do this safely and smartly, I should be back there in no time."</p><figure><img title="2 It Involves Progressive Overload " to="" regain="" strength""="" src="IMG/BB1pBNIz_2_it_involves_progressive_overload_to_regain_strength.jpg" alt="2 It Involves Progressive Overload " to="" regain="" strength""=""><figcaption><em>2 It Involves Progressive Overload "To Regain Strength". © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 She Is Prioritizing Rest and Recovery</h2><p>Gabby also revealed that she is prioritizing rest and recovery. "The only way our muscles will grow is if they have enough downtime. I will be training lower body three times a week, but how I structure the program is what will enable me to do this. For example, hamstrings will be the dominating muscle focused on in the heavier workout and the quads on the lighter days," she says in the post.</p><figure><img title="3 She Is Prioritizing Rest and Recovery" src="IMG/BB1pBLde_3_she_is_prioritizing_rest_and_recovery.jpg" alt="3 She Is Prioritizing Rest and Recovery"><figcaption><em>3 She Is Prioritizing Rest and Recovery. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 She Is Increasing Protein Intake on Maintenance Calories</h2><p>Gabby is also increasing protein intake on maintenance calories. "I have tried to focus on hitting my protein macro, but I've also been in a calorie deficit as coming back into training," she writes. "I wanted my focus to be on building my strength back up, not losing weight. I will increase my focus on getting 2 g of protein per kilo of body weight, and I am also going to increase my calories to maintain my weight again as my level of exercise is now increasing. I am going to need to fuel these glutes back up, baby!"</p><figure><img title="4 She Is Increasing Protein Intake on Maintenance Calories" src="IMG/BB1pBGzG_4_she_is_increasing_protein_intake_on_maintenance_calories.jpg" alt="4 She Is Increasing Protein Intake on Maintenance Calories"><figcaption><em>4 She Is Increasing Protein Intake on Maintenance Calories. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 She Is Continuing with Her Daily Average Step Count</h2><p>Gabby is also keeping up with her steps. "I have been walking my little socks off during this downtime to keep my NEAT taking over; this, alongside my deficit, has helped me keep some KG offs. I am aiming to keep the step count up because whilst the goal is to grow the booty with the workout and food, I also want to stay lean," she says.</p><h2>6 She Is Patient and Consistent</h2><p>Finally, Gabby is being patient and consistent with her progress. "After any downtime, if it surgery induced or not, it is important to be kind to yourself, and remember how long it took you to get to this far, you WILL get back to your best. Set yourself a goal, stick to your plan, and make it happen," she concludes. And if you enjoyed this article, don't miss 12-3-30 Walking Method: 20 Proven Tips to Lose Weight Faster.</p></main>
