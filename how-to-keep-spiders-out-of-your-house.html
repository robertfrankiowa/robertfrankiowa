Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p>Spiders are a scary-looking bunch. They have their eight legs, beady little eyes, some fur (that is often microscopic), and fangs! This combination of features can be terrifying, but thankfully most spiders (which are part of the arachnid class that includes scorpions, ticks, and mites) are harmless to humans and can be beneficial to their natural environment—they indirectly help with pollination and consume pests like mosquitos! So while spiders certainly have their positives, they’re not exactly the most desirable housemates. If you’re dealing with creepy-crawlies, there <em>are</em> steps you can take to remedy the situation—we asked a pest control expert for their best tips and advice on how to keep spiders out of your house.</p><h2>How to Prevent Spiders</h2><p>Fear not! There are plenty of steps you can take to ensure you’ll be spidey-free. </p><h3>Seal and Block Common Entry Points</h3><p>Because spiders are so itty-bitty, they can navigate through the cracks and crevices of your home with ease. According to Dihonov, the most frequent points of entry are windows, doors, roof eaves, foundation cracks, and ventilation openings. He suggests addressing many of these zones by doing the below:</p><ul><li>A weather-flexible caulk or sealant should be used to eliminate any cracks or openings. </li><li>Any damaged door strips and sweeps should be replaced preventing access to the inside. Proper screening mesh material should be used behind the crawl space and attic vent openings. </li><li>Placing caps over the fireplace chimney and exhaust pipe openings should be completed as well.   </li></ul><h3>Keep Your House Clean and Clutter-Free</h3><p>A well-maintained home bustling with lots of activity is<em> not</em> an ideal location for spiders. Dihonov explains, “Spiders prefer dark, undisturbed areas like stored boxes in basements, attics, closets, and areas of the home that don’t get much daily activity, as well as under and behind furniture.” Constantly tidying up is a must to keep spiders at bay.</p><p>He suggests vacuuming both inside and outside the home, recommending the long extension of your vacuum to reach all the corners, nooks, and crannies. (When you’re done, always empty the vacuum or dispose of the collecting bag.) A dusting tool fitted with a telescoping handle can be used for web removal as well. He adds, “Clutter is the ideal invitation for them—a pile of clothes on the floor, accumulated garbage bags, holiday decorations scattered around and so on.” So it’s crucial to keep things in order.</p><h3>Kick Out the Other Bugs</h3><p>Dihonov says the only way to truly deter spiders is to minimize the insect activity around your home. “No prey means no food for them and they will move away searching for it. So pest-proofing your home is the biggest deterrent in spider control,” he says. </p><h3>Plant Natural Repellents</h3><p>You<em> can</em> opt to use chemical-free solutions to curb eight-legged guests, such as essential oils and homemade concoctions (like soapy water), but Dihonov notes those will only go so far, saying “The results are objectively unreliable with short-term relief in the overall issue.” He <em>does</em> say that mint, lavender, and lemongrass have natural insect repellency.</p><p>According to him, “Incorporating those types of plants into your garden, flower beds, or exterior perimeter can reduce the overall pest pressure and help decrease the attractiveness of your home to spiders, as well.” So if you want to go the natural route, that’s probably your best bet. However, he adds that the best and time-proven method of reducing spider activity around your home is to keep your home in good physical condition by utilizing preventative, sanitation, and mechanical measures.</p><p>You’ve addressed the interior of your home, but you really shouldn’t forget the exterior—that’s where they’re coming from after all! Dihonov says there are many important steps you can take to decrease the attractiveness of your home to spiders, such as:</p><ul><li>Sealing or screening doors, windows, and other gaps around the structure. </li><li>Move lights to off-building locations or simply point the lighting towards the house rather than having them on it. </li><li>Change the bulbs near the entrance doors or the porch from the bright white to the yellow hue ones.</li><li>Keep both inside and outside premises free of debris and clutter. </li><li>Mow your grass to 3 inches or less, and keep other vegetation trimmed and away from the building. </li><li>Remove any new spider webbing that you see and inspect your house at least monthly for that.  :</li></ul><h2>Seeking Professional Help</h2><p>If you find that the spiders have seriously taken over your home, and the actions you’ve taken to mitigate this haven’t helped, it might be time to call a professional. Dihonov recommends taking a high-quality, clear photo of the spider (or even capturing one in a plastic zip top bag or jar) to help them identify the species. He says this “is paramount in preparing a comprehensive plan of attack.” A thorough inspection will be performed, and insect monitors might be placed around the home. He details the rest of the process saying, “An outside perimeter treatment with approved chemicals will be completed as well. Physical removal of webbing and possible spider egg sacs will take place. Some trained professionals also offer exclusion services.” </p><h2>Dangerous Spiders You Should Watch Out For</h2><p>There are over 3,000 types of spiders in North America but a majority of them are safe to coexist with! However, Dihonov warns of two spiders that are major threats to humans—the brown recluse spider and the black widow spider. Brown recluses are primarily in the South, but black widows can actually be found across the country. Dihonov strongly recommends inspecting these outdoor areas regularly so they don’t creep into your home:</p></main>
