But did you know your workouts also give your brain a major tune-up? A fascinating new study shows that physical activity can actually reduce stress-related brain signals, protecting your heart in the process.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact of stress on the body</h2><p>It's no secret that stress takes a toll on the body. When stress becomes chronic, our bodies release a surge of the stress hormone cortisol. This hormone is meant for short-term survival responses, but constant elevation leads to a cascade of problems. </p><p>Cortisol can contribute to high blood pressure, weight gain, and an increased risk of heart disease. But how does the brain play a role in this dangerous cycle?</p><p>Scientists are increasingly interested in how our brains handle the pressure of stress. Imagine your brain contains a tiny alarm system called the amygdala. When you're under stress, this alarm gets triggered and goes into overdrive, sending signals of danger throughout the body. </p><p>Fortunately, your brain also has a region called the prefrontal cortex. This area is responsible for logic, reasoning, and self-control. Think of it as the part of your brain that can calm the alarm down. Under normal circumstances, your prefrontal cortex can manage the amygdala's stress signals. </p><p>However, under chronic stress, the amygdala can become hyperactive, overwhelming your brain's ability to manage the response.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise benefits the brain and the heart</h2><p>Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reveal that physical activity quiets stress-related brain activity, especially giving that hardworking prefrontal cortex a boost.</p><p>"Physical activity was roughly twice as effective in lowering cardiovascular disease risk among those with depression," explains Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, a cardiologist at MGH and the study's lead author. "Effects on the brains' stress-related activity may explain this novel observation."</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise, a power prescription</h2><p>Researchers in this study carefully analyzed a massive amount of health data collected from over 50,000 individuals. This type of large-scale study gives scientists a much clearer picture of the real-world impact of physical activity. </p><p>Individuals who consistently met recommended physical activity guidelines (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week) had a significant advantage. They had a 23% lower risk of developing heart disease compared to those who didn't get enough exercise.</p><p>Those who were physically active also showed a fascinating change: lower levels of stress-related activity within their brains. This suggests that exercise has a direct, calming effect on the areas of the brain that manage stress responses.</p><p>Importantly, this calming effect on the brain seemed to play a major role in protecting the heart. The researchers believe that the reduced stress response from exercise is a key reason why physically active people enjoy a lower risk of heart disease.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise for depression and heart health</h2><p>The study revealed a particularly encouraging discovery. Individuals who struggled with depression actually gained even more heart-healthy benefits from exercise than those without depression. This means that for people facing the challenges of chronic stress and depression, regular physical activity could be a particularly powerful tool in protecting their hearts. </p><p>The idea that those who might be feeling the most overwhelmed by stress could benefit the most from exercise is a remarkable and inspiring takeaway.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise in daily life</h2><p>The study adds even more power to the simple recommendation to "get moving". Here's what to keep in mind:</p><ul>     <li>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (activities like brisk walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (like running) each week, plus muscle-strengthening exercises twice a week.</li>     <li>Even short bursts of activity throughout the day can lower stress and improve your health.</li>     <li>Exercise can be a blast. Dance class, swimming, hiking â€“ if it's fun, you're more likely to keep it up.</li>  </ul><p>While more research is needed, it's becoming clearer that exercise can change your brain in remarkable ways. Want a healthier heart <em>and</em> a calmer mind? Your sneakers are your new secret weapons!</p><p>Note: If you're new to exercise, have health concerns, or suffer from depression, always talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program.</p><p>The study is published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</p><p>-----</p><p>Check us out on EarthSnap, a free app brought to you by Eric Ralls and Earth.com.</p><p>-----</p></main>
