Here's how four years of lifting transformed her body.. Christine Giordano / Julia Linn</em></figcaption></figure><p>I was always athletic as a kid and loved swimming, cheerleading, and running track. When I was 11, I was diagnosed with diabetes and developed neuropathy, blindness, heart disease, and failing kidneys, which all made working out a lot harder.</p><p>I was in and out of the hospital. There were a lot of close calls where I didn't know if I would make it through the night. I did everything I could to take care of myself but nothing worked. My body didn't respond and it was so demoralizing. </p><p>When my kidneys officially failed at 34, doctors gave me a choice: I could start dialysis but likely not live past 40, or I could undergo an experimental double organ transplant to get a new kidney and new pancreas to potentially cure the diabetes. Surgery was risky, but I wanted to have my entire life ahead of me and didn't want to live with diabetes anymore.</p><p>Fortunately, the surgery was successful. However, in my 40s my heart disease progressed, and I had a dysfunctional thyroid. I underwent cardiac triple bypass surgery and had my thyroid removed. </p><p>By the time I was 62, I was so grateful to be alive. To celebrate my body and resilience, I decided to get as fit as I possibly could. </p><h2 class="body-h2">After a lifetime of battling chronic illness, I started strength training at 62 and began to realize my potential.</h2><p>I was living in Mexico at the time and came across a three-month online strength challenge for people over 40. The focus was to lift weights and maximize nutrition while going easy on the joints. I signed up for the program and committed to working hard. I didn’t realize there would be a winner, but after three months, I made the most progress and won the challenge.</p><p>I had never lifted weights before, but I was hooked. My body was finally responding to being well-cared for after everything it endured, and I felt great. I was empowered I could push myself to new limits and I didn’t want to stop.</p><p>A year later, I moved back to the states and hired a personal trainer. My goal was to achieve optimal wellness. I didn’t care about losing weight or the number on the scale at all. I wanted to lift heavier weights with proper form, learn more about my body, and maximize my potential.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Now, I work out five days a week with a personal trainer.</h2><p>I still work with the same personal trainer, and we do 45-minute sessions with an upper and lower body split. I typically do 4 sets of 10 to 15 reps of eight different exercises. Technically, they’re supersets because I only rest for 30 seconds in between. I get a lot done in a short amount of time. </p><p>Upper body is my favorite and I love all things shoulders and arms. Hamstrings are my weakest link, but I work especially hard at training my quads and glutes. Recently, I conquered eight leg presses at 450 pounds (a new PR!). </p><h2 class="body-h2">I never deprive myself, but I focus on balanced nutrition and track macros to maximize my training. </h2><p>I’ve always known the importance of a balanced diet, especially with my health issues, but I started tracking macros to maximize nutrition and support my training. I use the My Macros+ app to stay organized and eat five small meals a day. I focus on adding color to my plate and prioritize lean protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats. I always have cut veggies in my fridge. Salmon, chicken, tuna, Greek yogurt, egg whites, and purple sweet potato are some of my favorites to fill my plate. </p><p>All that said, I never deprive or restrict myself. If I want dessert, I have it. It’s all about balance and I’ve found what works for me. </p><h2 class="body-h2">When I discovered bodybuilding, I took my strength to the next level to be an example for women of all ages.</h2><p>My coach saw how hard I worked in the gym, and how much I loved it, and suggested I compete in a masters bikini bodybuilding competition. I thought there’s no way anyone wants to see me in a bikini, but I decided to go for it and celebrate my body. At 64 and the same month of the 30-year anniversary of my organ transplant, I competed in my first championship. I won, and I was hooked. </p><p>Getting strong and feeling confident in my body is tough to beat. To prep for the competition I focused on building muscle with heavy weight training and a calorie surplus. Right before the show I started my "cut" and reduced overall calorie intake to shed body fat and reveal lean muscle. Training for competitions became my new lifestyle, and I thrived on the system of discipline and motivation I built. Working out and fueling my body with healthy nutrients became second nature. </p><p>The cherry on top? I get to set an example for other women, younger and older, and inspire them to do the same. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Julia Linn’s Favorite Fitness Products For Strength At 66</h2><p><h2 class="body-h2">These three things were key to my strength transformation success.</h2><p><strong>1. I built a community of like-minded women to support and inspire my journey.</strong></p><p>Menopause is confusing and your body undergoes a lot of change, but finding a community of women who can relate made a huge difference for me and what I was able to do physically. Giving and receiving support from others in my age group is so inspiring. I truly believe in the power of connection. I’ve found so much gold in my community, both online and in-person, and growing with other strong women is a recipe for success. </p><p><strong>2. I realized that my body is resilient, and I’m capable of doing hard things. </strong></p><p>I’ve had my fair share of health scares, and I’m so proud of my body for overcoming the challenges. Through all the hospitalizations and complications, here I am at 66, not only lifting heavy weights but winning competitions. Going to the gym and hitting new PRs is proof that my body is resilient. I’m just so grateful to be alive.</p><p><strong>3. I understand that confidence is key to my success. </strong></p><p>My goal is to constantly take care of my health and treat my body with compassion. I’ve cut out all negative self-talk and replaced it with total confidence. I’m strong, proud, and capable, and I show up every day as my authentic self. </p><p>After decades of being sick, I finally feel good and I’m going to do everything in my power to continue this path.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
