    <main><h1>With These Home Gym Systems, You Can Build Out Your Own Workout Setup</h1><h2>PR3000 Home Gym</h2><p>A recognizable name in the world of home gyms, this option from BowFlex others a true full-body workout in just one machine. With detailed instructional workouts and up to 210 pounds of resistance, you can target any major muscle group from your shoulders to your legs.</p><p>The upright bench provides a solid base for more than 50 exercises to do sitting or standing. We appreciate the seven-year warranty on the rods though the frame’s one-year warranty isn’t nearly as generous. </p><p>While the home gym system comes with detachable handles, you can also buy other attachments to expand your workout regimen over time.</p><h2>Multifunctional Home Gym</h2><p>While not the cheapest home gym system on our list, this option from Marcy gets the best value tag for its incredible versatility considering its price. </p><p>The home gym system is constructed from premium heavy-duty steel and is reinforced with guard rods that hold weight in place during workouts. </p><p>This option from Marcy also features a 150-pound weight stack that can be customized to your needs, making it a great option if you don’t want to load and unload weight plates. The dual-action press arms and removable curl pad mean you can work your upper and lower body all on one machine.</p><figure><img title="Multifunctional Home Gym" src="IMG/AA16FtaH_multifunctional_home_gym.jpg" alt="Multifunctional Home Gym"><figcaption><em>Multifunctional Home Gym. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Pro Smith Cage Workout Machine</h2><p>Another comprehensive home gym system from Marcy, this option doesn’t come cheap, but it sure offers a whole lot of bells and whistles. </p><p>The entire frame is made from heavy-duty steel and reinforced with a durable powder-coated finish. It offers tensile strength up to 2,000 pounds, and is designed with dual-action press arms for a wide variety of arm and chest exercises. </p><p>There’s also a dual-function leg developer with six rocker pads and a row and curl bar. If you have weights and barbells, you can store them in the plate pegs that are built into the frame. The only downside is the size, but it’s the only machine you’ll need for your entire body.</p><figure><img title="Pro Smith Cage Workout Machine" src="IMG/AA16ETzZ_pro_smith_cage_workout_machine.jpg" alt="Pro Smith Cage Workout Machine"><figcaption><em>Pro Smith Cage Workout Machine. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Evo Gym</h2><p>This home gym system is portable, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. You can train with anywhere from 10 to 320 pounds worth of resistance on this making it perfect for everything from bicep curls to squats. All that this home gym is made of is an aircraft-grade aluminum base, 10 tension bands, ankle straps, a door anchor, and a weight bar. </p><p>It works by pitting your body weight against the tension on the bands, providing a surprising amount of resistance while only weighing about 16 pounds. This Evo system also comes with a safety guide, training videos, and a 1-year warranty.</p><h2>Universal Total Body Training Home Gym</h2><p>Forget the bulky weights and massive structures. This home gym from Total Gym is designed to take on more than 80 exercises in one machine with a relatively minimal footprint. </p><p>At just over 93 pounds, it can be moved in a pinch as well. This gym system is perfect for cardio, strength training, and stretching all in one place, modeled like a Pilates reformer on an angle. </p><p>It features an ab crunch, wing attachment, exercise chart, training deck, and meal planning guide, among other features. It also comes with seven DVDs on the Total Gym TV video platform, providing both pros and fitness newbies with instructions on the most efficient ways to use the machine.</p><h2>FitForm Home Gym Strength Trainer</h2><p>This machine is a great option for those who want a small, low-impact system that can be tucked away as needed. FitForm works every muscle group with more than 100 exercises. </p><p>With cable resistance of 65 pounds, and consistent, smooth tension, this home gym system minimizes hard, jerky movements that put greater tension on your joints.</p><p>The soft-grip handles, adjustable ankle wraps, swiveling pulleys, and the three-position platform give you freedom of movement and plenty of options for getting sweaty.</p><p>The machine also comes with a free personal training app where you can access trainer-led workouts, custom workout routines, and an exercise library. Customers love this machine for improving flexibility.</p><figure><img title="FitForm Home Gym Strength Trainer" src="IMG/AA16FDgX_fitform_home_gym_strength_trainer.jpg" alt="FitForm Home Gym Strength Trainer"><figcaption><em>FitForm Home Gym Strength Trainer. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Cable Pull Station Trainer</h2><p>A comprehensive home gym system, this option from Titan Fitness is a near complete gym with the price tag to prove it.

Like a classic rack, this option comes with space for weight storage, attachable bar hooks to transition between squats and bench press, as well as two pull up bars with differing grip thickness.</p><p>The system is made of powder-coated steel and is rated to hold up to 1,000 pounds with ease. What sets this home gym system apart from other, comparable choices is the number of attachments it comes with.</p><p>This include a lat pulldown/row cable attachment you can load weight on your set, an incline-capable bench, and even an attachable tricep dip device. </p><figure><img title="PR-1000 Power Rack Home Gym with Attachments" src="IMG/AA1mP1Ns_pr_1000_power_rack_home_gym_with_attachments.jpg" alt="PR-1000 Power Rack Home Gym with Attachments"><figcaption><em>PR-1000 Power Rack Home Gym with Attachments. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Go Suspension Trainer System Home Gym</h2><p>This lightweight budget buy offers fast, effective workouts that you can do from anywhere without installing a thing. Just wrap the anchor around a sturdy pole or tree and get to sweating. </p><p>The TRX system includes a suspension training strap, indoor and outdoor anchors, a mesh carry bag, and access to online workouts. </p><p>The system is designed to increase strength and reduce injury risk, with support for up to 700 pounds.
