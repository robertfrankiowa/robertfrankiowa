One minute he was asking questions, and the next he was discussing treatment options. When I interrupted to ask if I did, in fact, have ADHD he laughed in surprise and said, “Oh yeah,” as though it was painted on my forehead clear as day. </p><p>In retrospect, it shouldn’t have been a surprise. Both sides of my family have a history of ADHD, and I showed many of the symptoms from a very early age. However, because I did not fit the stereotypical image of a hyper boy who got in trouble a lot, no one thought to have me tested.  </p><p>Even though ADHD is a well-known form of neurodivergence, it is still widely misrepresented and misunderstood. While representation has increased thanks to books and shows like “Percy Jackson and the Olympians,” many who could benefit from ADHD treatments go undiagnosed well into adulthood. </p><p>The broad question of “What is ADHD?” is a tough one to answer for such an individualized condition. In sharing my story with you, I hope to best explain its symptoms, genetic properties, treatment options, and more. Nothing I say here is meant to substitute for the words of a trained medical professional, but, at best, I hope it opens the door to a potentially life-changing conversation. </p><h2>What is ADHD?</h2><p>According to the CDC, ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that exists from birth and can last the entirety of a person’s life. That same source suggests an estimated 9.8% of children (about 6 million) were diagnosed with ADHD as of 2019, while non-profit CHADD estimates 4.4% of all adults currently live with ADHD. </p><p>ADHD is a form of neurodivergence, which basically means that the way the brain works differs from the average person. These differences are not inherently bad—and can in fact be a huge advantage in some aspects of life. However, those with neurodivergence often face specific struggles in a society that’s built with neurotypical people in mind. </p><h2>What are the symptoms of ADHD?</h2><p>Below is a list of the most common symptoms of ADHD, as outlined by the CDC. While this list may be helpful in deciding whether or not to discuss ADHD testing with a medical professional, it’s important to understand that having one or two of these symptoms does not mean you have ADHD. </p><p>Most people experience a few similar symptoms at some point in their lives on rare occasion. The difference is that a person with ADHD might experience five or more of these symptoms regularly in a way that has a consistent, noticeable impact on their daily life.  </p><ul> <li><p>Trouble paying attention</p> </li> <li><p>Difficulty controlling impulsive behaviors</p> </li> <li><p> Forgetting or losing things frequently</p> </li> <li><p> Fidgeting and/or difficulty sitting still</p> </li> <li>Talking a lot more than peers </li> <li><p>Often being overwhelmed by too many competing thoughts, which may look like daydreaming to others</p> </li> <li><p>Difficulty completing responsibilities like chores, bills, homework, etc.</p> </li> <li><p>Trouble taking turns, waiting in line, or otherwise being patient</p> </li> </ul><p>Together, these symptoms can sometimes make others think a person with ADHD is lazy, irresponsible, unreliable, and/or uninvested in their own success. They may be seen as underperforming in school or at work and may experience ongoing stress, feelings of frustration, guilt, blame, and/or worry because of goals or responsibilities that aren’t being met. </p><p>No one likes boring tasks, but for a person with ADHD, these tasks may feel unbearable. For many with ADHD, their ability to hyperfocus may let them accomplish massive amounts of highly focused work for long periods of time on something they’re interested in. </p><p>They may get so intense that they forget to do things like eat or use the restroom during this time. However, if the same person is handed a task they find dull, it may feel impossible to complete no matter how seemingly simple or quick the task might be. </p><p>The best way I’ve seen ADHD described is that, while most people are walking on land, those with untreated ADHD are wading through three feet of water while being expected to progress at exactly the same pace. It’s not always impossible, but it is unsustainable, exhausting, and eventually will lead to failure no matter how hard you try. </p><p>If you believe you or a loved one may have ADHD, it can be life-changing to get a diagnosis, so you can find the treatment and coping skills that are right for you. </p><h2>Who can have ADHD?</h2><figure><img title="Kali9 / E+ via Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1p57Ui_a_teacher_using_a_tablet_computer_to_education_two_small_students.jpg" alt="A teacher using a tablet computer to education two small students."><figcaption><em>ADHD is not limited to one single age group or gender.. Kali9 / E+ via Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone of any age can have ADHD. While some people grow out of the worst of their symptoms as they age into adulthood, for many, the condition is a lifelong companion. </p><p>When asked to imagine someone with ADHD, many people think of a young, white boy because that’s historically the group that’s most directly associated with the term. However, research published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and CHADD suggests this disparity may be caused by racial and gender bias rather than an actual measure of prevalence within that population. </p><p>For instance, as children, girls are diagnosed with ADHD half as often as boys, but by the time they are adults, the numbers are roughly even. Some suggest this is because girls are held to stricter standards with their behavior when it comes to following social customs like sitting still. Others blame the fact that in many girls, the inattentive symptoms of ADHD show up stronger than hyperactivity, making it harder to identify. </p><p>The neurodivergence resource ADDitude also suggests ADHD is often underdiagnosed among those who are Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, and/or Indigenous. This underdiagnosis can stem from medical bias as well as the unconscious bias of authority figures like teachers and counselors. </p><p>Much like with women, stereotypes and pre-existing notions of how a non-white child or adult might act can impact whether a person is seen as having a genuine medical need versus just “misbehaving.” Other reasons why these groups may be underdiagnosed include mental health stigma and medical mistrust based on past community trauma. </p><p>If you believe you may have ADHD, but you don’t fit the stereotypical image of how a white boy might exhibit symptoms, it might help to research the ways your specific identities experience the condition. </p><p>For instance, one reason I went so long without being diagnosed is because I did well in school. Never mind that it often took me two to three times as much effort to achieve the same results as my peers, or that the self-imposed stress of it all led to frequent burnout and meltdowns. My grades were good, and my behavior wasn’t disruptive, so I successfully fooled every adult around me into believing I was “normal.”  </p><p>Remember that no one is “too old” to have ADHD. An NIH brochure points out that getting diagnosed as an adult is common, particularly in the underdiagnosed groups listed above. As someone who wasn’t diagnosed until their mid 20s, I can say from experience that getting an answer quickly is important. The only regret I have about my diagnosis is that I didn’t know to ask about my ADHD symptoms sooner. </p><h2>Is ADHD genetic?</h2><p>As the CDC points out, genetics play a huge role in determining the likelihood of having ADHD. Though there is no official “ADHD gene” or any other physical indication of ADHD, there is strong evidence that ADHD runs in families. What’s particularly interesting about this pattern is that a lack of family history doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t have ADHD—it might just mean you’re the first one to get diagnosed. </p><p>For instance, on one side of my family, I was the first person to get diagnosed with ADHD. Within one year, two of my cousins also sought testing and were found to have it as well. Though many of the older members of my family have chosen not to get officially tested, we’re all fairly confident they might also have it. </p><p>This discovery of lineage is extremely common in those with ADHD. Many times, parents will learn they have it as they help their children get diagnosed and realize how many symptoms and traits they themselves experience. For this reason, it can be helpful to share your diagnosis with your family when you feel comfortable doing so, as it might help them seek the help they need, too. </p><h3>Types of ADHD</h3><figure><img title="MarLei / iStock via Getty Images Plus" src="IMG/BB1p5dc5_three_silhouettes_of_people_with_different_symbols_in_place_of_their_brain.jpg" alt="Three silhouettes of people with different symbols in place of their brain."><figcaption><em>The types of ADHD include inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.. MarLei / iStock via Getty Images Plus</em></figcaption></figure><p>ADHD used to be split up between those who primarily show the hyperactive symptoms (ADHD) and those who primarily show the inattentive symptoms (ADD). However, in recent years, these separate diagnoses have been recategorized to all fall under the ADHD umbrella. Instead of being separate disorders, ADHD is now described as showing up in three different ways depending on the person’s most common symptoms: Inattentive, Hyperactive-impulsive, and Combined. </p><h3>Inattentive ADHD</h3><p>Inattentive presentation is characterized by the quieter side of ADHD symptoms. While a person who exhibits these symptoms may still show some elements of hyperactivity or impulsiveness, most of their symptoms fall into areas like the ones listed below. </p><ul> <li><p>Dislikes and avoids tasks that require sustained focus</p> </li> <li>Trouble staying organized </li> <li><p>Struggles with following through on instructions and completing tasks</p> </li> <li><p>Poor attention to detail and/or makes careless mistakes</p> </li> <li><p>Difficulty focusing on conversations and/or does not appear to listen</p> </li> <li><p>Easily distracted on a consistent basis</p> </li> <li><p>Forgets and loses things frequently</p> </li> </ul><h3>Hyperactive-impulsive ADHD</h3><p>Hyperactive-impulsive presentation is characterized by the more active and visible elements of the symptoms for ADHD. While a person who exhibits these symptoms may still show some elements of inattentiveness, most of their symptoms fall into areas like the ones listed below. </p><ul> <li><p>Frequent fidgeting (hands, feet, and/or whole body)</p> </li> <li><p>Trouble staying seated</p> </li> <li><p>Excessive talking</p> </li> <li><p>Restless and/or feeling driven by a motor</p> </li> <li><p>Difficulty focusing on quiet activities</p> </li> <li><p>Trouble waiting their turn or waiting in line</p> </li> <li><p>Inclination toward impulsivity</p> </li> <li><p>Interrupting often or missing social cues for when to speak/how to speak</p> </li> </ul><h3>Combined ADHD</h3><p>Those who experience a mix of symptoms between the above two categories are considered to have Combination Type (or “Combined Type”) ADHD. This is the most common way ADHD presents. </p><p>In other words, to anyone asking, “What is ADHD?”, the unfortunate reality is that this is a condition that can have very different meanings to different people. The symptoms of ADHD vary, but most folks with the condition find individualized ways to cope. The treatment section below sheds more light on this topic. </p><h2>ADHD and co-existing conditions</h2><p>The CDC suggests approximately 60% of people with ADHD have some type of coexisting condition. Coexisting conditions are not caused by ADHD, but they may change how the symptoms of ADHD present. There are also some coexisting conditions that are more commonly found in those who have ADHD, such as the ones below. </p><h3>Common coexisting conditions</h3><ul> <li><p>Depression</p> </li> <li>Anxiety disorders </li> <li>Learning disabilities like dyslexia and dyscalculia </li> <li><p>Substance abuse disorders</p> </li> <li><p>Eating disorders</p> </li> <li><p>Mood disorders</p> </li> <li><p>Disruptive behavior disorders</p> </li> <li><p>Tics and Tourette syndrome</p> </li> <li>Sleep disorders </li> <li>Autism </li> </ul><h3>ADHD and autism</h3><p>CHADD suggests ADHD is the most common coexisting condition for those who have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with European Child and Adolescent Psychology research estimating 30-80% of those with ASD also have ADHD. However, this does not mean the conditions coexist as strongly in the other direction. On the contrary, the same study determined that only around 20-50% of ADHD-diagnosed kids had ASD. </p><p>For those who have both ADHD and ASD (or as some like to call it, AuDHD), managing the dual symptoms may pose extra challenges. It’s a good idea to find a healthcare provider who specializes in the ways the two conditions work together (and against each other) to better understand coping strategies and treatment. </p><h2>Is ADHD a disability?</h2><p>"What is ADHD?” is a question that prompts many answers. One aspect of ADHD that’s undisputed is that it does qualify as a disability under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). This means the legal protections that exist within workplaces and schools for disabled people also protect people with ADHD. Because ADHD manifests differently for each person, some may never have a need for disability services, while others may find they need substantial accommodations. </p><p>It’s worth noting that ADHD is only considered a legal disability when officially diagnosed by a licensed medical professional. This documentation will be required for most requested accommodations. While choosing whether or not to disclose your ADHD is a very personal decision, in order to receive official accommodations covered by the ADA, you must disclose your ADHD. </p><h2>Treatments for ADHD</h2><figure><img title="Timnewman / iStock via Getty Images Plus" src="IMG/BB1p5kDR_three_open_bottles_of_pills_turned_over_to_scatter_different_types_of_pills_on_the_counter.jpg" alt="Three open bottles of pills turned over to scatter different types of pills on the counter."><figcaption><em>There are a variety of medications that can help curb the symptoms of ADHD and make daily routines more manageable.. Timnewman / iStock via Getty Images Plus</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few common ways ADHD is treated, though these vary depending on coexisting conditions that are present, how the ADHD symptoms show up for each individual, and how an individual responds to particular treatments. </p><p>Some of the most frequent ways ADHD is treated include: </p><ul> <li><p>Medications: Stimulants (such as Adderall and Ritalin) as well as non-stimulants (such as antidepressants)</p> </li> <li><p>Therapy: Mental health counseling, psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, etc.</p> </li> <li><p>Coaching: Working with a professional to develop skills and techniques for improving everyday life</p> </li> </ul><h2>How to get diagnosed with ADHD</h2><p>In order to be officially diagnosed with ADHD, you must visit a licensed mental health professional. There, you will be evaluated through a combination of tests and behavioral assessments. Others in your life will be asked questions about how you navigate daily activities. For children, this might mean asking teachers about a child’s behavior in class, and for adults it may mean asking family members, spouses, or roommates how you typically handle responsibility around the house. </p><h2 class="tbrn-article__related-content-title">Related content</h2><ul class="tbrn-article__related-content-list">     <li class="tbrn-article__related-content-item">                   <h4 class="tbrn-article__related-content-heading">                feature       </h4>               10 memory loss products that offer friendly reminders for daily activities           </li>     <li class="tbrn-article__related-content-item">      <figure><img title="Provided by Reviewed.com" src="IMG/AA1knoPq_adhd_planner_opened_to_showcase_colorful_calendar_page_on_top_of_wooden_surface.jpg" alt="ADHD planner opened to showcase colorful calendar page on top of wooden surface."><figcaption><em>ADHD planner opened to showcase colorful calendar page on top of wooden surface..
