    <main><h1>The 10 Best Foods for Menopause Symptoms</h1><h2>Berries</h2><p>Berries, including blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, are all low in calories and high in antioxidants, says dietitian and personal trainer Mary Sabat, R.D., C.P.T., founder of Body Designs by Mary. “[Berries] can help combat oxidative stress and support heart health during menopause.”</p><figure><img title="Berries" src="IMG/AA1jdPi9_berries.jpg" alt="Berries"><figcaption><em>Berries.

Sabat agrees and says these options are all rich in calcium and protein, which are essential for bone health. If you do not care for dairy products, look for other plant-based options like dark leafy green vegetables (e.g. collard greens, spinach, and turnips), oatmeal, and tofu.</p><h2>Fatty Fish</h2><p>If you are a pescatarian or just love eating seafood, then you are in luck. “Mackerel, salmon, and sardines not only provide protein, but they also include omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties and may help alleviate joint pain and mood swings during menopause,” says Sabat.</p><figure><img title="Fatty Fish" src="IMG/AA1jdYoG_fatty_fish.jpg" alt="Fatty Fish"><figcaption><em>Fatty Fish. lacaosa - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Foods with Vitamin D</h2><p>If you are doubling down on calcium-rich foods, you will also want to include Vitamin D-rich foods in your diet since Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Some Vitamin D-rich foods include beef liver, egg yolks, sardines, and tuna, writes Harvard Health. You can also shop for foods fortified with Vitamin D. There are great options like cereals, orange juice, pasta, and rice to choose from.</p><h2>Leafy Greens</h2><p>If you love green veggies, then load up. Sabat says, “Vegetables like kale and spinach provide not only protein, but also a variety of vitamins and minerals that support overall health during menopause.”</p><h2>Legumes</h2><p>Legumes like beans, chickpeas, and lentils are not only rich in protein, but also contain fiber, which can help with digestive issues that sometimes come up during menopause, shares Sabat.</p><h2>Nuts and Seeds</h2><p>If you love to snack on nuts, seeds, and trail mix, then make sure your mix includes almonds, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and walnuts. “[These] are high in healthy fats, phytoestrogens, and protein making them good choices for menopausal women,” notes Sabat.</p><figure><img title="Nuts and Seeds" src="IMG/AA1jdTOp_nuts_and_seeds.jpg" alt="Nuts and Seeds"><figcaption><em>Nuts and Seeds.

Sabat adds that protein is essential for bone health, hormone production, muscle health, and weight management, all of which can be affected during menopause. Sabat recommends focusing on lean meats that offer high-quality protein like chicken, fish, lean beef, and turkey. “They provide essential amino acids necessary for hormone production and muscle maintenance.” Plant-based protein options include foods like beans, lentils, and tofu. You can also look for plant-based protein supplements made of brown rice protein, pea protein, or pumpkin seed protein.</p><h2>Soy</h2><p>Soy products including soy milk contain phytoestrogens, which are plant compounds that mimic estrogen's effects in the body, explains Michael Green, MD, a board-certified OB/GYN at Winona. “These can help alleviate some menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness.”</p><figure><img title="Soy" src="IMG/AA1jdYoY_soy.jpg" alt="Soy"><figcaption><em>Soy. manusapon kasosod - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Tempeh and Tofu</h2><p>Even if you are not a vegan or vegetarian, you may want to consider incorporating tempeh or tofu into some of your meals during menopause. “These plant-based protein sources are also rich in phytoestrogens, which are compounds that can help balance hormone levels naturally,” mentions Sabat.</p></main>
