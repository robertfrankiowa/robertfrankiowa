However, they are less likely to seek professional help because of mistrust in medical systems and personnel. </p><p>The medical mistrust stems from alarming issues of the past, like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, and present, like the Black maternal health crisis. More than half (55 percent) of Black adults say they’ve had at least one of several negative experiences with health care providers. Some of the issues people reported include having to advocate for proper care or feeling like doctors didn’t take their pain seriously. For younger Black women between the ages of 18 and 49, it is even more common. The study says that 71 percent report having at least one of the seven negative experiences with routine health care.</p><p>This understandable medical mistrust is causing Black women to seek natural remedies for their uterus health. From diet and lifestyle changes to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine, there’s many ways to ensure optimal uterine health. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Uterine Fibroids </h2><p>Uterine fibroids one of the most common uterine health issues prevalent in women. Black women, however, are diagnosed with fibroids roughly three times as frequently as white women. They also develop them earlier in life and tend to experience larger and more numerous fibroids with more severe symptoms.</p><p>“Uterine fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) growths inside the uterus,” according to a fact sheet from Yale Medicine. “When uterine fibroids become too large, too numerous or start pressing against another organ, a woman might experience severe pelvic pain or abdominal swelling, discomfort during sex, heavy menstrual bleeding, problems when urinating or defecating, anemia due to blood loss and even infertility, miscarriages and other pregnancy complications.”</p><p>Nearly a quarter of Black women between the ages of 18 and 30 have uterine fibroids, and by age 35, that number increases to 60 percent. The University of Michigan study also reports that Black women are two to three times more likely to have recurring fibroids or suffer from complications. </p><p>While the statistics are daunting, there are many natural remedies for uterus health that Black women can do from the comfort of their own home. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Diet and Lifestyle Strategies </h3><p>Diet and lifestyle choices have a huge impact on health and wellness, especially in uterine health. By making the conscious decision to make certain changes, Black women can help reduce the risk and shrink existing fibroids. Establishing an exercise routine, adding vitamins and supplements in your diet, and practicing yoga are all helpful changes. Massage therapy, warm baths and hot compress are other things that Black women can implement to ease symptoms. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Herbal Remedies</h3><p>Herbal remedies, such as green tea and chasteberry, may help ease the pain from uterine fibroids. Although these remedies haven’t been statistically proven, the properties in the ingredients could aid in lessening endometriosis symptoms. For example, green tea’s ability to reduce inflammation and remove toxins from the body potentially reduces the size and number of fibroids. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Endometriosis </h2><p>Endometriosis is another common uterine health issue for women. An estimated one in 10 women have it, with many suffering anywhere from five to 10 years before a doctor diagnoses them. For Black women, who are living with the painful symptoms, this reality is worse. They are 50 percent less likely to be diagnosed compared to their white counterparts. </p><p>“Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus,” according to a report from the World Health Organization. “It can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant.”</p><p>Education and research can help women navigate this chronic inflammatory condition. Some of the symptoms include severe pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during intercourse, infertility and fatigue. For some women, natural remedies are there only chance at relief before a proper diagnosis. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Diet Changes</h3><p>Food and drinks play a big role in uterine health. By eating less inflammatory foods, such as diary products, fried foods and red meat, and incorporating more anti-inflammatory foods, like leafy greens, walnuts, berries and cherries, it is possible to reduce the symptoms. </p><p>Turmeric, ginger and green tea also have shown results in lessening the symptoms from endometriosis. </p><p>Some lifestyle additions also can serve as a natural remedy for uterus health. By incorporating heat, yoga and massages into daily habits, Black woman can reduce pelvic pain and treat cramping.</p>
