    <main><h1>Can Drinking Coffee With Lemon Juice Lead to Weight Loss?</h1><p> [table-of-contents] stripped </p><p>Step aside pumpkin spice lattes, there’s a new trendy caffeine concoction taking social media by storm. Rather than a sweet beverage in the a.m., TikTokers are making a sour drink by combining lemon and coffee for weight loss. </p><p>The hashtag #LemonCoffee is taking off on social media platforms (videos garnering over 16 million views continue to circulate). Those partaking in the trend seem to enjoy the sour cup with breakfast (note: not in place of a morning meal). Some videos show “before and after” photos of creators claiming to showcase changes in their physique prior- and post-drinking the sour cocktail. While the health benefits of lemon water have been studied for some time, a mixture of coffee and lemon, or rather coffee with lemon juice, seems to have less research to back it up. </p><figure><img title="Nadya So - Getty Images" src="IMG/AA1h1h3L_does_coffee_and_lemon_work_for_weight_loss.jpg" alt="Does Coffee and Lemon Work for Weight Loss?"><figcaption><em>Does lemon and coffee work for weight loss?

But, are there any facts behind this trend? And is it safe?</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts: </strong>Amy Lee, M.D., triple board-certified in internal medicine, medical nutrition, and obesity medicine; Casey Kelley, M.D., board-certified in family medicine; Niket Sonpal, M.D., internist; Mascha Davis, M.P.H., R.D.N.; Jenna Stangland, M.S., R.D.N.; Jim White, R.D.N., A.C.S.M.; and Keri Gans, M.S., R.D. </p><p>It’s important to note that “following trends like this [can] also lead to hyper fixation on food rules on fads which can lead to disordered eating rather than focusing on sustainable behavior change,” says Mascha Davis, M.P.H., R.D.N., registered dietitian nutritionist and author of <em>Eat Your Vitamins</em>.</p><p>This said, if you’re still curious about the coffee and lemon weight loss trend, experts explain what you need to know, below. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Lemon for weight loss</h2><p>Unfortunately, lemons, on their own, won’t lead to weight loss. But, Casey Kelley, M.D., board-certified in family medicine and the founder and medical director of Case Integrative Health, says adding lemon slices to water can promote proper hydration as a tasty, low-calorie drink.</p><p>“Hydration is key for weight loss and weight management,” Dr. Kelley says. “Many who struggle to drink enough water may find that water with lemon is more enjoyable, and helps them stay hydrated. Ultimately, while lemon water can be a part of a healthy routine, it probably won’t lead to weight loss on its own.”</p><p>While lemons may not be key for weight loss, the citrus has other benefits, like its vitamin C content. “One lemon provides 51% of the daily recommended intake of vitamin C, an important nutrient for immune health,” Davis says. “While lemons alone aren’t a magic fat-burning food, they are low calorie, making them a great choice to add to dishes or drinks for extra flavor without added sugars, salt, or fats.”</p><p>The high level of antioxidants from vitamin C in lemons may help with oxidative stress related to exercise and inflammation, which can prevent weight gain, says Amy Lee, M.D., triple board certified in internal medicine, medical nutrition, and obesity medicine, and chief medical officer at Lindora Clinic. One study found that individuals with proper levels of vitamin C oxidize 30% more fat during exercise than those with lower levels. </p><p>Citrus juice can also improve some of the body’s functions, Jim White, R.D.N., A.C.S.M., exercise physiologist and the owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios, says, “Lemon juice can enhance the production of hydrochloric acid within the body which can help aid in digestion and nutrient absorption.”</p><p>And lemon juice, in particular, may help with digestive issues, as the sour taste stimulates the production of bile and gastric juices, Jenna Stangland, M.S., R.D.N., board-certified sports nutritionist and specialist in sports dietetics with Momentous suggests. “This, in turn, helps reduce gas formation and reduce bloating and indigestion,” she says. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Coffee for weight loss</h2><p>Caffeine is known for suppressing appetites, but that does not mean you should be replacing meals with a cup of coffee. Our bodies need food for fuel, and eating too few calories can slow down your metabolism, making it harder to lose weight. “Skipping meals by drinking coffee may contribute to higher levels of hunger and subsequent overeating later on,” Davis adds. “Excessive caffeine intake also leads to dehydration and poor sleeping patterns, which aren’t optimal for weight loss.”</p><p>As long as you are pairing your morning cup of coffee (with or without lemon) with a healthy breakfast, coffee may help weight loss. Keri Gans, M.S., R.D., author of <em>The Small Change Diet</em>, says there is <em>some</em> research that found drinking more caffeine can lead to a small reduction in long-term weight gain, which can be useful for someone attempting to maintain their current weight—not for losing weight.</p><p>Caffeine is also a diuretic, which means drinking coffee increases how much you urinate. According to the Mayo Clinic, diuretics lower fluid buildup in the body. This may lead to a temporary or short-term loss in weight because peeing more reduces water weight. But, it’s not sustainable. </p><p>One study showed that coffee can increase metabolism short-term and thermogenesis, which is the heat production as a by-product of metabolic processes, but further research is needed. “Unfortunately for us and for Starbucks, this has not panned out in real human studies,” Dr. Sonpal says. “People think it helps with weight loss, mostly because it stimulates bowel movements and so after you make your deposit in the restroom you ‘feel lighter.’”</p><p>But hitting the gym to burn some calories and boost your metabolism should contribute to weight loss, and a cup of coffee may give you the energy you need to do so. “Caffeine also has the potential to make you feel more awake, and may boost your performance in the gym,” Dr. Kelley says. </p><p>Coffee has additional health benefits, including protection against type 2 diabetes, decreased risk of some cancers, lower risk of heart failure, and a significant reduction in the risk of death from chronic liver disease, White says. Coffee is also packed with antioxidant properties, which can lower your risk of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Can lemon and coffee lead to weight loss?</h2><p class="body-text">Unfortunately, probably not. “It’s unlikely that this drink alone is the magic solution to weight loss,” says Davis. It may help to provide a small boost of vitamin C and some energy from the caffeine, Davis notes, but ultimately isn’t a magic drink for weight loss.</p><p>Niket Sonpal, M.D., internist and assistant professor at Touro College of Medicine agrees. “Most of the anecdotal evidence is because people will start a massive health kick they learn on social media, which is mostly diet and exercise, combined with water and lemon juice,” Dr. Sonpal says. “It’s the diet and exercise helping, not the lemons.” </p><p>While there seems to be no clear connection between lemon coffee and weight loss, White compares this trend to the popular notion that drinking lemon water can help you lose pounds. But the culprit may really be proper hydration more than anything else. “The concept is the same, drinking liquid naturally fills your stomach, keeping you fuller longer, thus diminishing cues that make you want to eat,” he says. “Coffee also has an appetite suppressing effect which can limit the amount of calories consumed.”</p><h2 class="body-h2">Are lemon and coffee safe to drink together?</h2><p>For the most part, there’s no danger in adding some lemon to your coffee. But, there are some side effects of lemon and coffee to consider. Stangland says you may experience the following after drinking the sour beverage:</p><ul><li>Heartburn</li><li>Stomach discomfort</li><li>Wearing away of tooth enamel</li><li>Staining of teeth</li></ul><h2 class="body-h2">Are there benefits to drinking lemon and coffee?</h2><p>Dr. Lee says there are some minor benefits from consuming lemon and coffee (note: the benefits you’d reap from consuming each individually), but the key to losing weight is what you do in addition to drinking the two together. “There should be a general healthier eating plan, exercise, and lifestyle change,” Dr. Lee says. “Drinking instant coffee with lemon juice alone would not show significant fat burn.”</p><p>As for the combination: “I wouldn’t expect any additional health benefits in one’s coffee with lemon juice since the actual amount of vitamin C in a serving would be minimal,” Gans says. Instead, you’re better off eating foods with more vitamin C, such as oranges, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and other citrus fruits. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Sustainable weight loss tips</h2><p>Weight loss typically requires a calorie deficit, whether that’s from eating fewer calories or upping your physical activity. Davis says to focus more on the nutritional value of what you’re consuming. “If someone wishes to consume [lemon and coffee], I’d recommend pairing it with a filling, high-protein breakfast to provide your body with substantial nutrition,” Davis says.</p><p>Davis strongly suggests not centering your nutritional choices around diet trends. “While these trends may offer short-term results, it’s crucial to recognize that sustainable progress relies on establishing foundational behavior changes that you can maintain over the long term,” she says. “Simply following the latest diet craze or weight-loss fad often leads to a cycle of losing and regaining weight, which can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health.”</p><p>So, what should you do instead? “If someone is looking to lose weight I would recommend a Mediterranean style of eating and the expertise of a registered dietitian nutritionist,” Gans says. A Mediterranean diet can help lower levels of weight gain.</p><p>Dr. Kelley says weight loss is a gradual process that requires patience, persistence, and long-term lifestyle changes. “Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine and focus on activities you enjoy to make exercise a sustainable habit,” Dr. Kelley says.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s always best to do some research on any weight loss fads or nutritional trends you see on social media. If you’re looking to lose weight, speaking to a registered dietitian, increasing your physical activity, and following a healthy diet can help you meet your goals. </p><p><em>If you believe you are struggling with an eating disorder and need support, call the </em><em>National Eating Disorders Association helpline</em><em> at (800) 931-2237.
