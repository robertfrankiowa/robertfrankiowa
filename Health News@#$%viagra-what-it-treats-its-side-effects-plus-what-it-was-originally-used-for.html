    <main><h1>Viagra: What It Treats & Its Side Effects ( Plus What It Was Originally Used For)</h1><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">What Is Viagra?</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">Viagra is a medication for ED that can help adult men of all ages. This prescription drug is taken as needed to get and maintain hard during intimacy. As long as it’s used as directed, it’s considered safe and effective.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">What Is Viagra/Sildenafil Used For?</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">What is sildenafil used for? Generic sildenafil (and brand-name Viagra) is a medication for the treatment of ED, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">To understand how Viagra works, we need to look at ED briefly.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">The muscles regulating blood flow and supporting staying hard after stimulation can sometimes malfunction. This is thanks to an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Viagra inhibits PDE5 and acts as a vasodilator (something that dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow). </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">A single tablet of sildenafil can do that — typically, one dose is all that’s required to produce a firmer, longer-lasting hardness. Studies have shown a 70 to 80 percent success rate in patients who use this treatment.</p><h2>What Was Sildenafil Used for Originally?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Since 1998, the Pfizer-created drug sildenafil citrate has been a reliable treatment for the management of ED. But the active ingredient began its clinical journey as a medication intended to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina (chest pain due to high blood pressure).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Sildenafil can still be used to treat hypertension, but today, the primary use of this PDE5 inhibitor is to remedy ED. Other first-line treatment options for blood pressure and heart disease are now considered before Viagra.</p><figure><img title="What Was Sildenafil Used for Originally?" src="IMG/AA1ns64Q_what_was_sildenafil_used_for_originally.jpg" alt="What Was Sildenafil Used for Originally?"><figcaption><em>What Was Sildenafil Used for Originally?. samael334/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Benefits of Viagra: What Does Sildenafil Do for Men?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Plenty of claims have been made about the health benefits of Viagra for men. Sildenafil’s ability to increase blood flow makes the medication useful for managing other conditions.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Some sources suggest Viagra might make you last longer in bed, and others say it’s good for heart health. But while this medication can help with the management of ED, it’s not a one-stop shop for every improvement you’d like to achieve.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">With that in mind, you should know that Viagra won’t increase privates size, it may not boost your drive, and it hasn’t really been shown to prevent tiredness during intimacy. We’re not just saying that, either — a study on 60 men confirmed this.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Not all claims about Viagra have been supported by enough science to convince us — let alone the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) — of their validity.</p><figure><img title="Benefits of Viagra: What Does Sildenafil Do for Men?" src="IMG/AA1nrWNK_benefits_of_viagra_what_does_sildenafil_do_for_men.jpg" alt="Benefits of Viagra: What Does Sildenafil Do for Men?"><figcaption><em>Benefits of Viagra: What Does Sildenafil Do for Men?. Prostock-Studio/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>What’s Viagra Used for Other Than ED?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">There are a few other potential uses for sildenafil.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra might help with:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Pulmonary arterial hypertension</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Mountain sickness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Raynaud’s phenomenon</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Heart disease</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Below, we’ll explain the different sildenafil uses and how the medication might affect people with these conditions.</p><h2>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious condition that happens when the tiny vessels in your lungs narrow, resulting in high blood pressure.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Normally, the pulmonary artery supplies oxygen-filled blood from the lungs to the heart. But with this condition, the arteries are blocked, narrowed, or even destroyed, preventing healthy blood flow.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">When that happens, blood pressure in the lungs increases, and the heart has to work harder to get blood through those tiny arteries — a process that can eventually tire out the lungs, potentially causing heart failure.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra can help reduce blood pressure in the lungs within its role as a vasodilator — essentially, it can do for your lungs what it does for your privates. Sildenafil lowers blood pressure in the lungs so the heart doesn’t have to work as hard to pump blood away.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">In a study comparing the effects of sildenafil and bosentan (a popular drug for managing PAH), sildenafil was found to be just as effective in managing the condition when combined with other therapies, like diuretics.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Sildenafil for managing PAH is marketed under the name Revatio with a particular dosage. It’s one of several FDA-approved treatments for the condition.</p><h2>Mountain Sickness</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Beyond a massive adrenaline rush, mountain climbing can come with a bout of altitude sickness, sometimes called mountain sickness.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Some reports say that since Viagra can widen blood vessels, it can increase blood flow through the heart, permitting more oxygen to the lungs and improving oxygen supply to the rest of the body.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">One study tested this theory in ten cyclists riding at a high altitude. The medication was found to improve heart function and blood oxygen levels. It also enhanced performance levels in some participants.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">That said, ten cyclists is hardly enough to convince us (let alone the FDA) to approve something as a treatment.</p><h2>Raynaud’s Phenomenon</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">During a Raynaud’s phenomenon (sometimes called a Raynaud’s attack), blood flow to the hands and feet is reduced. This makes them feel numb and cold.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Episodes can happen when you’re exposed to cold temperatures or are under emotional stress.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Raynaud’s phenomenon is usually more annoying than serious — although severe (and rare) cases can lead to tissue death in the hands or feet, which could require amputation.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra’s ability to decrease the number of attacks in people affected by the phenomenon was confirmed in a small study. Participants started off on 100 milligrams of sildenafil for three days before moving on to 200 milligrams for two days. The medication seemed to treat the condition and was well tolerated.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra is definitely not an appropriate first-line treatment for Raynaud’s phenomenon, but in situations where more common medications have failed, it could be an option.</p><h2>Heart Disease</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">One of the most common forms of heart failure happens when the left heart ventricle (responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body) can’t effectively do its job. This causes blood to back up into the lungs, which can lead to fluid buildup.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">In at least one study, regular long-term use of sildenafil was shown to improve left ventricle function while strengthening the structure of a failing left ventricle.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Sildenafil’s role as a PDE5 inhibitor might help prevent the thickening of heart muscles, a feature that makes it difficult to pump blood. Viagra has also shown real promise for increasing the amount of blood pumped by the heart, but more research is needed.</p><h2>Side Effects of Viagra Use</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Like any medication, side effects of Viagra may come with its many benefits. Still, Viagra is safe when used as directed.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra may cause common side effects, including:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Flushing</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Nasal congestion</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Headaches</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Back pain and other body aches</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Indigestion (upset stomach or constipation)</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">These are usually mild and often go away over time. Not sure if something is a side effect of Viagra? </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">What you really need to watch out for are the more serious side effects, which may include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Eye problems, like blurred vision, retinitis pigmentosa, or vision loss</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Chest pain</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Loss of hearing</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Priapism</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Sildenafil could also cause an increased risk of heart attack or other heart problems.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">If you have an irregular heartbeat, hearing loss, vision loss, an allergic reaction, Peyronie’s disease, or sickle cell anemia, or are being treated for leukemia or other medical conditions, share this with your healthcare provider.</p><h2>Sildenafil Drug Interactions</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">A word on sildenafil drug interactions: Mixing antihypertensive prescription drugs (hypertension meds) with Viagra may cause low blood pressure. Since the medication has blood pressure-lowering abilities, pairing it with another drug that reduces blood pressure could lead to a dangerous or potentially fatal drop in blood pressure.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Likewise, Viagra shouldn’t be combined with antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS, as it can cause an increased concentration of sildenafil in the body. Breastfeeding women shouldn’t take this medication, either.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Other medications that could cause sildenafil drug interactions include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Riociguat</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Saquinavir</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Antifungals (like itraconazole or ketoconazole)</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Antibiotics (like erythromycin)</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Because of the risks of this medication, people taking alpha-blockers, over-the-counter nitrate supplements (like amyl nitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, or nitroglycerin) or recreational drugs (like “poppers”) should tell a healthcare professional before taking Viagra.</p><figure><img title="Sildenafil Drug Interactions" src="IMG/BB1pvSdF_sildenafil_drug_interactions.jpg" alt="Sildenafil Drug Interactions"><figcaption><em>Sildenafil Drug Interactions. samael334/Istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Does Viagra Take to Work?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra usually starts working 30 to 60 minutes after taking it. But simply swallowing the little blue pill won’t automatically make you hard — you still have to be aroused, either through mental or physical stimulation.</p><h3 class="sc-193c53f9-2 gNyDQM">Can You Make Viagra Work Faster?</h3><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Some guys might feel the effects of Viagra faster when they take the pill on an empty stomach. Taking it with food, particularly high-fat foods like a burger and fries, can slow it down or even make it less effective.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Stendra (avanafil) is a faster-acting ED medication. This one can start working just 15 minutes after you take it.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">This medication works for about four hours. So after taking Viagra, you should be able to get and maintain being hard enough (again, with stimulation) within that window. </p><h2>What Is Viagra for Men?: Takeaways</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra has made its way into medicine cabinets the world over as a trusted medication for ED and cardiovascular health. We know intimate activity is supposed to be somewhat off the cuff, but you still shouldn’t take it with abandon. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Using Viagra only as directed by a healthcare provider is vital for avoiding many potentially dangerous side effects that can occur when you go off-script with your prescription.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Interested in trying Viagra? Here are the most important things to know:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Viagra is a proven treatment for ED. While it may not do anything for your intimate experience in terms of libido, it can have incredible effects if you’re having problems getting hard and maintaining it.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">It’s not the only ED med. Other medications for ED, like Cialis (tadalafil), Levitra (vardenafil), and Stendra (avanafil), may also help.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ fUZbJn">Follow the guidance of a medical professional. Always consult a trusted healthcare professional for medical advice on the best ways to use this drug — and let them know about any other meds or supplements you’re taking.</p></li></ul><figure><img title="What Is Viagra for Men?: Takeaways" src="IMG/BB1pvKOR_what_is_viagra_for_men_takeaways.jpg" alt="What Is Viagra for Men?: Takeaways"><figcaption><em>What Is Viagra for Men?: Takeaways. stefanamer/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure></main>
