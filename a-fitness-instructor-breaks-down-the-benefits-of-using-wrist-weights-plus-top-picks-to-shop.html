    <main><h1>A fitness instructor breaks down the benefits of using wrist weights — plus, top picks to shop</h1><p><em>Shop TODAY independently determines what we cover and recommend.

Whether you’re doing Pilates, yoga, cardio, strength or taking a stroll, wrist and ankle weights are a hands-free way to feel the burn. Another perk? They don’t take up much space in your bag or home gym.</p><p>But as you know, there are dozens of options on the market. That's where I come in. I used my experience as a certified personal trainer, spin instructor and yoga teacher; tapped my peers; and spent hours researching and poring over dozens of reviews on some of the highest-rated weights in the market. Use the links below to get my professional advice, answers to your top questions, and of course, my top picks.</p><p><strong>Benefits of wrist weights</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Benefits of ankle weights </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Before you start</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Top options to shop</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>How we chose</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Meet our expert</strong></p><h2>What are the benefits of wrist weights?</h2><p>Using wrist weights while exercising improves upper body strength and, maybe more surprising, your cardiovascular health. Studies show that walking with handheld weights or wrist weights increases your oxygen uptake (how much oxygen you’re able to take in) and heart rate, compared to walking without weights. The short of it: Exercising with wrist weights leads to greater calories expended (read: burned). Just be sure to show your wrists some love to prevent injury.</p><p>Personally, I love adding wrist weights to shadow boxing workouts, arm movements and core exercises — exercises you do with a high number of reps using light weights, versus those performed with a low number of reps using heavy weights.</p><p>Eliza Shirazi, founder of fitness website Kick It By Eliza, feels the same. “There are so many benefits to adding light weights (like well-fitting wrist weights) to cardio workouts, but my favorite reason is that you are building muscle endurance ... building stamina and improving our cardiovascular health" thanks to the added resistance, she explains.</p><h2>What are the benefits of ankle weights?</h2><p>Ankle weights offer plenty of benefits, especially when it comes to building strength in the lower extremities. Using ankle weights for exercises like leg raises, donkey kicks and even some cardio exercises can help increase muscle mass and improve balance.</p><p>Notable studies regarding ankle weights show significant benefits in older populations (though all of us can take notes here). One study of nearly 100 participants aged 66 to 76 years showed significant increases in lower-limb circumference (i.e., muscle mass) after three months of wearing ankle weights, for at least two 20-minute outdoor walks per week.</p><p>Another study of healthy older women showed that using a resistance band and wearing ankle weights three times per week for three months achieved significant improvement in lower body strength and mobility.</p><h2>Before you start with ankle and wrist weights, a note of caution</h2><p>Muscle imbalances occur when we repeat the same exercises often without training other areas of the body; these can then cause aches, pains and injuries to the joints (specifically knees and hips) and your back.</p><p>For example, wearing wrist weights while walking and pumping your arms — without also training muscles in the shoulders, triceps, biceps, back and core — might cause an imbalance.</p><p>Similarly, walking with ankle weights requires the quadriceps to work harder than the hamstrings. Doing so regularly without also training every other muscle in your legs movements can also cause muscle imbalances in the lower body.</p><p>So make sure to prioritize supplemental training to other parts of your body once you decide to start using ankle and wrist weights.</p><h2>Best ankle and wrist weights to shop, according to editors and shoppers</h2><h3><strong>Henkelion Adjustable Ankle Weights</strong> </h3><p>Adjustable Ankle Weights</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Neoprene, cotton, Velcro <strong>| Weight:</strong> 1-2.5 lb. each <strong>| Length of each band: </strong>13-14.4 in. <strong>| Accessories included:</strong> Reflective strips</p><p>With a glowing five-star rating from over 10,000 Amazon shoppers, these ankle weights from Henkelion come in five fun colors and three different weight variants (two, three and five total pounds). They’re also made with a moisture-wicking premium neoprene-cotton blend and have removable sand bags if you’d like to customize how easy or difficult you’d like your cardio to be.</p><p>"When it comes to fitness gear, I like to stick to the basics: dumbbells, resistance bands, a yoga mat I can use again and again, and ankle weights. And as far as ankle weights go, these fit the bill -- they’re nothing fancy, but they work!" shares partnerships editorial assistant Erica Marrison. "My favorite feature is that they are held on by a strong velcro, as opposed to a double ring buckle, which I’ve tried in the past and didn’t love because they were always coming undone and slipping off. Plus, the price point on these is great and they can easily be stored, which is key for small space living."</p><h3><strong>Bala Bangles</strong> </h3><p>Bangles</p><p><strong>Material:</strong> Silicone-wrapped steel <strong>| Weight:</strong> 1 lb. each <strong>| Length of each band: </strong>13 in. <strong>| Accessories included:</strong> Color-matched carrying case</p><p>There are no other ankle weights that are trendier and cooler-looking than the Bala Bangles. These babies can be worn on your wrists or ankles, come in an array of fun colors like Blush, Sage and Sea, and are only one pound each (though you can buy a set of two pounds each, too).</p><p>One fun fact: Though they’re not meant to be waterproof, a lot of customers do use them for water activities “without any issues,” according to Bala’s reps. </p><p>"I’ve had these for years and recently picked them back up for some at-home workouts and have been loving having them in my routine again," says editor Vivien Moon. "They’re lightweight enough that you don’t feel it at first but with repetitive movement, that little bit of added resistance adds up. I love how easy they are to put on and that they stay on snug so that no matter what exercise I’m doing, they’re not getting in the way or distracting me. They also double as ankle weights which is an added bonus." </p><figure><img title="Courtesy of Vivien Moon, Shop TODAY Editor" src="IMG/BB1oFtGy_courtesy_of_vivien_moon_shop_today_editor.jpg" alt="Courtesy of Vivien Moon, Shop TODAY Editor"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Vivien Moon, Shop TODAY Editor.
