    <meta name="description" content="Uterine is one of the most common forms of cancer, especially for women post-menopause. There are two types: the rare uterine sarcoma (that develops in the muscle walls of the uterus), and endometrial cancer (that develops in the uterine lining).

    <main><h1>7 Signs of Uterine Cancer Every Woman Should Know</h1><h2>Pelvic Pain</h2><p>Pelvic pain may come as the cancer enlarges or spreads into the abdomen or pelvis. Sometimes, the body recognizes the tumor as something foreign and cramps up to try to get rid of it. The pain can be constant, come in waves, or show up during vaginal penetration if there's pressure put on the uterus. Some patients feel a sharp pain, while others feel a minor discomfort. Pain may also occur in the lower back and legs in advanced stages.</p><figure><img title="Pelvic Pain" src="IMG/BB1p7oRz_pelvic_pain.jpg" alt="Pelvic Pain"><figcaption><em>Pelvic Pain.

There, it can cut off parts of the bowel and disrupt the movement of stool in the intestines. This can result in constipation, diarrhea, pain in the abdomen, and feeling full after eating less than usual. </p><figure><img title="Gastrointestinal Issues" src="IMG/BB1p7kcd_gastrointestinal_issues.jpg" alt="Gastrointestinal Issues"><figcaption><em>Gastrointestinal Issues.

This may make the belly feel hard and swollen. Sometimes, the tumor becomes large enough to cause swelling in that area. Bloating is also a sign of ovarian cancer.</p><figure><img title="Bloating" src="IMG/BB1p7qTB_bloating.jpg" alt="Bloating"><figcaption><em>Bloating.

Similarly, when the uterine cancer mass becomes large enough to flatten the bladder, there's an increased urge to urinate even when there's not much to expel. </p><figure><img title="Increased Urge To Pee" src="IMG/BB1p7mJv_increased_urge_to_pee.jpg" alt="Increased Urge To Pee"><figcaption><em>Increased Urge To Pee. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Unintentional Weight Loss</h2><p>Advanced uterine cancer can lead to unintended weight loss when the mass spreads to the abdomen. This makes the tumor press against the stomach and makes it feel full even after small amounts of food. Plus, weight loss can occur when advanced cancer causes inflammation that disrupts the metabolism and decreases appetite. </p><figure><img title="Unintentional Weight Loss" src="IMG/BB1p7qTD_unintentional_weight_loss.jpg" alt="Unintentional Weight Loss"><figcaption><em>Unintentional Weight Loss.

Others might feel unwell overall with no specific complaint. After all, the uterus easily expands to fit a fetus without significantly impacting other parts of the body, so it can also accommodate a tumor. </p><p>If you experience irregular vaginal bleeding or other symptoms of uterine cancer, speak to a medical care professional for a physical exam. They will prescribe a biopsy and/or ultrasound to look at the inside of the uterus if necessary. They may ask for your medical history to determine your level of risk for uterine cancer. Such factors include obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), taking estrogen without taking progesterone, diabetes, age 50+, ovarian diseases, no previous pregnancies, and early menstruation.</p></main>
