    <main><h1>43 Products For Anyone Who Hates Sweaty Thighs, Pits, Feet, Hands, And Faces</h1><h2>1.A pack of clinical-strength SweatBlock wipes could come in handy for hyperhidrosis, nervous sweating, and hormonal sweating any time of the year. But if summer really makes all that rear its ugly head, it's worth a try. You can apply it to your pits for bed and it's made to work for up to seven days. </h2><p>This stuff is STRONG so make sure you do a spot test first — especially if you have sensitive skin. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "For anyone who might be skeptical, please allow me to put you at ease. If you have hyperhidrosis, meaning it can be 9 degrees outside and you're still sweating under your arms, this product has the potential to change your life. I would sweat THROUGH a sport coat before noon. Enter the Sweat Block product. <strong>I've had it for three weeks and it is life changing. I DO NOT sweat under my arms anymore.</strong> I'm still on the original box that I bought three weeks ago. I had to write a review after I was cleaning the garage today in 85-degree heat. I was sweating through my shirt on my back — BUT NOT MY UNDERARMS. It is amazing!" —Frosty McGee</p><h2>2.Or a clinical-strength antiperspirant if you've tried just about everything to stop sweating but you haven't found your holy grail yet. It has 12% aluminum chloride, which blocks sweat for up to 72(!!) dry hours.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Just got inside from 80-degree weather. <strong>I CANNOT believe I have no sweat marks. To be dramatic, this is life-changing. To be modest, this is life changing.</strong> Haha. I was always so embarrassed going anywhere! No matter the weather I was always dripping sweat from under my arms. I was always so self-conscious, leaving parties early, known as the sweater! No more! I’m seriously so excited about this." —Liz</p><h2>3.Seamless bra liners to put underneath your bra to keep it from getting soaked by noon with sweat. Also, they'll put a bit of cushion between your underwire and skin for some extra comfort. </h2><p>FYI: They're machine-washable!</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65° outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! <strong>For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! </strong>To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you thank you thank you! Sincerely, all the grateful ta-tas you've helped to care for" —Niko</p><h2>4.A set of flower hair clips because you're tired of just a regular ole high ponytail you've been using to keep your hair off your sweaty neck thus far this summer. Prepare thyself for an onslaught of compliments.</h2><p>Check out a TikTok of the flower clips in action. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "So different and get a lot of compliments. They keep asking me where I got them. Use it wherever and holds my thick hair with no problem." —Bellap</p><p>"I love these claws clips! <strong>Not only are they functional, they are perfect accessories for any hairstyle. It has a strong clip and they are cartoony and fun.</strong> I love the way they are able to be used together and how the pastel colors look together. They are cute and I use them all the time. If you want to get such cute flower claw clips, they are perfect for you. <strong>I have no issues and they are beautiful, definitely a worthwhile purchase</strong>!" —Lauren Weathersby</p><h2>5.Kitsch's iconic claw clip if it's so hot that your brain can't compute an outfit that'll go with those flower clips. Psst, it also has specially rounded teeth to prevent hair damage.</h2><p>Kitsch is an LA-based, self-financed, woman-owned business established in 2010 that specializes in hair accessories. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Feels expensive. This hair clip works very well and also feels like a very high end item. It’s very sturdy and is a great, trendy replacement for plastic claw clips." —Mae</p><h2>6.A portable handheld fan that's also a power bank *and* flashlight. So you'll be sure to find all sorts of uses for it. </h2><p>Check out a TikTok of the portable fan in action. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This fan works so well, keeps me cool when I’m on the beach or sitting outside in the sun. The battery life is amazing but it takes a while to charge up." —Amanda Clerk</p><h2>7.Plus, a hands-free portable neck fan for those sweltering days on the beach when you just seem to be pouring sweat — even in the shade of the umbrella. Just be sure to charge it with the USB before you pack your beach bag!</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1n2gmf_reviewer_wearing_two_fans_connected_around_their_neck_to_blow_air_into_their_face.jpg" alt="Reviewer wearing two fans connected around their neck to blow air into their face"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>It has three speeds to choose from and also lights up, making you more visible at night. Reviewers note that you should definitely <strong>put your hair in a ponytail (but that it's easy to unsnag if it gets caught)</strong>. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "Took this to an all day, HOT day to a theme park. Charged it fully the night before and lasted through the whole day. Felt so cool. Plus at night you got the cool colors." —Paula</p><h2>8.Or, if you like your breeze with a side of mist, a misting fan because you may not be able to dip in a pool or take a cold shower rn. But you can use this!</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "In Arizona the summers are obviously brutal. Standing outside to wait for my daughter at school dismissal time is soooo much more pleasant with this fan. When it’s 115 outside (but it’s a dry heat😉) <strong>this fan is like a portable air conditioner</strong>. BONUS: The bottom reservoir is large enough to put ice cubes inside so it’s that much more comfortable. <strong>Fits in a standard car cupholder so you can easily transport it with you wherever you go.</strong> If you are comparing these types of spray fans, get this one. The battery compartment opens so easily and the fan blades are so flexible you won’t get injured if you touch them accidentally." —Meg A</p><h2>9.Plus, a battery-operated flexible rotating fan that lots of reviewers use on strollers to keep babies cool. But it'll attach to all sorts of places like car seats, treadmills, tents, or even your WFH area to create a nice breeze. </h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1oruig_a_black_version_resting_on_a_table_top.jpg" alt="A black version resting on a table top"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "We live in Florida and realized how badly we needed a fan for our newborn. We use it pretty much on a daily basis<strong>. We put it on her car seat and on her stroller when we go on walks. I’ve even propped it up on our desk when I’m working and holding our daughter. </strong>The three speeds are great: low usually offers just enough of a cool down and high is very impressive because it’s fast and quiet. The lights we didn’t really need but has been a nice feature to have. Our daughter hates going in her car seat and this helps to distract her sometimes. Plus, since we live in Florida we have to wait to go on walks until later in the day and the light lets us be seen easier. Overall, it’s a great and I’d definitely recommend!" —EmLe</p><h2>10.An I Dew Care "Tap Secret" mattifying powder shampoo can tackle greasy roots without the aerosol and benzene formula. I've been packing this for flights where I carry on only and this little puff is EFFECTIVE. Like, I went to New Orleans recently in late May with a blowout I was trying to make last. This kept my oily roots matte again! It's LEGIT. </h2><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA and it was so easy to use on the go.<strong> You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in.</strong> I do have black hair so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again." —Teresa</p><h2>11.A stick of Gold Bond Friction Defense that'll stop chafing caused by sweat before it even starts. It's sooo good and better than any other competitor in the thigh-saving category. But really. I have thick thighs and swear by it!</h2><p>My former colleague Ciera Velarde is a huge fan! Here's what she has to say: </p><p>"I've used it for about 12 years now and it's the only thing that I can trust to prevent that dreaded chafing after a sweaty day of walking around. It glides on perfectly, it's unscented, and it doesn't melt away when you start to sweat. If it's a particularly hot day out, it can start to fade after a few hours, so just make sure to bring it with you to reapply. In addition to preventing chafing between my thighs, I've also applied it on my arms where my sports bra rubs against them when I run and it works like a charm!"</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Whoooo sometimes I feel as if a fire is going to start between my fat thighs, but with this stuff they just glide right on by each other, it has been a summer lifesaver. Only thing is you have to pack it on and reapply maybe four hours in, so bring it along for the ride. I will be buying again." —Ash</p><h2>12.A pair of Thigh Society cooling shorts WITH a built-in pocket to save your inner thighs while you trek just about anywhere. Plus, they're super thin so they won't make you overheat. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "These are perfect for under dresses, even in the hot, humid summer. The pocket is perfect to slip my phone in so I can be hands-free. Great quality! I have two pairs, one black and one beige." —Amanda Martinez</p><h2>13.Or, a pair of straight-up bike shorts made out of wicking, quick-dry material if you've given up on wearing skirts or dresses. Don't worry, these won't leave you with butt sweat stains like other bike shorts!.</h2><p>Oh, and these have pockets! Reviewers say they love the high, supportive waistband and the compression fit that keeps them secure during movement.</p><p>SuperFit Hero is a woman-owned small business based in California specializing in premium plus-size activewear in sizes L–7XL.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I’ve had these for a while but have generally felt nervous about wearing skintight anything in public so I haven’t given them a real test. Today I said 'what the hell, you only live once' and wore them on a hike. They were SO GOOD! <strong>Super supportive, wicking, zero chafing, stayed put both on the waist and the leg, and laid flat under the waist belt of my pack. These shorts are the real deal</strong>. Just more confirmation that Superfit Hero is the place to go for serious athletic gear for larger bodies. I will definitely be hiking in them in the future!" —Mollie S.</p><h2>14.A cooling mattress pad reviewers rave about because it's truly awful to get ready for bed and then lie there, unable to sleep because you're too hot. This'll set you up for sleep success. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Unbeknownst to me, my wife decided to replace our mattress with the hardest slab of concrete on which I've ever had to sleep. I ordered this cover hoping for a tiny bit of relief. From the first night it exceeded all my hopes and dreams<strong>, I was able to sleep again, it doesn't slip off even with my tossing and turning, and it stays cool. </strong>This mattress cover probably saved my marriage. Thank you!" —michael ervin</p><h2>15.A silk pillowcase that have a soothing, cooling effect. But! These'll stick around in your bedding mix during cold weather, too, because silk doesn't suck moisture from your hair and skin like cotton pillowcases do. </h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I'm not one to usually write reviews, but I LOVE this pillowcase. It's easy to clean and it has helped my acne so much. Cloth pillowcases absorb oil and bacteria, this one has been helpful in controlling breakouts as well as being very cooling. If you get hot at night, I definitely recommend this pillowcase. It stays cool and you don't have to keep flipping over your pillow to the cool side with this pillowcase." —Patricia Upton</p><h2>16.A set of cooling towels you'll start taking with you everywhere this summer (and then, perhaps, in other seasons too). You simply wet one, wring it out a bit, and then drape it around your neck or anywhere else you run hot to experience its ~cooling~ super powers. </h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I saw these recommended on a TikTok for disabled people who can't regulate their temperature in the heat, and omg, was it worth buying them. You just add cold water and it's like an ice pack without the burning of the ice. They worked great for cooling my arm after the COVID shot! Excited to use them all summer!" —Muirgen Neal</p><h2>17.A set of popular wickaway sweatbands to rock during workouts, but maybe also just on days when you know you'll be outside awhile and suh-WEATING. </h2><p><strong>Promising review: "</strong>I wasn't certain if these would work for me or not. Since they aren't cotton, they're spandex, I thought they'd slip easily. You know what? They didn't. They not only didn't slip, but I love the colors. I love them so much I'm going to purchase the same style headbands from them but in different colors!" —Teresa T</p><h2>18.*Solid* Neutrogena SPF 50 sunscreen that'll really stick to your skin on your tropical (or just plain sweaty) vacation. Oh, and because it's a solid, it's carry-on–friendly!</h2><p>I first bought this for a weeklong Croatian vacation in 2021 when I did carry-on, and as long as you are *thoroughly* reapplying, this stuff stays on pretty well. On a beach club afternoon, I did haphazardly reapply and missed a strip on one arm, but I tend to do that with spray-on or lotion sunscreen, too.<strong> Since then, I've packed this for any trip I've been on</strong>, including a two-day Disneyland trip where I toted this around in my bag and shared with friends. I sometimes carry it with me in my purse on my everyday adventures because I know it's so easy to apply. Also worth mentioning...I am about the palest lady you've ever seen and swear by daily application of sunscreen. But when on a beach trip, I'm constantly swimming in the water and sweating. So yeah, this stuff works. </p><p>And if you're a bit hesitant about jumping on the solid sunscreen bandwagon, you can pack a stick of this, knowing you have enough sun protection to get you through to finding some spray-on or lotion SPF at your destination. </p><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"I bought this right before a Florida beach trip this month. Of course after a long winter, the Florida sun can be very intense and concerning. I use this on my face. It doesn’t break me out and has perfect coverage. Twice applied during a 3-hour beach outing, did not burn at all. After a few days of this routine, my face is perfectly bronzed." —Mflowers</p><h2>19.Carpe Antiperspirant Hand Lotion for anyone who suffers from constantly sweaty hands who REALLY notices it in the summer. It's recommended by dermatologists and the reviews are FULL of believers.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I’ve been pretty impressed with this cream. <strong>I have hyperhydrosis which mostly affects my hands and feet.</strong> I take an oral medication fort condition but I still have sweating sometimes which is why I decided to try this lotion. I’ve been using this product mostly on my feet about three times a week for a little over a month now. This cream has a slight smell but it’s nothing awful at all. I’ve noticed a little bit goes a long way. Before bed I put the cream on the bottoms on my feet. It doesn’t really leave any residue. <strong>It almost makes my feet instantly feel dry</strong>. I have definitely noticed that it helps maintain minimal sweating without any crazy side effects. I’ve also used this on my hands as well. This is a product that actually does help with my hyperhidrosis and I’ll definitely be ordering more when I run out!" —Lauren p.</p><h2>20.Lavilin Foot Deodorant Cream because you can't forget about your poor sweaty feet too! This sensitive skin-friendly formula is made to last up to seven days. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "If you have sweaty feet there is nothing on the market better than Lavilin. I've tried everything and this stuff is the only product that actually works. My feet use to sweat and smell. Not anymore!" —Tracker</p><h2>21.A hair finishing stick if you're going for that sleek look for your <em>quite</em> dirty hair you're rocking in a high pony for the day. This stuff is basically just a mascara wand you use to brush natural plant oils onto your hair to smooth down everything.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I have super fine hair with lots of breakage. No matter how I put my hair up I have bad flyaways. This stuff is great! <strong>So easy and it stays better and looks smoother than stiff hair spray.</strong>" —Jill Stilfield</p><h2>22.ONE/SIZE by Patrick Starr 'Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray in case you have a lot of requirements for your made-up look. Like, you wanna actually dip in the pool but stay looking matte while you lounge poolside beforehand. </h2><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"This setting spray locks my make up in, great for menopausal women too cause the makeup doesn't fade off. I sweat on my forehead and nose area and my makeup stays on all day." —shelop</p><h2>23.Or a NYX Matte Finish Makeup Setting spray can lock in your makeup (on the cheap!) to help avoid touchups throughout the day.</h2><p>I've tried tons of different setting sprays and keep going back to this one because it's affordable and works nearly as well as any luxury version I've tried. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Love this finishing spray! My makeup looks fresh all day long. I had never used a product to set my foundation before this one and I will never be without it again. If you like a soft matte finish, you will really like this product. Highly recommended." —BeBe Benz</p><h2>24.Kaia Naturals The Sweat Powder Sakura Blossom will pair well with natural deo in that it helps absorb sweat and keeps you smelling sweet throughout the day. It's especially great to travel with or throw in your gym bag. This talc-free formula is inspired by athletic chalk. </h2><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"I bought this on a whim. I have not been disappointed. It is great for extra freshness on a hot day. A gym bag must." —Anne D.</p><h2>25.Rimmel Stay Matte Mattifying Primer to give you a smooth finish that'll stay that way for so much longer.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This product works!!<strong> I have extremely oily skin which means my face is super shiny within minutes of applying foundation.</strong> The second photo is without primer, a few hours after applying foundation….you can see all the shine on my forehead. The first photo is with primer six hours after applying foundation….hardly any shine! I believe in the product so much that I gave a tube to my friend who also has oily skin and she absolutely loved it and uses it now! For the price, you can beat it compared to the expensive brands that are way more expensive and only a fraction of the size." —S. Rodriguez</p><h2>26.An ultra-fine continuous water mister can refresh your hair in the morning after you've slept on it. Let's keep that air-dry style looking fresh instead of using more time, water, and hair products on a whole wash!</h2><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"Used for wetting my 2-year-old's hair. Could have used it for crafts, could have used it for misting plants, so many things. It’s super durable, I know because she dropped it a million times. You don’t need to refill it every day, it doesn’t use a lot of water in each spritz but it does feel like it. Incredibly smooth. Would buy again (and I will because I left it at my sister's while traveling)." —Savannah</p><h2>27.A cooling body spray as a welcome relief for anyone who runs hot or just spends a lot of time outdoors. </h2><p>It's made with pure essential oils, water, and witch hazel.</p><p>Rooted Earth is a Maine-based small biz established in 2013 that specializes in small batch skin care and herbal apothecary goods. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "This spray is so lovely and refreshing! <strong>It smells fantastic, seems to be genuinely very high quality and helps so much with cooling off (I run hot and find heat stressful)</strong>. The packaging was also adorable and handmade, which made me feel like a valued customer :)." —April Wilson</p><h2>28.A CurlCap backless adjustable cap with plenty of room for your natural hair or updos while giving your face some extra shade.</h2><p>CurlCap is a Black-owned apparel company founded by Britney Sade that specializes in caps designed for natural hair with an open back and flexible scrunchie design. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "This hat is comfortable, well made, and cute! It is now my go-to hat for casual days when I put my hair in a ponytail. <strong>I have also worn it playing tennis and found that it's more comfortable than wearing a visor.</strong> The back elastic really keeps the hat secure without feeling too tight. I have the black twill, and would love to see it in other colors in this fabric for walking, running, and tennis. Love." —Me</p><h2>29.A Neutrogena makeup eraser stick can let you do a quick touch-up on that eyeliner wing that you can't get right or your sweat already smeared before it was set. And it's small enough that you can throw it in your bag on the reg. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Why didn’t someone think of this sooner? For years, I’ve been using cotton swabs dipped in makeup remover to remove little goofs or mistakes. This is so much better and portable! <strong>Erases waterproof mascara marks around my eyes easily. Must-buy product!!</strong>" —Katherine Riordan</p><h2>30.Kitsch Microfiber Hair Towel that'll gently sop up water while you go about your day. It's lightweight but hard working so you can get closer to either the dreaded hairdryer session or putting in some product and letting your hair finish by air-drying. </h2><p>I own this beaut in this pattern, a polka dot print, and a tropical leafy print. I swore by the Turbie Twist for awhile (which is closer to an actual towel) but this microfiber fabric is far gentler on hair. Plus it feels lighter on my head/neck, which is great news for someone like me taking lunchtime showers while working from home and putting off blow drying my hair for as long as possible. It has elastic along the edges that helps it wrap around my head comfortably, and a stretchy loop at the front that I can twist back and put on a large button at the back of my head. Suffice it to say, it's super user-friendly. I can easily throw it in the wash with the rest of my towels and hang it up on a bathroom door hook to let it dry between uses. I wish I bought three of these years ago. </p><h2>31.A sand removal bag will be SO handy for sweaty beach days. It's filled with talc-free, reef-friendly powder that'll help you brush off the scratchy stuff that you don't mind on the beach but would *like* to leave on the beach where you found it. </h2><p>See how it works on TikTok. </p><p>Shakalo is a San Diego-based small business started to figure out a way to help people, especially parents remove sand before leaving the beach. The soft fabric pouch allows the powder to remove the sand without scattering everywhere.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and <strong>it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1x–2x a week.</strong> I even use it on my dogs paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of. I will definitely be buying the refill and another bag to have exclusively in the car." —Gabbs Uresti</p><h2>32.Or a Coty Airspun Loose Face Powder in case sprays aren't your thing but you need something to keep the sweat off the beautiful masterpiece of your face.</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1n2i13_another_reviews_pic_with_perfect_makeup.jpg" alt="another review's pic with perfect makeup"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>I own, use, and love this. Plus, it's in a HUGE container and lasts for what feels like forever. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Great for baking (setting) under eye concealer (or concealer anywhere). <strong>Also, if I start sweating during my foundation application, I lightly dust this powder on my skin and the sweating not only stops then, but it will pretty much keep it at bay for the rest of the day.</strong></p><p>The powder does have a slight scent to it which doesn’t bother me however no one has told me that I smell like something different or powdery since I’ve been wearing it." —jillianmaxmillian</p><h2>33.Missha's Soft Finish Sun Milk packs in SPF 50+ protection no matter if you're sweating or even crying. (Hopefully tears of joy!) Reviewers especially love it for wearing with a full face of makeup. </h2><p>In the progression photos above, you can see a reviewer before applying the sun milk, after applying the sun milk, and then the sun milk under makeup.</p><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"I have dark, oily skin and purchased this product after reading recommendations. <strong>There is no white cast; you can barely see it upon application unless you use too much. </strong>You definitely do not need a lot, it spreads thin. When it dries, any color is gone. It also <strong>helps slow down my face getting all greasy as the day goes on</strong>, which I love. My skin is very, very oily but I can still apply this after my moisturizer and feel totally comfortable. I'm not a fan of scents, and the scent on this is extremely mild." —Ms. Renee</p><h2>34.Glossier Wowder to dull any shine and blur the look of pores without looking cakey or chalky as your finishing step. </h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1nehIs_jasmin_before_using_wowder_with_the_word.jpg" alt="Jasmin before using Wowder with the word"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>Check out all the deets from my colleague Jasmin Sandal: "I had been meaning to give this a whirl since its release a few years ago, and, boy, I don't know why I waited so long to snag it because this stuff has changed the game. I recently moved from New York to California and, let me tell you, with this change in climate, my skin has gone through every phase imaginable: Painfully flaky with patches of dryness, breakouts beyond belief, and shine, ooh, so much shine you'd think there had been an oil spill. (And I'm telling you all of this because no matter what I put on my face, makeup never sits on it quite like I want it to.) </p><p>"Enter Wowder — the pillowy-soft powder that has done the unthinkable: blurred my imperfections and sets my concealer without leaving a chalky residue. Now anytime I catch my reflection in the mirror I literally have to double take. <strong>My skin appears smoother and any fine lines look so much softer.</strong> A little goes a long way — and now I can leave my house with a little more confidence and return with a look that hasn't wavered."</p><p>Oh! And it's vegan and cruelty-free.</p><p><strong>Promising review: "</strong>I have pretty oily skin and I always look shiny by the end of the day. This setting powder left me with a matte finish that lasted all day. :)" —Sammy</p><h2>35.OC Eight Professional Professional Anti Shine Mattifying Gel can layer on underneath makeup to trap facial oils, reduce shine, and even out skin tone for ALL skin types for up to eight hours. (Cue the <em>Reba </em>theme song.) </h2><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"My face laughs at rice powder, oil blotters, and other paltry means. I decided to jump in head first and try it the first day with NO BASE MAKEUP AND NO POWDER. I did as was recommended on the box to apply and then moved on about my day. It doesn’t last eight hours. But I can tell you that it fully lasted four hours and after eight hours, my face was markedly less oily than it was without it. Which for someone who truly struggles with oily skin is a godsend. The pic is (from left) without oil control after about eight hours, then after I put it on this morning, then about four hours in and then about 10 hours in. 😱" —Crystal S. </p><h2>36.A packable floppy hat because just that little shade will make a big difference on your face. I can't be the only one who seems to POUR sweat from my head. </h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "Honey, this hat was giving me everything I needed it to give! <strong>I felt <em>Gone With The Wind </em>fabulous in this hat for my cruise vacation. It provided the adequate shade for my face and shoulders </strong>while allowing me to shade myself from people I didn’t want to talk to! Bay-bay! It was EVERYTHING I needed it to be <strong>AND the size XL fit over my braids. So my girls with protective styles or just big hair, this is the hat for you!</strong> 🎉" —1922blue</p><h2>37.An oscillating tower fan to help the air flow without REALLY jacking up your energy beel. It's a bladeless fan that works quietly with six speed options and a remote you can park on your nightstand in case you get a little too cold at night (what a great problem to have). </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "GO BUY THIS NOWWWWW!!! My room has been hot for over FIVE months now with no AC. Especially now with summer, I almost feel like I want to pass out. I’m so glad I got this. It’s been two hours now since we got it in the mail and our room has completely turned around from hot to freezing cold. I can’t believe I’m saying this. I have purchased over three fans the past few months and this one tops it all." —Inca</p><h2>38.Sweat-wicking pajamas made of viscose and spandex because, well, those Old Navy PJ pants from middle school that are still kicking are perf for cold weather, but you need something more breathable during summer months. Oh, and the waist is elastic!</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I'm a chronic night sweater living in a really hot New York City apartment — I'm so glad I invested in these. They are really soft and while I still have to kick off the sheets few times throughout the night (as usual), <strong>I feel much cooler than normal, and I stayed dry!</strong> I really am able to sleep much better." —Vanessa</p><h2>39.A set of affordable, highly popular *waterproof* wireless Bluetooth earbuds some reviewers compare to AirPods for significantly cheaper. Cheers to listening to your backlog of podcasts while sweating your butt off and staring at the ocean without worrying about said sweat messing up your earbuds.</h2><p>These come with a wireless charging case that provides up to 14 hours of charge (with the earbuds able to play for four-plus hours with each full charge). </p><p>I also use these on the reg in my everyday life to listen to Spotify and podcasts, and even talk on the phone. I have to charge them about once a week and always keep them in my coat pocket. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Best decision! <strong>These are the greatest headphones ever!</strong> I saw them on TikTok months ago and added them to my wishlist. I got a new phone that doesn't have the headphone port so I decided it was time to finally buy them. <strong>They are amazing and I probably won't ever take them out of my ears! </strong>😂" —Katlyn D Arnold</p><h2>40.But if you can't <em>bear </em>the thought of putting something else on your body, some “bust dust” anti-boob-sweat powder with soothing lavender and chamomile in a sprayable, talc-free formula to fight dampness and discomfort. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> “Lifesaver! I wear a very full D cup and this saves me during the summer months. Needless to say, the Florida heat is unrelenting and I cannot live without this Bust Dust. It definitely does the trick to keep my bra dry!” —wenb</p><h2>41.An inflatable lounge pool because it’s June. You’re sweaty. And you just wanna take a dip without getting in the car and driving somewhere to do it. (Besides, your snacks at home are superior to the community pool’s.) </h2><p>It's also got a bench and cup holders!</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I have had this pool for about two weeks now and I LOVE IT!!! <strong>Was simple to set up, I got a little electric pump and it took about 10 minutes to inflate, then about half an hour to fill with water. </strong>Pay attention to making sure you set it up on level ground or it will be lopsided. It is probably good for two adults, maybe one adult and a couple of kids. <strong>The built-in seat and headrest are really quite comfy and relaxing</strong>. I will definitely buy this same pool again if it springs a leak and can't be fixed, if I could give it a 10 stars I would. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!" —kathryn j.</p><h2>42.Plus, a flexible adjustable mister if the reason you haven't been reading on your deck is because of, simply, the heat. And because it's easily adjustable, you can take it with you as you move positions to avoid the sun. (Or embrace it?)</h2><p>The mister will cool the surrounding area by 20 degrees, and it comes with an interchangeable flower-shaped misting head for a fun, whimsy detail.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Works exactly how I want it to. <strong>Provides a fine, cool mist on the patio, allowing us to enjoy the backyard until sunset without breaking a sweat.</strong> Easy to set up. It was out of the box and cooling us off within minutes." —Debra L. Kusek</p><h2>43.And! A trampoline sprinkler that won't let the sweats keep you and your fam from enjoying the best thing about your backyard. </h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "This is awesome!!! Before we found this, the kids were using the hose to stay cool on the trampoline. The hose always turned into a fight — who got to hold it, someone getting sprayed in the face, etc. Now the kids can stay cool and fight about other things! Absolutely recommend this product as it was super easy to set up and makes for a fun way to cool down in the Arizona heat!" —Groveland</p><p><i>Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.</i></p></main>
