    <main><h1>7-Day No-Sugar, Anti-inflammatory Meal Plan for Weight Loss, Created by a Dietitian</h1><p>Trying to lose weight? Reducing inflammation may help.</p><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia</strong><p>If you have weight loss goals, you may be surprised to hear that it’s a bit more complicated than simple math. While calories in/calories out has long been touted as the simple weight-loss solution, we know that factors like chronic inflammation, lack of sleep, genetics, stress and hormones can impact body weight maintenance.</p><p>Chronic inflammation is a low-grade inflammatory response caused partly by environmental irritants, exposure to foreign compounds, extra body weight and lifestyle factors, such as long-term stress, an unhealthy diet and poor sleep quality. Symptoms of chronic inflammation are vague and hard to pinpoint. Still, its presence increases the risk of several health conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. </p><p>Even more so, chronic inflammation can make losing weight more difficult. Excessive weight can increase chronic inflammation and lead to leptin and insulin resistance, two conditions that make losing weight more difficult. So, if you want to lose weight, aiming to decrease chronic inflammation is a great place to start. Reducing stress, improving diet quality, eating more anti-inflammatory foods, exercising regularly and prioritizing sleep quality are all great steps to take to tame inflammation. </p><p>Additionally, though calories are not the only factor influencing body weight, aiming to decrease calories while filling up on plenty of protein and fiber can help assist weight loss efforts. We set this plan at 1,500 calories a day and included modifications for 1,200 and 2,000 calories per day for those with different calorie needs. As with all meal plans, this serves as a framework for a nutritious, anti-inflammatory eating plan. Feel free to swap a recipe, choose a different snack or make any changes that better fit your routine. </p><h2>Does Sugar Increase Inflammation? </h2><p>In this plan, we skip added sugars, which are added during processing to sweeten foods. Research has shown that excess added sugar intake may increase chronic inflammation. Additionally, most Americans consume more added sugar than they realize, with an average daily consumption of 17 teaspoons (68 grams). To put this into perspective, the American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugar intake to 6 teaspoons (24 grams) per day for women and 9 teaspoons (36 grams) per day for men.</p><p>However, we kept foods with naturally occurring sugars, such as fruit, vegetables and unsweetened dairy, which provide other nutrients such as minerals, vitamins and fiber. Additionally, you’ll find a week of delicious meals and snacks that include anti-inflammatory ingredients like beets, nuts, fish, avocado, dark leafy greens and berries. </p><h2>Anti-Inflammatory Foods to Focus On</h2><ul><li>Dark leafy greens (spinach, chard, collards, kale)</li><li>Orange vegetables, like sweet potato and winter squash</li><li>Beets</li><li>Cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts)</li><li>Berries</li><li>Avocado</li><li>Cherries</li><li>Citrus fruits</li><li>Plum</li><li>Pears</li><li>Apples</li><li>Olive oil and avocado oil</li><li>Nuts and seeds, including nut and seeds butters with no added sugar</li><li>Fish</li><li>Legumes</li><li>Whole grains (oats, quinoa, bulgur, freekeh and more)</li><li>Unsweetened dairy (yogurt, kefir)</li></ul><h2>How to Meal-Prep Your Week of Meals</h2><ol><li>Make Chicken & Spinach Salad with Creamy Feta Dressing to have for lunch on Days 2 through 5.</li><li>Prepare Peanut Butter-Oat Energy Balls to have as a snack throughout the week.</li></ol><h2>Day 1</h2><h3>Breakfast (382 calories)</h3><ul><li>1 serving Chickpea & Potato Hash</li></ul><h3>A.M.
