Something that could reduce the risk of developing and worsening almost all diseases?</p><p>Recently, the Surgeon General – formally the "highest" doctor in the US – initiated a public campaign with the corresponding official publication of the US health authorities, dramatically emphasizing the importance of connectedness for health. Because this "something" exists!</p><p>A study from our own institute, in cooperation with the Charles University of Prague, which has just been published in the renowned international scientific journal Stress and Health, emphatically underlines this finding:</p><p>It's the connectedness – being socially embedded, the experienced belonging, feeling of "being at home" – that comes along like a kind of miracle cure and, as it turns out, is particularly effective against the major diseases of our time.</p><h2>Can strong social ties actually help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and strokes?</h2><p>It may sound incredible or even paradoxical, but a good social network and good connections can help almost like a medicine, for example, in cases of:</p><p>•             Heart disease,</p><p>•             High blood pressure,</p><p>•             Diabetes,</p><p>•             Depression,</p><p>•             Dementia or</p><p>•             Anxiety.</p><p>And how effective connectedness is – or harmful, when it's missing:</p><p>•             Social isolation increases the risk of premature mortality by 29%.</p><p>•             Loneliness increases the risk of heart disease and stroke by a third each.</p><p>•             Reduced social networks increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and kidney diseases.</p><p>And these are just a few examples.</p><h2>How does social isolation affect the risk of depression and dementia?</h2><p>•             Chronic social isolation increases the risk of dementia by 50%.</p><p>•             Adults who often feel lonely develop depression more than twice as often.</p><p>•             In fact, social isolation (even the feeling of it) is at least as harmful to health as physical inactivity or smoking!</p><h2>What role does listening play in medicine, particularly in relation to mental health?</h2><p>Listening is a supposedly simple means that demonstrably strengthens connectedness. And overall health too, especially mental:</p><p>•             Strengthened social ties can improve the response to stress, minimize the negative effects of stress on health – stress gets "buffered away."</p><p>•             People with a strong sense of belonging feel significantly healthier – and they are! They are also happier and suffer less from burnout.</p><p>•             Children and adolescents who maintain positive relationships with peers, parents, and teachers even achieve better academic results.</p><p><strong>About the expert Tobias Esch</strong></p><p>Since 2016, Tobias Esch has been working as a university professor and institute director for integrative health care at the University of Witten/Herdecke, including managing the university clinic he founded.
