Provided by MUO</em></figcaption></figure><p>Exercise is great for our health, and contrary to popular misunderstanding, its benefits aren’t limited to a weight-loss focus. The best kinds of physical activity are not about “burning calories” or “shedding fat”, but supporting our overall health and well-being.</p><p>Regular exercise can contribute to improved mood, better sleep, stronger bones and muscles, and reduced risk of injury and disease—just to name a few health benefits.</p><p>Whether you want to improve one area of your health or to support your overall well-being, here are the best non-weight-loss-focused exercises—complete with explanations of why and how they can support your long-term health.</p><h2>       1. Pelvic Floor Exercises for Your Pelvic Floor Health     </h2><p>Looking after your pelvic floor health is vital for preventing various health issues. Your pelvic floor muscles support organs including your bladder and bowel (and uterus in women), aid bladder control, and help keep the spine and pelvis stable. Strong pelvic floor muscles are crucial for preventing incontinence, organ prolapse, UTIs (urinary tract infections), and other health conditions. For men, the pelvic floor can become weakened from chronic constipation or prostate cancer treatment. For women, heavy periods, endometriosis, pregnancy, childbirth, and chronic constipation are risk factors.</p><p>To help prevent pelvic floor health complications, you can practice pelvic floor exercises—also known as Kegels. There are plenty of online resources that share pelvic floor exercises where you can also learn about how to look after your pelvic floor health.</p><p>If you want to jump straight in and incorporate Kegels into your everyday routine, try the Squeeze Time - Kegel Exercises app. It’s free to download and offers timed Kegels with instructions on how to perform each exercise. You can also set reminders to do your daily pelvic floor exercises and review your activity in the <strong>History</strong> tab.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Squeeze Time for Android | iOS (Free, offers in-app purchases)</p><h2>       2. Mobility Movements for Injury Prevention and Quality of Life     </h2><p>Mobility is the ability to move purposefully throughout your day—incorporating balance, coordination, physical stamina, strength, and a range of motion. According to Harvard Health, good mobility is crucial for not only carrying out everyday tasks, but also for preventing injuries, avoiding falls, and decreasing physical decline as you age.</p><p>Practicing regular mobility exercises is the best way to improve your balance, flexibility, and strength, among all other factors required to keep you moving at any age. This can be achieved through yoga, Pilates, and physiotherapy.</p><h3>Yoga for Mobility</h3><p>Yoga is renowned for its health-promoting benefits. While its traditional practice is rooted in the spiritual discipline (as developed in its homeland, India), you can find modern practices that focus on the mobilizing benefits of original asanas (poses) and vinyasas (flow of poses).</p><p>The Yoga Institute YouTube Channel can help you improve your mobility through traditional practices. The Yoga Institute was founded in 1918 by Shri Yogendraji, making it the oldest organized yoga center in the world. Alternatively, learn how to choose the right yoga style for your goals in our guide.</p><h3>Pilates for Mobility</h3><p>Pilates is a mind-body exercise that focuses on precise movements and breathing techniques. Established Pilates teacher, Lottie Murphy, shares plenty of free flexibility and mobility Pilates classes on her YouTube Channel. Alternatively, you can download her Pilates app for Android or iOS to access Pilates content on your favorite device.</p><p>Practicing physiotherapy exercises can help prevent injury and keep your body in optimum health. It keeps your muscles flexible and strong while enabling a range of motion in your joints. The pliability: mobility+recovery app is a great tool to learn physiotherapy exercises to improve your mobility. Start with the mobility test before proceeding with exercises to improve your mobility, strength, and endurance based on your personal needs.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> pliability: mobility+recovery for Android | iOS (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2>       3. Aerobic Exercises for Your Cardiovascular Health     </h2><p>Looking after your cardiovascular health is important for your long-term health. Aerobic exercise can help support your heart and circulatory system, enabling you to complete your daily tasks without getting tired or breathless. It can help prevent cardiovascular disease (or stop it from worsening) by lowering your blood pressure and heart rate, plus improving your cholesterol levels. Other benefits include improved sleep and better emotional well-being.</p><p>Whatever your heart or circulatory condition, exercise can benefit your health, so says the British Heart Foundation. Physical activity can help ease symptoms, slow down heart disease, and support your overall well-being.</p><p>If you do have a heart condition, please make sure you consult your doctor before you start any new activity. For most, the We Are Undefeatable YouTube Channel offers accessible exercise videos that are suitable for people with health conditions. You’ll find a range of aerobic classes, including dance, energy-boosting exercises, and moderate aerobics.</p><p>You can also support your cardiovascular health through other aerobic activities, such as dance, walking, running, cycling, swimming, and more. Check out these aerobics workout apps to get your heart pumping, or you can try these low-impact cardio workouts to help prevent injury.</p><h2>       4.

The National Institute on Aging suggests choosing weight-bearing exercises, such as strength training, hiking, climbing stairs, or tennis, to help keep your bones strong as you age.</p>                                                                                                                  <p>If you want to try strength training, you can find over 1,000 workout plans on the reputable fitness platform, Muscle & Strength.
