For the insured, that means more copays for blood tests, drugs and doctor visits as well as higher copays to see specialists and to receive blood infusions (for anemics). Health insurance rates will increase too. For the uninsured, the bills can become unsurmountable. </p><p>Here’s more on poor nutrition and the costs associated with it.</p><table class="public-table table-wrap-normal">  <tr> <td> <p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p> <ul> <li>In the long-run, eating poorly is expensive for an individual as well as the community and the country.</li> <li>Diseases caused by poor nutrition come with heavy costs, whether the patient is insured or uninsured.</li> <li>Nutrition is so important to health that there are so-called Food is Medicine initiatives, with doctors prescribing fresh produce and healthcare providers distributing grocery vouchers.</li> </ul> </td> </tr>  </table><h4>On This Page</h4><ul class="toc-wrapper collapsed"><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">Diseases and Conditions Caused By Poor Nutrition</p></li><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">What Is a Good Diet and How Much Does It Cost?</p></li><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">Diabetes, Heart Disease and Anemia: Most Common Diseases Caused By Poor Diet</p></li><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">Is Food Medicine?</p></li><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">What Foods Should I Avoid?</p></li><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">What Foods Should I Eat?</p></li><li class="toc-item"><p class="toc-item-text">Cost of Poor Nutrition FAQs</p></li></ul><h2>Diseases and Conditions Caused By Poor Nutrition</h2><p>Proper nutrition is vital for good health.

The focus of this program is to substitute doctor visits and medication with food that will heal the body. </p><h2>What Foods Should I Avoid?</h2><p>Each person’s diet should be designed by a physician, especially if there is an existing condition.
