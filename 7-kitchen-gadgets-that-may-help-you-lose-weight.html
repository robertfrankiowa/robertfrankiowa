    <main><h1>7 Kitchen Gadgets That May Help You Lose Weight</h1><p>When you need an assist in the kitchen to crank out healthy meals, several gadgets work well. “One reason kitchen gadgets are so valuable is that they’re time-saving,” says Abbie Gellman, a registered dietitian and chef based in New York City. “A lot of kitchen gadgets allow us to cook more efficiently, making healthy meals more accessible.” </p><h2>1. Food Scale</h2><p>Measuring ingredients or foods on a scale can help anyone monitor their diet. “A food scale is a good way to make sure portions are accurate,” says Gellman. For example, a 3-ounce serving of cooked protein (chicken, steak) is roughly the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). But when you want to be more accurate with serving sizes — such as when you log your food in an app such as Lose It! — you can use a food scale to check your portion. </p><p>And using a food scale doesn’t have to be forever, adds Lindsay Allen, RD, who specializes in weight loss and metabolic health in Largo, Florida. As you learn more about what a portion size looks like, you can get to a place where you can better eyeball what you need. “A food scale is awesome for education,” she says.</p><h2>2. Air Fryer</h2><p>You may have heard raves about the air fryer — and for good reason. “The air fryer is a game-changer if you enjoy a crispy texture without the added calories,” says Melanie Marcus, RD, founder of Miss Nutritious Eats in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It uses hot air to make foods crispy without the need for excessive oil, reducing calories and fat content without compromising on flavor.” For example, canola oil contains about 124 calories per tablespoon, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and it’s easy to use a heavy hand when cooking in a pan or roasting in the oven. </p><p>An air fryer can also help satisfy cravings for crispy foods like chicken wings and french fries, adds Allen.</p><h2>3. Instant Pot</h2><p>The name doesn’t lie: “One of the things I like about the Instant Pot is if you forget to plan dinner, you can cook something really fast,” says Gellman, who is the author of the <em>Instant Pot Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</em>. One example? Beans — it’s one food that research links to maintaining a healthy weight and decreasing the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Typically, you’d have to soak dried beans overnight and then cook them on the stove. But with an Instant Pot, you can get them done in less than an hour with little effort, she says. “It’s like a slow cooker on steroids,” she says.</p><p>Of course, beans are just one example. You can cook various foods in the Instant Pot, from main dishes to desserts.</p><h2>4. Juicer or Blender</h2><p>Allen says if she had to pick between getting a juicer and a blender, she’d choose the blender for its versatility and ability to preserve a certain important weight-supportive nutrient: fiber. “You keep all the fiber in the fruits and vegetables with a blender, and you can create sauces, soups, and juice,” says Allen.</p><p>The food keeps its fiber when you blend it because you don’t discard any of it, as you would with a juicer — but one study shows that blending does disrupt the fiber. Still, that can be a good thing: In some instances, the study found that blending blackberries and raspberries helped release some fiber from their seeds. Blending can also increase soluble fiber; in fact, blended fruit results in lower blood sugar responses.</p><p>That said, a juicer can also be useful from a health standpoint, especially if it’s the only way you like or can stomach your greens. (The exception may be spinach, which you may find palatable even when blended into a smoothie.) Juicing removes the fiber but also is a more concentrated source of vitamins and minerals. “This will typically come with higher sugar content, so it’s not for everyone, but it can be very useful depending on the situation,” Allen says. </p><p>Gellman offers another tip: Blend extra protein into a hot or cold soup. She recommends adding a high-quality, unflavored protein powder — she uses a whey protein powder — or pureed white beans or silken tofu, which also provide creaminess. Increasing the protein in your meal can help you stay more satisfied until the next one, she says. This, in turn, can support your weight goals.</p><h2>5. Microwave</h2><p>A microwave comes in handy whenever you need to reheat leftovers. It also makes cooking at home more doable by allowing you to cook larger batches of food (hello, meal prep!). Cooking at home promotes better diet quality, especially for those with a higher income, according to research. Additionally, a study concluded that people who eat home-cooked meals more than five times per week (compared to less than three) achieve several benefits: They eat more fruit and vegetables, are 28 percent less likely to have overweight body mass index (BMI), and are 24 percent less likely to have an excess percentage of body fat.</p><p>If eating at home this often seems difficult, a couple of microwave tricks may help you. For instance, frozen berries make a lovely berry sauce for whole-grain pancakes and waffles when you heat them up. Gellman also likes to steam broccoli and cauliflower lightly in the microwave before sauteing them with garlic and ginger in a pan; she says this makes their flavors pop.</p><h2>6. Slow Cooker</h2><p>You know the saying “Set it and forget it”? That’s what Allen says she loves most about slow cookers like the Crock-Pot. “It’s super easy,” says Allen. “You don’t actually have to know how to cook, you can make a lot of food, and leftovers taste even better the next day.”</p><p>Not only that, but a slow cooker helps you save extra calories because you use less fat to cook the meal, adds Gellman. She says she likes to use a slow cooker for meal prep — such as making a veggie and bean soup for that week’s lunches or a big batch of steel-cut oats for breakfasts.</p><h2>7. Measuring Cups and Spoons </h2><p>When cooking on a weight loss journey, it helps to measure your ingredients because serving sizes can be deceiving, says Marcus. For example, do you know exactly what a tablespoon of nut butter (approximately 100 calories, per the USDA) looks like? It may be smaller (or larger) than you think. Similarly, ½ cup of cooked rice, quinoa, and oatmeal are all considered one serving of whole grain, according to the AHA, but may look slightly different.</p><p>Measuring cups and spoons help you determine portion sizes and track what you’re eating. “Portions are a big part of weight loss, and if we’re not paying attention, they can get out of hand,” says Gellman. Use these tools not just to learn how to make your favorite recipes, but to help keep your nutrition on track.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>The right kitchen gadgets can simplify the process of preparing healthy meals, making it easier to stick to weight loss goals. But with so many gadgets out there, it’s tough to tell what you really need. Certain tools, like the air fryer, help you make healthy meals with less time and effort — making them the perfect sous chef in the kitchen! — while things like measuring cups and a food scale keep portions accurate when you log foods in your LoseIt! app.</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking:</p></main>
