    <main><h1>18 Unhealthy Habits Women Over 60 Should Abandon Today</h1><p><p>As time passes, we have to adjust our lives to best suit our age. This is particularly important after we reach the age of 60, as we need to look after our bodies to maximize our happiness in our golden years. For guidance, here are 18 unhealthy habits that women over 60 should stop doing now.</p><h2>Skipping Meals</h2><p>Sadly, the Royal Voluntary Service shares that every day, older women choose to skip meals, which is a very unhealthy habit. You need to stop doing this, as it could lead to unhealthy weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and energy slumps. Try to stick to a balanced and healthy diet, helping to keep your blood sugar levels stable and energetic.</p><figure><img title="Skipping Meals" src="IMG/BB1pyoi7_skipping_meals.jpg" alt="Skipping Meals"><figcaption><em>Skipping Meals.

It’s never healthy to be hydrated at any age, but after 60, it can seriously affect our energy levels, skin, and overall health. There’s no denying that it’s difficult to know how much to drink, but aim to drink eight glasses of water daily, and you’ll be okay.</p><h2>Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle</h2><p>It becomes increasingly important to get out and about as you get older, as leading a sedentary lifestyle can cause your body to degrade. You won’t want to participate in extreme sports, either, but taking it slow and going for a brisk walk will do you a world of good, both for your physical and mental well-being.</p><h2>Overlooking Sleep</h2><p>As women grow older, they generally find it becomes harder to get adequate sleep, so it’s all the more important to try your best. Without enough sleep, your memory, mood, and immune function can all be negatively impacted. Maintain a regular sleep schedule, cut out caffeine, and keep up your sleep hygiene to maximize your chances of getting a good night’s rest.</p><h2>Smoking</h2><p>It should come as no surprise to you that if you haven’t already, it’s very important to quit smoking after you turn 60. Smoking poses serious health risks, including lung disease and cardiovascular issues, and even if you’ve smoked for your whole life, quitting now could still help. You’ll notice improved breathing, circulation, and overall health, all of which can improve your happiness during your golden years.</p><h2>Excessive Alcohol Consumption</h2><p>There’s nothing wrong with having the occasional drink but consuming alcohol in excess can be very dangerous, particularly for older women. Not only could it lead to various health problems, such as liver disease, but it could cause you to have a nasty fall, which will come with all sorts of nasty consequences.</p><h2>Neglecting Dental Health</h2><p>Some older women take the perspective that if they didn’t look after their teeth when they were younger, the damage is done. This is a bad attitude to have; continuing to ignore your oral hygiene will only make matters worse, potentially landing you with gum disease or pain when you eat. So, keep brushing those teeth and remember to get regular dental check-ups–you’ll thank yourself later.</p><h2>Skipping Regular Check-Ups</h2><p>Speaking of checkups, women over 60 should be prioritizing checkups of any kind, not avoiding them. They can help you learn of health problems before they become serious, allowing you to get them treated. Getting a checkup might cause you anxiety, but once you get into the habit, your mind will be more at ease.</p><h2>Eating Processed Foods</h2><p>There’s no denying that some of the tastiest foods are the unhealthiest, but relying on processed foods as an older lady is a recipe for disaster. You could develop nutritional deficiencies, diabetes, or other health issues. So, opt for fresh, whole foods whenever possible, which will provide you with the nutrients your body needs to thrive.</p><h2>Neglecting Mental Health</h2><p>Alongside your physical health, you also need to stop ignoring your mental health as you continue to age. Continuing to do so could lead to anxiety and depression, which are the last things you want during your retirement. So, engage in activities that promote mental well-being and seek help when needed, ensuring you stay happy throughout the next few decades.</p><figure><img title="Neglecting Mental Health" src="IMG/BB1pywSi_neglecting_mental_health.jpg" alt="Neglecting Mental Health"><figcaption><em>Neglecting Mental Health.

No one expects you to start deadlifting, but it’s a great idea to practice weight-bearing exercises, helping your body develop lean muscle and prevent your bone density from decreasing.</p><h2>Poor Posture</h2><p>If you have fallen into the bad habit of having poor posture, it’s time to change that now before it’s too late. Maintaining poor posture can cause back pain and other musculoskeletal issues in older women, so do your best to keep your back straight and do exercises that strengthen your core, helping to avoid any complications in the years to come.</p><h2>Overuse of Painkillers</h2><p>Women over 60 are often prescribed painkillers to help with a variety of conditions and injuries, but it’s important not to become reliant on them. Frequent use can lead to addiction and other health issues, so speak to your doctor about exploring alternative pain management methods, such as physical therapy, yoga, or mindfulness.</p><figure><img title="Overuse of Painkillers" src="IMG/BB1owFYs_overuse_of_painkillers.jpg" alt="Overuse of Painkillers"><figcaption><em>Overuse of Painkillers.

Meanwhile, if you continue to ignore your skin’s health, it can get dry, tough, or even develop cancer. So, keep moisturizing and wear sunscreen, and your skin will look just fine.</p><h2>Ignoring Financial Health</h2><p>While your physical and mental health should always take priority, this doesn’t mean you should overlook your financial health. If you don’t manage your finances and plan your estate, you’ll add a lot of stress and insecurity to your life, which no senior lady wants to deal with. So, regularly review your finances, and if you’re struggling, seek financial advice.</p><h2>Avoiding Social Interaction</h2><p>It’s a terrible idea to keep isolating yourself as you grow past 60 years of age. This could lead to loneliness and negatively affect your mental health, so do your best to maintain social connections through family, friends, and community activities. Just because you’re getting older doesn’t mean you can’t still have a vibrant social life.</p><h2>Not Practicing Mindfulness</h2><p>If you’re turning 60, it’s very possible that you were never encouraged to explore mindfulness when you were younger, but it’s never too late to start. Mindfulness activities, such as meditation, yoga, or simply walking mindfully, can greatly reduce the stress and anxiety of aging. Give it a go–we’re sure you’ll find benefits in it.</p><h2>Overlooking Vision and Hearing Health</h2><p>It’s an unavoidable reality that, as older women, our vision and hearing start to decline. However, this doesn’t mean you should just accept your fate. Get regular checkups, ask your doctor for glasses and hearing aids if you think you need them, and don’t forget to use them. Being able to hear and see properly will greatly enhance the quality of your life in your golden years.</p><figure><img title="Overlooking Vision and Hearing Health" src="IMG/BB1pyul7_overlooking_vision_and_hearing_health.jpg" alt="Overlooking Vision and Hearing Health"><figcaption><em>Overlooking Vision and Hearing Health.
