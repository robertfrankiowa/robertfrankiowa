    <main><h1>What To Look For In A Personal Trainer</h1><p>If you’re looking to hire a personal trainer, you want to make sure they’re good at what they do so they can help you get the results you deserve. Here’s what you should look for in a personal trainer to ensure you’re making the right choice.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Sharon Gam, Ph.D." src="IMG/AA1lN0Te_what_to_look_for_in_a_personal_trainer.jpg" alt="What to look for in a personal trainer"><figcaption><em>What to look for in a personal trainer. Provided by Sharon Gam, Ph.D.</em></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>What kind of personal trainer certification(s) do they have?</strong></h2><p>Look for a trainer who has at least one nationally recognized and independently accredited fitness certification, such as from ACSM, ACE, NASM, NSCA, or ISSA. All of these certifying bodies require continuing education in order to maintain their certifications.</p><p>That’s important, because the science of fitness evolves and personal trainers need to keep up with it.</p><p>If someone got certified in the 1980s and never did any more education, they might still think static stretching is a good way to warm up before exercise. We now know that it’s not.</p><p>Certain certifications are better than others. Some, like the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) certification from the NSCA, have prerequisites for even applying to the program, including a college degree in an exercise science or related field.</p><p>That prerequisite means that your trainer has done several years of education in the field and has a good understanding of how exercise affects the body and how to design a proper exercise program.</p><p>There are many other certifications that don’t require any background knowledge and can be done over a weekend. A trainer with those kinds of certifications might not have the in-depth understanding that’s needed to take general workouts and personalize them to your specific needs and goals.</p><h2><strong>What kind of experience do they have?</strong></h2><p>Education is important, but you also need to be able to put that knowledge to work and provide effective instruction. A good personal trainer should be able to clearly explain how to do each exercise, why they recommend that exercise or activity, and how it applies to what you want to achieve.</p><p>I’ll admit that when I started in the industry more than 15 years ago, I still had a lot to learn about how to relate to my clients, how to understand their unique challenges and perspectives, and how to cue them to do their exercises properly. I got those lessons by working with real people.</p><p>Ideally, you should look for a personal trainer who has experience working with people like you; people with similar goals, lifestyles, injuries, and other traits.</p><h2><strong>What is their fitness philosophy?</strong></h2><p>There is no “right” way to exercise. There are a lot of different ways to get fit and healthy. As long as you’re moving consistently, you’ll get the benefits.</p><p>That being said, there are certainly some approaches that work better than others and that are based in science, while others are based on fads or what looks good in an Instagram video.</p><p>A good personal trainer should be able to design a systematic program that works all of your major muscle groups, targets your personal goals, is safe, and progresses as you get fitter and stronger. They should also know how to utilize several different training styles.</p><p>Preferences definitely come into play, and many people are drawn to different approaches to fitness.</p><p>Some trainers prefer heavy strength training, others like higher intensity exercise, some put more emphasis on warm up and recovery. Some trainers like bodybuilder style training, others believe in functional movements.</p><p>That’s ok, as long as they also know how to adapt their style or use a different style if it’s more appropriate for your specific goals or situation.</p><p>Any trainer who thinks their way is the only way is not a good trainer.</p><p>There’s also how they execute their programs. This really comes down to your preferences and your trainer’s personality. Some people like the “drill sergeant” style instructor that yells at you to “drop and give me 20 push ups!!!” I personally take a gentler and more patient approach.</p><h2><strong>Do they personalize your program?</strong></h2><p>Some personal trainers will use the same program for every client. That’s a problem.</p><p>Each client is different. You have unique goals, experiences, physiology, biomechanics, movement patterns, and preferences. You may also have a unique history of injuries or pain.</p><p>It’s very important that your trainer takes the general best practices and personalizes them to your individual situation. If they can’t do that, keep looking.</p><h2><strong>Do they do assessments and track your progress?</strong></h2><p><strong><em>“You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”</em></strong></p><p>A good personal trainer should start your program with a comprehensive assessment. They should look at your posture, the way you move, your mobility, your strength, and your fitness.</p><p>Your personal trainer should also be keeping track of your progress.</p><p>In my sessions, I track every exercise my client does. I also write down the number of reps they do in each set and how much weight they use. I take notes on any movement cues that work well or any issues that the client reports.</p><p>That information is essential for progressing the program over time. If your trainer isn’t keeping these kinds of records, they’re not doing their job properly.</p><p>No matter your goals, I can design a safe, smart, and progressive exercise program that works for you. Contact me to schedule a free consultation!</p></main>
