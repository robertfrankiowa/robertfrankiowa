It's a sad reality that health tends to decline with age, and unfortunately Medicare doesn't fully cover all care costs.</p><p>For those hoping this government-run program would foot the bill, it may come as a surprise just how far short it falls. With prescription drug limitations, co-insurance costs, coverage gaps and high premiums for supplemental policies, the amount of money you end up having to spend can be eye-popping.</p><h2>Don't miss</h2><ul> <li>Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in.

But traditional Medicare consists of different parts, including:</p><p><strong>Part D</strong>: Covers prescription drugs. You have a choice of Part D plans, and premiums and co-insurance costs can vary.</p><p>You also have the option to sign up for Medicare Part C, or a Medicare Advantage Plan, which is a private health insurance plan that replaces Medicare (Parts A and B, sometimes D) and can include additional benefits, such as vision and dental care. There are different Medicare Advantage Plans available, and costs vary widely.</p><p>Alternatively, you can choose a Medigap plan, which is a supplement to traditional Medicare that is sold by private insurers only to those with Medicare Parts A and B. Medigap plans typically help pay for co-insurance costs and some things Parts A and B normally don't cover.</p><p>No matter which of these options you choose, though, there are costs involved .</p><h2>Making a plan to afford health care</h2><p>There's no cheap or easy way to get health care as a retiree, so your best option is to prepare for it.</p><p>If you're eligible for a health savings account (HSA), contribute as much as you can. You get tax breaks for money you earmark for out-of-pocket care costs in this account. You can contribute with pre-tax funds, invest without paying taxes on gains and make tax-free withdrawals when you use the money to pay for health-related expenses.</p><p>It's also important to remember there's a dedicated enrollment period for Medicare, starting three months before you turn 65 and ending three months afterward. If you delay signing up for Medicare coverage, you may be subject to a lifetime penalty on your monthly payments.</p><p>You'll want to make sure you save diligently for health care — and all your other retirement costs — during your working life so you have the money you need for your golden years by the time your career is over.</p><h2>What to read next</h2><p><em>This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
