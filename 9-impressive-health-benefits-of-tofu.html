However, these assertions have not only been disproved by research, but tofu actually boasts an impressive amount of health benefits, thanks to its robust nutrition profile. </p><p>Read on to learn what tofu is, how it benefits overall health, and some nutrition facts in this tofu health benefits guide.</p><h2>What Is Tofu?</h2><p>Tofu is simply soybean curd. It’s made through heating, separating, and pressing condensed soy milk into the recognizable white blocks that many of us know as tofu. The process is very similar to cheesemaking. </p><p>“This popular soy-based food originated in China over 2,000 years ago,” says Kristen Carli, MS, RD, registered dietitian, owner of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness, and co-founder of Expert with Influence. And with this heritage, tofu is often found in many Asian cuisines, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai. </p><p>Fast forward to today and tofu can be found in pretty much every style of food as a super popular plant-based option. “Plus, tofu has a mild flavor that easily absorbs the flavors of other ingredients, making it a versatile and increasingly prevalent ingredient in cooking,” adds Carli.</p><h2>Nutrition Profile of Tofu</h2><p>But beyond its yummy, mild flavor that lends itself to many styles of cuisine, tofu is nothing short of a nutritional powerhouse. Here’s a peek into its nutritional breakdown, per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Database:</p><p><strong>Raw Firm Tofu (3.5 ounces)</strong></p><p><strong>Macronutrients</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Calories: </strong>144 calories</li><li><strong>Protein: </strong>17 grams (g)</li><li><strong>Total Carbohydrates: </strong>3 g</li><li><strong>Fiber: </strong>2 g</li><li><strong>Fat: </strong>9 g</li><li><strong>Saturated Fat: </strong>1 g</li><li><strong>Unsaturated Fat: </strong>8 g</li><li><strong>Cholesterol: </strong>0 milligrams (mg), 0 percent of Daily Value (DV)*</li></ul><p><strong>Micronutrients</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Vitamin A: </strong>166 International Units (IU), 18% DV</li><li><strong>Calcium: </strong>683 mg, 53% DV</li><li><strong>Manganese: </strong>1.2 mg, 51% DV</li><li><strong>Copper: </strong>0.4 mg, 42% DV</li><li><strong>Selenium: </strong>17 micrograms (mcg), 32% DV</li><li><strong>Phosphorus: </strong>190 mg, 15% DV</li><li><strong>Iron: </strong>2.7 mg, 15% DV</li><li><strong>Magnesium: </strong>58 mg, 14% DV</li><li><strong>Zinc: </strong>1.6 mg, 14% DV</li></ul><p>*Daily Value is based on the average adult needs for males and females without pre-existing conditions per the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>In addition to these nutrients, tofu also contains a variety of plant compounds or phytonutrients, most notably soy isoflavones.</p><h2>9 Health Benefits of Tofu</h2><p>Given tofu’s remarkable nutrient density, it only makes sense that this plant-based protein would have much to offer in the way of health benefits. Here are the some of the most noteworthy:</p><h3>Tofu Boosts Gut Health</h3><p>As a fiber-rich food, tofu can support digestion and overall gut health. Fiber aids in the digestive process through encouraging general regularity while also acting as a prebiotic to feed the healthy bacteria living in the gut microbiome. In fact, a 2016 study found soy to boost bifidobacteria and lactobacilli bacteria populations (two healthy strains) in the biome. A thriving microbiome is linked to better digestion and overall gut health (among many other impressive benefits). Additionally, a 2020 review noted soy isoflavones to support the gut lining, helping to reduce inflammation and amplify these gut benefits.</p><h3>Tofu Supports Heart Health</h3><p>“Tofu is also low in saturated fat and cholesterol, making it a heart-healthy option,” explains Carli. While there has been conflicting evidence on whether these two types of fat contribute to heart disease or not, plenty of opposing studies have found that they do, warranting caution around the nutrients. But more importantly, tofu is rich in heart-healthy unsaturated fats, which help to lower blood cholesterol levels, further supporting heart health and decreasing heart disease risk.</p><h3>Tofu Aids in Metabolic Health</h3><p>The protein, fiber, and healthy fats found in tofu all work to slow digestion, yielding a more gradual rise and fall in blood sugars. This aids in overall blood sugar management—a meaningful impact for those with metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. In fact, a 2020 study found soy intake to lower the risk for developing type 2 diabetes.</p><h3>Tofu May Improve Immune Health</h3><p>Tofu is rich in vitamin A, copper, zinc, selenium, and plant compounds. All of these micronutrients are antioxidants that work to fight inflammation in the body and support overall immune function. “Additionally, the isoflavones in tofu have been linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers, such as breast, prostate, and colorectal,” says Carli.</p><h3>Tofu Builds and Repairs Healthy Tissue</h3><p>When it comes to plant-powered protein, it’s tough to beat what tofu has to offer. “Tofu is unique in that it is a plant-based protein that is complete, meaning it contains all of the essential amino acids,” explains Carli. This protein content helps to build and repair most tissues you can think of throughout the body, including muscles, hair, nails, vital organs, and more. Plus, the iron in tofu furthers this reparative benefit by producing hemoglobin in red blood cells to deliver oxygen to our cells.</p><h3>Tofu Strengthens Bone</h3><p>While calcium often receives all the credit for building healthy bones, there are other nutrients that are just as important in the process. Magnesium and phosphorus are two of these nutrients that tofu just happens to be rich in—in addition to calcium. These three minerals in tofu combine to support healthy bone growth and bone mineral density.</p><h3>Tofu Champions Brain Health</h3><p>Some interesting research has even linked soy isoflavone intake to better brain health. One 2020 meta-analysis linked this plant compound found in soy to improved cognitive function in adults, while this 2018 study found tofu and soy isoflavone intake to be inversely related with depression symptoms in pregnant women.</p><p>“Soy isoflavones in tofu have been linked to improved menopausal symptoms in women as well,” says Carli. Research backs this up, with soy intake being associated with better bone density and weight management as well as reduced hot flash intensity.</p><p>And finally, tofu may also help keep our eye health in tip-top shape, thanks to the vitamin A it contains. This fat-soluble vitamin plays a key role in several elements of overall eye health.</p><h2>Should Anyone Avoid Tofu?</h2><p>While these health benefits are well-supported by evidence, there are still plenty of concerning rumors swirling about tofu, so should anyone avoid it?</p><p>Research has largely disproved claims that soy is linked to increased risk for cancer, thyroid issues, fertility concerns, hormonal imbalance, and more. Though, it’s still always best to check with your doctor if you have concerns regarding tofu and any pre-existing conditions.</p><p>That said, soy is one of the seven major allergens and those who are allergic to this legume should avoid tofu.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>While soy products like tofu have been at the center of several health disputes, the latest research illustrates that tofu is not only a safe food, but a super healthy one at that. Tofu can positively benefit our health in a multitude of ways, from better heart and metabolic health to improved immunity and muscle function. This bodes well for the health conscious and foodies alike, as tofu is a scrumptious addition to a plethora of healthy and delicious dishes.</p></main>
