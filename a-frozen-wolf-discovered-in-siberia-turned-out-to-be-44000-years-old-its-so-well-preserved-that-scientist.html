Its teeth and much of its fur are still intact, as are some of its organs.</p><figure><img title="North-Eastern Federal University" src="IMG/BB1p5rUe_mummified_wolf_on_a_table_close_up_of_its_head_with_matted_fur_and_complete_teeth_bared_with_someone_wear.jpg" alt="mummified wolf on a table close up of its head with matted fur and complete teeth bared with someone wearing protective gear and gloves writing a note beside it"><figcaption><em>The wolf is impeccably intact, with teeth and fur.

Studying the animal's genome will help reveal where it fits into the canine family tree.</p><p>After examining one of its teeth, the scientists believe the wolf was an adult male. It probably hunted in a flat, cold environment full of mammoths, wooly rhinoceroses, extinct horses, bison, and reindeer.</p><p>Remains of some of those animals might even be left in the wolf's gut. Researchers took samples of its stomach and digestive tract to learn more and are awaiting results.</p><p>The researchers may also be able to tease out what functions ancient microbes performed in the wolf's gut, and whether it had parasites, Losey said. If any of the microorganisms are unknown to science, they could play a role in the development of future medicines, the researchers said in the statement.</p><p>This discovery is just part of a larger collaboration to study other ancient animals, including fossil hares, a horse, and a bear. The researchers previously studied a wolf head from the Pleistocene era and have another wolf fossil awaiting dissection.</p><h2>Ancient animals and infectious agents are thawing</h2><figure><img title="jitendrajadhav/Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1p5mfR_illustration_of_an_anthrax_virus.jpg" alt="illustration of an anthrax virus"><figcaption><em>Scientists have seen traces of other viruses in permafrost. jitendrajadhav/Getty Images. jitendrajadhav/Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the world's permafrost thaws due to rising global temperatures, more ancient creatures like this are re-emerging. In the Yukon, for example, paleontologists are still fawning over an impeccably preserved baby mammoth discovered in 2022.</p><p>Not everything in the permafrost is so harmless, though.</p><p>In 2016, thawing in Siberia's Yamal Peninsula released anthrax from a once-frozen reindeer carcass, causing an outbreak that infected 36 people and killed one child.</p><p>Researchers fear that other pathogens may slumber in the tundra, with the thaw of a warming world slowly creeping toward them.</p><p>Last year, researcher Jean-Michel Claverie announced that he had revived a 48,000-year-old virus they found in the Siberian permafrost. It could still infect single-celled amoebas.</p><p>"We view these amoeba-infecting viruses as surrogates for all other possible viruses that might be in permafrost," Claverie told CNN at the time. "We see the traces of many, many, many other viruses. So we know they are there. We don't know for sure that they are still alive."</p><p>Any ancient viruses or bacteria in the guts of the Yakutia wolf could help researchers better understand the microbes hiding inside permafrost creatures.</p><p>If you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.</p></main>
