This can mean easing stress, boosting immunity or getting you energized or super hydrated. </p><p>  Functional beverages — as the drink industry refers to them — often contain ingredients that were once found only in supplements or herbal teas: probiotics, prebiotics, hibiscus, ashwagandha, “medicinal” mushrooms and more. </p><p>  And they’re popular. These days, nearly 40 percent of adults seek out drinks with ingredients said to confer wellness, according to the market research firm Packaged Facts. One possible reason: Consumers have “pill fatigue,” according to Howard Telford, senior industry manager for soft drinks research at Euromonitor International, a strategic market research firm in Chicago. And beverages are seen as an easier, more enjoyable way to get herbs and other supplements into diets, he said. </p><p>  While some of these drinks may be better for you (though pricier) than sugary sodas or alcohol, do they do all that’s claimed? Here’s what’s actually good for you. </p><h2>  <b>The promise: A healthier gut</b> </h2><p>  You have probably heard of probiotics and prebiotics, and that they can help keep your digestive system in good working order. (The former are beneficial bacteria that live in your gut, and the latter “feed” them.) You may also be familiar with the fermented tea kombucha, a probiotic drink. </p><p>  These days, though, probiotics and prebiotics are being added to a slew of cold drinks. Some are marketed as healthier versions of soda. </p><p>  “Probiotics can help populate the gut with the healthy bacteria that aid proper digestion and help reduce inflammation, which is at the root of heart disease and many other chronic conditions,” said Dalia Perelman, a research dietitian at Stanford University. </p><p>  But drinks with probiotics might not have the same benefits as foods with probiotics (such as yogurt and kimchi). They are more akin to a supplement in drink form, Perelman said. </p><p>  That is because the drinks don’t have the variety of bacteria that those foods do. Plus, the foods are fermented, a process that creates other compounds that are good for us, according to Perelman. Raw (unpasteurized) kombucha and Spare Food tonic, a drink that contains leftover whey from yogurt-making, are fermented. But probiotic sodas are not. </p><p>  As for prebiotic sodas, some contain added fiber, usually inulin or chicory root extracted from plants. “Here, you’re only getting the type of prebiotic that’s added in, while you’d likely benefit more from the variety of prebiotics in fiber-rich foods,” says Amy Keating, a Consumer Reports nutritionist. </p><p>  That said, these drinks are lower in calories and added sugars than traditional sodas, so they’re a healthier choice if you are watching your intake of sweets. Note, however, that some contain stevia — and recent research has raised concerns about the health effects of sugar alternatives, so consider limiting your consumption. </p><h2>  <b>The promise: Wellness and stronger immunity</b> </h2><p>  From the labels on their containers to their ingredients lists, these drinks certainly give off “I’m good for you” vibes. </p><p>  The company that makes Aura Bora sparkling waters, for example, which contain fragrant herbal extracts such as lavender and elderflower, describes its drinks as delivering “earthly tastes and heavenly feelings.” On its website, Ruby says its Sparkling Hibiscus drinks, which typically contain unusual juices such as those made from blood oranges or Fuji apples, have “1,000+ benefits.” </p><p>  Naked Juice’s Green Machine, one of the numerous “green” drinks in grocery and deli refrigerator cases, features ingredients such as kale and spirulina. And you can’t miss the images of broccoli, spinach leaves, green apples and kiwis on its label. </p><p>  Wellness waters such as those from Aura Bora and Ruby can make a nice change from regular seltzer. Plus, they have no added sugars or sugar alternatives. And if you’re keeping an eye on calories, Aura Bora has none and Ruby has just 15 (from its juice). </p><p>  As for those produce-packed green drinks, “they’re an easy and convenient way to get some vitamins and minerals in your diet,” said Tracey Brigman, a clinical associate professor of nutrition at the University of Georgia in Athens. </p><p>  But keep in mind that green drinks shouldn’t be a replacement for eating vegetables, because they have little or none of the healthy fiber found in whole produce. Plus, some green drinks are actually mostly fruit (not vegetable) juice. Although it’s natural, the sugar in fruit juice does add calories and can even cause blood sugar spikes. </p><p>  So if you like green drinks, it’s a smart move to opt for those that have vegetables high on their ingredient lists. </p><h2>  <b>The promise: Less stress</b> </h2><p>  Drinks that are meant to improve your mood are fast becoming the new cocktails. Instead of taking the edge off with alcohol, beverages like Recess and Droplet supposedly get their relaxing effects from “adaptogens” such as ashwagandha or mushrooms and nutrients such as magnesium. All are said to help your brain and body cope with stress. </p><p>  These drinks can make a flavorful, alcohol-free alternative to a glass of wine or a cocktail. But most of the research on adaptogens has been limited to animals, and the few human studies were very small, Brigman said. </p><p>  Ashwagandha, for instance, was found to reduce stressful feelings and levels of the stress hormone cortisol in people who took 250 to 600 milligrams daily for eight weeks. But that study, which was published in the journal Cureus in 2019, measured stress levels in just 58 people. </p><p>  Plus, the “efficacy and potency of plant-based ingredients vary depending on where and how they were grown, when they were harvested and what part of the plants were used,” Brigman said. Although some brands list the amount of adaptogens they contain, there is little clarity on what an effective “dose” of an adaptogen may be. </p><p>  In addition, researchers have found that adaptogens may interact with some medications, such as those for autoimmune conditions, high blood pressure and depression. For that reason, “you should always talk with your health-care provider prior to adding these to your diet,” Brigman said. </p></main>
