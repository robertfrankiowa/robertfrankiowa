She reveals "that one meal" was a whopping 2,390 calories – more than she eats in a day now.</p><h2>2 What Not to Order: Quesaritos</h2><p>The first two items on her order? "I would get two Quesaritos. Yes, two," she says. "Each for 650 calories a piece." The item, no longer on the menu, was a quesadilla-burrito with a quesadilla rolled and filled with seasoned beef, creamy chipotle sauce, reduced-fat sour cream, nacho cheese sauce, and seasoned rice.</p><h2>3 What Not to Order: Chalupa Supreme</h2><p>Her next item? "One Chalupa Supreme for 360 calories," she says. According to Taco Bell, the item consists of a traditional flatbread with seasoned beef, a three-cheese blend, lettuce, tomatoes, and reduced fat sour cream that is deep fried like a funnel cake.</p><figure><img title="3 What Not to Order: Chalupa Supreme" src="IMG/BB1ovm0h_3_what_not_to_order_chalupa_supreme.jpg" alt="3 What Not to Order: Chalupa Supreme"><figcaption><em>3 What Not to Order: Chalupa Supreme. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 What Not to Order: Two Soft Shell Tacos</h2><p>She also ordered "two soft shell tacos for 370 calories," she says. Soft shell tacos generally consist of a tortilla with ground beef, cheese, and any other fixings.</p><h2>5 What Not to Order: Dr. Pepper</h2><p>In most of Amber's videos, she highlights how you can easily drink your calories. At Taco Bell, she would order a large Dr Pepper for 360 calories.</p><h2>6 What to Order Instead: Two Chicken Soft Taco Supremes</h2><p>Now, instead of beef, she gets two Chicken soft Taco Supremes. She claims that these total 370 calories.</p><h2>7 What to Order Instead: Side of Chips and Cheese</h2><p>She also gets a side of chips and cheese, which offers some crunch. This adds just 220 calories, bringing her total to 590 calories.</p><h2>8 What to Order Instead: Chicken Power Bowl</h2><p>"Or I get the chicken power bowl for 40," she says about the protein-packed meal. "You can have fast food in moderation."</p><figure><img title="8 What to Order Instead: Chicken Power Bowl" src="IMG/BB1mqBTZ_8_what_to_order_instead_chicken_power_bowl.jpg" alt="8 What to Order Instead: Chicken Power Bowl"><figcaption><em>8 What to Order Instead: Chicken Power Bowl. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 What to Order Instead: Black Bean Chalupa Supreme</h2><h2>10 What to Order Instead: Crunchy Taco</h2><p>She also likes the crunchy tacos, "made from a whole grain corn," she says, noting that the Chalupa, burrito, and quesadilla "all have enriched grains as their first ingredient," she says. "Whole grain is always a great option. More nutritious and also gonna give you that crunch that, I mean, who doesn't go to Taco Bell for the crunch?" She notes that she "got rid of the seasoned beef and traded up for chicken, beans, guac, cheese, all real whole food ingredients and so delicious, filled with flavor. Always spicy for me." The total? 300 calories.</p><h2>11 What to Order Instead: Crunchwrap Supreme</h2><p>"I mean, as if you didn't love Taco Bell oh-so-much already, you can actually trade out the ground beef in the Crunchwrap Supreme and trade up for the steak. I mean, if that's not a luxury lunch, I don't know what it is. I added real whole food ingredients like guac, black beans, cheese, and all the veg," she says about the 550-calorie meal.</p><h2>12 Don't Put Too Much Focus on the Numbers</h2><p>In a recent TikTok video, Amber answers a question she gets: "What are some unexpected things about weight loss that I wish I had known going into it?" she says. "So here are some things I wish I would've known about weight loss going into my 160-pound weight loss journey." "Number one, the scale means a lot less than you think it does," says Amber. "The scale is literally going to change 24-freaking-7.</p><h2>13 Track Your Weight Over a Longer Period of Time</h2><p>She points out that weight fluctuates due to a variety of factors, including water weight, inflammation, if you have to go to the bathroom, food that needs to be digested, body fat, muscle, "everything," she says. "So that number matters a lot less day to day than you think it does. What you wanna go for is an overall downward trend over a long period of time."</p><h2>14 You Might Become Obsessed with "Body Checking" Yourself</h2><p>"Number two, you will become obsessed with body-checking yourself," says Amber. "I cannot tell you I was looking for every single little ounce of progress that I could see day to day. Do I like it all the time? No, but it's definitely something that I experienced."</p><figure><img title="14 You Might Become Obsessed with " body="" checking"="" yourself"="" src="IMG/BB1lEtOU_14_you_might_become_obsessed_with_body_checking_yourself.jpg" alt="14 You Might Become Obsessed with " body="" checking"="" yourself"=""><figcaption><em>14 You Might Become Obsessed with "Body Checking" Yourself. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>15 You Need to Be in a Calorie Deficit</h2><p>"Number three, a calorie deficit is a calorie deficit," Amber says. "It doesn't matter what you call it. Every single program out there is only going to work if you're in a calorie deficit. So if you try something that feels really unsustainable to you, you don't have to do that thing because, in general, for most people, if you're in a calorie deficit, you will lose weight. There's not some magic secret out there. The secret is a calorie deficit."</p><h2>16 You Will Learn People's True Character</h2><p>"Number four, you will learn people's true characters on a weight loss journey," Amber reveals. "You might lose friends. You might realize how fat-phobic some people in your life really are, and people will be a lot more comfortable being fat-phobic around you because they think you are automatically fat-phobic because you lost weight. And people will say some really bizarre crazy things around you."</p><h2>17 You Will Realize Thin Privilege Is Real</h2><p>"Number five, you will realize just how much of a thin thin privilege really is," Amber confesses. The way that people treat me, so vastly different now because I'm in a smaller body versus when I was 300 pounds, insane," she reveals.
