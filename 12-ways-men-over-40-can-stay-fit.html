    <main><h1>12 Ways Men Over 40 Can Stay Fit</h1><p>Want to turn your dadbod into a fitbod? You've come to the right place. I have been coaching for 20+ years, with a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Exercise Science, as well as several fitness certifications. And over that time, tons of dads have come to me, looking to get fit. Maybe they want more energy to keep up with their children; maybe they want to live long enough to see them graduate, or maybe they want to feel attractive to their partners.  The more obvious benefits of fitness are improved physical health, better joint health and flexibility, and longevity and quality of life. However, other positives for dads (and anyone) include improved mental and emotional health, increased energy levels, better sleep, improved cognitive function, and social connections. Not to mention the role model you are providing for your kids and family. Read on for 12 ways to turn your dadbod into a fitbod.</p><figure><img title="12 Ways Men Over 40 Can Stay Fit" src="IMG/BB1mG30w_12_ways_men_over_40_can_stay_fit.jpg" alt="12 Ways Men Over 40 Can Stay Fit"><figcaption><em>12 Ways Men Over 40 Can Stay Fit. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 Personalized Approach to Health</h2><p>There are many avenues to fitness and nutrition. Choose those that work for you and can be maintained long-term. There is no one "best" way to health. The best way for you is the one that works, and you can adhere to long term. Otherwise, you fall into the roller coaster pattern of health that most understand.</p><h2>2 Goal Setting</h2><p>Set realistic goals. Your goals need to be achievable and objective. Use numbers and tangible measurements and understand your limits and lifestyle. Saying you want under 10% body fat may not be realistic for you and is quite likely not even necessary or needed.</p><h2>3 Workout Routine Balance</h2><p>Create a balanced workout routine incorporating muscular strength, endurance, cardiovascular exercise, and flexibility. Balance and variety are key. If you only focus on one thing, you will most definitely develop weaknesses and inefficiencies in others. These can lead to injuries or other issues down the road.</p><h2>4 Importance of Nutrition</h2><p>Nutrition matters. You may have heard, "You can't outwork a bad diet". This is more true than most realize, and even more imperative as we get older. Eating healthier will change everything in your life drastically. Way more so than any amount of exercise.</p><h2>5 Sleep and Stress Management</h2><p>Sleep and stress matter. If you're not getting enough sleep and you're constantly in distress, exercise and nutrition can become irrelevant. Your body will never be in a state to grow or improve as it will always be in recovery or survival mode.</p><figure><img title="5 Sleep and Stress Management" src="IMG/BB1mFRxT_5_sleep_and_stress_management.jpg" alt="5 Sleep and Stress Management"><figcaption><em>5 Sleep and Stress Management. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 The Role of Hydration</h2><p>Hydration matters. People forget about drinking enough water. Not only is it necessary for basic needs and survival but it can improve sleep, mood, cognition, and can keep you full when you "think" you're hungry.</p><h2>7 Benefits of Strength Training</h2><p>Strength training is a must. After age 30 we lose something around 3-8% of muscle mass every decade. If you're not strength training, likely more. This might not matter to you now but at some point you're not going to be able to live independently. I'd like to be self sufficient as late into life as possible.</p><h2>8 Consistency Over Perfection</h2><p>Consistency is key. Focus on being in this for the long haul, for a lifetime. This isn't a 6 week bootcamp. Being consistent with diet and exercise are the most important. It might not always be the best workout ever, and you will slip on nutrition from time to time. That's life. However, being as consistent as you can, as often as you can, will make all of the difference over the course of a lifetime.</p><figure><img title="8 Consistency Over Perfection" src="IMG/BB1mFYlX_8_consistency_over_perfection.jpg" alt="8 Consistency Over Perfection"><figcaption><em>8 Consistency Over Perfection. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Listening to Your Body</h2><p>Listen to your body. If you need a break, take one, or go a little easier that day. Don't use this as an excuse but understanding your limits and needs will improve your overall fitness, prevent injuries, overtraining, and burnout.</p><h2>10 Embracing Imperfection</h2><p>You can be fit without perfection (in diet, in training, in lifestyle). Remember to enjoy life! No one is perfect, nor can they be. You're going to have off days, and that's okay. Don't beat yourself up about it or give up entirely. Just regroup, chalk it up to experience, and start again tomorrow.</p><h2>11 Mistakes to Avoid</h2><p>Here are common mistakes people should avoid to maintain a fit body:</p><p>1. Trying to make drastic or too strict of changes to diet and fitness. More often than not, these things are not sustainable long term.</p><p>2. Neglecting warm-up/cool-down that includes mobility and flexibility work.</p><p>3. Focusing primarily on aesthetics.</p><figure><img title="11 Mistakes to Avoid" src="IMG/BB1mcZOL_11_mistakes_to_avoid.jpg" alt="11 Mistakes to Avoid"><figcaption><em>11 Mistakes to Avoid. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>12 Don't Overcomplicate This!</h2><p>All too often, people overcomplicate health and fitness. Keep it simple. Eat real foods when possible. Exercise daily. Practice moderation. Focus on the lifelong journey, not the six week bootcamps.
