    <main><h1>Surprising Health Benefits of Your Family’s Favorite Snacks</h1><p><strong>We all love indulging in our favorite snacks, but did you know they might be healthier than you think? Here are 19 popular “junk food” snacks that come with some surprising health benefits.</strong></p><h2>1. Dark Chocolate</h2><p>Dark chocolate is rich in antioxidants, which can improve heart health by lowering blood pressure and improving blood flow. It’s also known to boost brain function and mood, making it a guilt-free treat.</p><h2>2. Popcorn</h2><p>When air-popped and lightly seasoned, popcorn is a low-calorie, whole-grain snack high in fiber. It can help with digestion and keep you feeling full longer, making it a healthier alternative to chips.</p><h2>3. Peanut Butter</h2><p>Peanut butter is a good source of protein and healthy fats. It helps control hunger, stabilizes blood sugar levels, and provides long-lasting energy, especially when paired with whole-grain crackers or fruit.</p><h2>4. Potato Chips</h2><p>While often considered unhealthy, potato chips made with olive oil and baked instead of fried can be a source of potassium. This essential mineral helps maintain proper muscle function and electrolyte balance.</p><h2>5. Ice Cream</h2><p>Moderate consumption of ice cream can provide calcium and vitamin D, which are important for bone health. Opt for versions with lower sugar and higher protein content for a more balanced treat.</p><figure><img title="5. Ice Cream" src="IMG/BB1mZliV_5_ice_cream.jpg" alt="5. Ice Cream"><figcaption><em>5.
