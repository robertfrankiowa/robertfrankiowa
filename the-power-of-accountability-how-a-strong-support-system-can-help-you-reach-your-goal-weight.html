    <main><h1>The Power of Accountability: How a Strong Support System Can Help You Reach Your Goal Weight</h1><p>Losing weight can be tough, and you’ll likely face several obstacles throughout your journey. From weight loss plateaus to fighting temptations of less healthy foods, it can sometimes be difficult to maintain motivation.</p><p>When you feel discouraged (or want to keep yourself from falling into a slump), it’s best to lean into tried-and-true strategies to help you stay on track. Accountability is a method that can effectively get you to the finish line of your weight loss goals.</p><h2>What Is Accountability and How Does It Help With Weight Loss?</h2><p>Generally, being accountable means taking responsibility for your actions. When it comes to weight loss, accountability can be critical in helping you achieve your goals.</p><p>“Many of us set out to make lifestyle changes to become the healthiest version of ourselves,” says Elizabeth Simkus, DNP, medical director of the Rush Prevention Center at Rush University System for Health in Chicago and an expert in lifestyle medicine. “Accountability is being held responsible for doing what we said we were going to do.”</p><h2>Types of Accountability</h2><p>Accountability exists in several forms, and each can impact your success differently. “Finding what works for each person is individualized and may change over time,” Simkus notes.</p><p>Throughout your weight loss journey, you may use multiple types of accountability at once or rely heavily on one form. Here’s a closer look at the different types of accountability for weight loss.</p><h3>Personal Accountability</h3><p>Personal accountability means staying accountable to yourself and your own goals on your weight loss journey.</p><p>“Personal accountability is where someone tracks their own behaviors, actions, and weight loss progress, and can make adjustments by themselves to achieve their desired weight loss targets,” says Michelle Routhenstein, RDN, CDCES, a preventive cardiology dietitian at EntirelyNourished.com based in New York City.</p><p>This type of accountability can include keeping track of your caloric intake and physical activity in a food diary or tracking app like Lose It!, monitoring your weight at home with a scale, setting goals, and tracking your progress over time.</p><h3>Social Accountability</h3><p>Social accountability involves relying on a social network for support and motivation in achieving your goals.</p><p>“We are more likely to sustain lifestyle changes if we surround ourselves with people [who have] a similar journey and interests,” Simkus says.</p><p>One study of 386 middle-age and older adults found that participants who received social support for dietary changes made healthier food decisions, including eating more fruits and vegetables and drinking more water than those without social support.</p><p>Social accountability includes having a workout buddy, joining group classes, or participating in groups or communities that help each other stay accountable in their weight loss goals, Routhenstein notes.</p><h3>Professional Accountability</h3><p>Professional accountability includes working with an expert like a registered dietitian, personal trainer, or health coach to provide guidance and support through science-based nutrition to help you meet your health and weight loss goals.</p><p>It can also include visits to your primary care doctor, nurse practitioner, or other healthcare specialist you see regularly to help you manage your weight.</p><h2>The Building Blocks of Accountability</h2><p>Along with different types of accountability, there are many tools and methods that can help hold you accountable during your weight loss journey.</p><h3>Setting Goals</h3><p>The first step to staying accountable is to think through your health and weight loss goals. Research shows that setting personal targets increases the likelihood of achieving weight loss.</p><p>“When you set clear, measurable goals, it provides direction and motivation so you can stay focused to meet your health and weight loss goals,” Routhenstein says.</p><p>Jackson Haen, RD, CSCS, sports dietitian at Memorial Hermann | Rockets Sports Medicine Institute in Houston, recommends following the SMART model when devising your goals.</p><p>“Goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely to set you up for success in the long term,” he says. “Working with a health professional to help you set goals is a great way to create a plan of action that fits your individual needs and lifestyle.”</p><h3>Developing a Plan of Action</h3><p>Once you have your goals, it’s important to have a plan to tackle them. It can be helpful to write out how you plan to achieve your goals in a journal or on an app.</p><p>For example, Simkus notes that if she has a client whose goal is to lose a certain number of pounds in the next month, she works with them to tease out what they would need to tweak or change in their lifestyle to achieve that goal. “Examples include ‘I will not eat after 7 p.m. over the next four weeks’ or ‘I will eat at least two servings of vegetables per day, three times per week, over the next four weeks,’” she says.</p><h3>Tracking Your Progress</h3><p>Research shows that tracking diet and physical activity is an effective intervention to support weight loss. One study of 142 adults with an average body mass index (BMI) of 35.8 (in the obese category) found that those who recorded their food intake during a six-month weight-control intervention were more likely to successfully lose 5 to 10 percent of their starting weight than those who did not self-monitor.</p><p>A variety of tools can track the progress of your weight loss goals. “For those who like pen-and-paper options, there are great habit-tracking calendars or notebooks,” Simkus says. “Using stickers to mark when a SMART goal for the day is achieved can be motivating.”</p><p>Many people prefer tracking goals digitally in an app like Lose It! or a spreadsheet.</p><h3>Accountability Partners</h3><p>Whether it’s a friend, a family member, or an in-person or online support group, accountability partners can help give you the motivation you need on your journey.</p><p>“Accountability partners help you work through progress and challenges and celebrate successes to increase adherence to healthy behaviors to help you achieve your set goals,” Routhenstein says.</p><p>Plenty of scientific research shows this is true. One study of 704 individuals — 89 percent of whom were overweight or had obesity — who were enrolled in a 15-week online weight loss program found that those who participated with a buddy lost more weight and inches from their waist than those who went through the program without peer support.</p><p>Check-ins with a registered dietitian or other credentialed healthcare professional can be important for accountability and motivation.</p><p>“I have heard time and time again how easy it is to start off strong right after our visit, but then that habits begin to slip or revert to old habits after a week or two,” Simkus says. “Having regular check-ins can be an effective tool to keep you on track.”</p><p>A systematic review of 34 studies on weight loss interventions found that a higher number of check-ins between patients and providers (12 or more) led to more significant weight loss.</p><h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2><p>Of course, no matter how many tools we have at our disposal, there will undoubtedly be challenges along any weight loss journey. Oftentimes, this can be the result of trying to accomplish too much at once.</p><p>“Many people get overwhelmed when trying to pursue weight loss by making a lot of big changes quickly,” Haen says. “They may not be ready to track calories, completely change their diet, or overhaul their lifestyle.”</p><p>In these instances, refocusing and taking small steps is key. “Setting simple, attainable goals, like reducing the number of times you eat out a week, limiting occasional foods like sweets, [restricting] ‘junk food,’ etc., to once a week, or adding in exercise a few times a week can be more impactful to build long-term adherence,” Haen says.</p><p>Another idea to consider: Choose only one or two SMART goals, and then add more once they are achieved.</p><p>Other times, life simply gets in the way. “It’s often easier not to do some of the necessary lifestyle changes to meet our health goals,” Simkus says. “We are all busy, and it is difficult to commit to self-care and focusing on yourself. I remind my patients (and myself) that self-care is necessary to be able to show up as the best version of ourselves for others.”</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>The weight loss journey isn't easy, but personal tracking and outside support can help you stay accountable for the choices you make along the way — which can increase your chances of success. Reach out to others for help, remain honest with yourself, and develop plans and routines to guide you as you progress. With every step, you'll get closer to your goal.</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
