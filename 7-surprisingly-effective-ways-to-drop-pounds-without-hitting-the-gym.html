    <main><h1>7 Surprisingly Effective Ways to Drop Pounds Without Hitting the Gym</h1><h2>1 Drink Water in the Morning</h2><p>"Here's a fun piece of info for you: Your body doesn't actually know the difference between hunger and thirst," says Hanji. "By the time you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated, so make sure that you start your day by drinking half a liter to a liter of water to obviously be a hydrated queen and also to help you be more satiated."</p><h2>2 This Is How Much Water You Should Drink</h2><p>What should your daily hydration goal be? The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that men should drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day and women, 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids.</p><figure><img title="2 This Is How Much Water You Should Drink" src="IMG/BB1lMlT6_2_this_is_how_much_water_you_should_drink.jpg" alt="2 This Is How Much Water You Should Drink"><figcaption><em>2 This Is How Much Water You Should Drink. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Eat a Protein-Packed Breakfast</h2><p>"Talking about morning stuff, you also want to be having at least 30 grams of protein in your breakfast," says Hanji. "This is to help keep you satiated during the day and also to help you prevent any muscle loss because you don't want to end up like an inflated balloon when you lose weight. You want to make sure that you lose it from body fat, so to prevent that, you're going to want to eat enough protein."</p><h2>4 Protein Helps You Lose Fat and Keep Muscle</h2><p>Why is protein so important? Not only does it keep you feeling full and satiated throughout the day, but clinical trials have found that amping up your intake not only reduces body weight (BW) but also enhances body composition by decreasing fat mass while preserving fat-free mass (FFM) in both low-calorie and standard-calorie diets.</p><figure><img title="4 Protein Helps You Lose Fat and Keep Muscle" src="IMG/BB1nRaq2_4_protein_helps_you_lose_fat_and_keep_muscle.jpg" alt="4 Protein Helps You Lose Fat and Keep Muscle"><figcaption><em>4 Protein Helps You Lose Fat and Keep Muscle. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Go On a Hot Girl Walk</h2><p>Next up, "You want to go on a hot girl walk," recommends Hanji. "I know that this might be a bit more effort than you were expecting, but going on a 20 to 30-minute walk first thing in the morning is not only going to help boost your activity levels throughout the day, but it's also going to help reset your mind. It's going to be an amazing time for you to listen to a podcast and to just be in nature and be a bit mindful."</p><h2>6 Other Benefits of Walking</h2><p>Weight loss isn't the only benefit of walking. One study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</p><h2>7 Do Squats, Lunges, and Pushups Throughout the Day</h2><p>"Okay, this fourth one is actually my favorite and the weirdest one. This is going to help you maintain the curves where you want them to be," says Hanji. "So whenever you arrive at the office, every single time you go to the bathroom, I want you to be doing ten squats, ten lunges per leg, and ten incline pushups on the sink to make sure that you're working out those muscles without having to go to the gym."</p><h2>8 Aim for 150 Minutes of Moderate Exercise</h2><p>Each week, adults need 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity, according to the current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.</p><h2>9 Grab a Protein Bar Instead of Chocolate</h2><p>"My fifth tip is actually going to be a small swap that I want you to make. Next time you go shopping for that chocolate bar. I want you to grab a protein bar instead because it's not only going to help you satisfy your cravings for chocolate, but it's also going to give you some extra boost of protein, which is, again, going to help you preserve that muscle mass so you don't end up looking like a deflated balloon as you lose weight," Hanji says.</p><figure><img title="9 Grab a Protein Bar Instead of Chocolate" src="IMG/BB1lyIKI_9_grab_a_protein_bar_instead_of_chocolate.jpg" alt="9 Grab a Protein Bar Instead of Chocolate"><figcaption><em>9 Grab a Protein Bar Instead of Chocolate. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10 Walk for Five Minutes Every Hour</h2><p>Hanji recommends using your phone for the next suggestion. "You want to set an alarm or a timer for every hour, so every maybe 55 minutes, I want this to go off, and I want you to get up. The moment you hear that alarm or you feel that buzz on your wrist, I want you to get up and walk around the office for about five minutes just to increase your energy expenditure this way," Hanji says.</p><figure><img title="10 Walk for Five Minutes Every Hour" src="IMG/BB1nRf73_10_walk_for_five_minutes_every_hour.jpg" alt="10 Walk for Five Minutes Every Hour"><figcaption><em>10 Walk for Five Minutes Every Hour. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>11 Combine Your Walks to Burn More Calories</h2><p>"Combining this with your hot girl walk in the morning, you're going to basically increase your energy expenditure and put yourself further into a calorie deficit," Hanji says.</p><h2>12 Only Let Yourself Watch Netflix or YouTube When You Are Doing Cardio</h2><p>"The last step that I have for you today is basically limiting your Netflix and YouTube time only for cardio," says Hanji. "I want you to get on that treadmill and have some fun. Watch your favorite show, or a YouTube video. Enjoy that time and limit your watch time to only the times when you're doing cardio. This is where you're going to be basically combining fun with progress. Who doesn't love that?"
