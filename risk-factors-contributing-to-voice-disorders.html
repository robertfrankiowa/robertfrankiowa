    <main><h1>Risk Factors Contributing To Voice Disorders</h1><h2>Colds And Upper Respiratory Infections</h2><p>Among the most common risk factors that contribute to voice disorders are colds and upper respiratory infections. These viral infections directly cause issues with the upper respiratory system, which can cause individuals to experience a voice disorder. Both of these infections are very common and should resolve themselves within a couple of weeks. However, it's possible for the symptoms of these infections to cause additional complications such as a voice disorder. When a patient suffers from a cold or an upper respiratory infection, some of the components within the upper airways will become inflamed, which can include the larynx and trachea. The larynx is positioned right at the top of the trachea and consists of the vocal cords. When this area becomes inflamed and swollen, it's possible the patient's vocal cords will be damaged, which can result in a voice disorder. The inflammation of the larynx is referred to as laryngitis. Unless the infection patients suffer from is severe, this inflammation and swelling should dissipate within a few weeks, which is when their voice should go back to normal.</p><p>Learn more about the risk factors contributing to the development of voice disorders now.</p><figure><img title="Colds And Upper Respiratory Infections" src="IMG/BB1lZLtW_colds_and_upper_respiratory_infections.jpg" alt="Colds And Upper Respiratory Infections"><figcaption><em>Colds And Upper Respiratory Infections.

Continuous improper throat clearing is one such form of vocal abuse that could cause a range of complications if individuals don't lessen how often they clear their throat. It's also important to understand individuals feeling as though they need to clear their throat constantly could be the sign of an underlying condition like a food allergy, postnasal drainage, or a reflux condition. Whether patients clear their throat because they feel like something is stuck there or because the act of doing so has become a habit, this improper throat clearing will damage their vocal cords over time, which means they will experience a voice disorder. The damage to the vocal cords could be long-lasting if individuals don't notice their voice changing right away. In most cases, clearing the throat improperly will cause the vocal cords to become inflamed, which is why a voice disorder develops.</p><p>Continue reading to reveal more risk factors for voice disorders now.</p><figure><img title="Continuous Improper Throat Clearing" src="IMG/AA1niCUS_continuous_improper_throat_clearing.jpg" alt="Continuous Improper Throat Clearing"><figcaption><em>Continuous Improper Throat Clearing.

In order to lessen the severity of the voice disorder the patient is experiencing, it's important to identify what is causing the allergic reaction. If patients suffer from seasonal allergies and are allergic to tree, grass, or weed pollen, it's highly recommended for them to avoid spending too much time outdoors on days with a high pollen count. Doing so could exacerbate their seasonal allergies and lead to more damage to their vocal cords. If patients find an allergy has created problems with their vocal cords, they should consider taking medications to alleviate the allergy. They should also drink plenty of water. While these problems should lessen over time, patients should also certainly visit a doctor if they're still experiencing problems with their vocal cords after the allergy has dissipated. Other allergy types that could contribute to the development of a voice disorder include drug, food, and animal allergies.</p><p>Learn more about what increases the risk of a voice disorder developing now.</p><figure><img title="Allergies" src="IMG/BB1lZOc6_allergies.jpg" alt="Allergies"><figcaption><em>Allergies.

A very common symptom that occurs when suffering from one of these cancers includes changes to the voice. If cancer develops in an individual's voice box or larynx, it's almost a certainty they will begin to suffer from a voice disorder. The same is true if cancer started in one of the surrounding areas but has since spread to the larynx. The changes in a patient's voice will likely be accompanied by a sore throat and difficulties with swallowing because of the presence of a lump within the affected area. Smoking is among the most common reasons a cancer of this kind occurs, which is why it's important for individuals to take measures to stop smoking now if they want to reduce their risk of contracting such a disease. If the cancer is located in the larynx, surgery may need to be used to remove the tumor. If so, the voice disorder could be permanent.</p><p>Get more information regarding the risk factors associated with voice disorders.</p><figure><img title="Throat Cancer" src="IMG/BB1lFnJ2_throat_cancer.jpg" alt="Throat Cancer"><figcaption><em>Throat Cancer.

If individuals suffer from thyroid issues, the dysfunction they're experiencing could bring about a voice disorder. These issues refer to any dysfunction of the thyroid gland, which could include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, goiter, or thyroid cancer. Since the thyroid is situated just below the larynx, any dysfunction of the thyroid can lead to issues within the larynx, which could heighten a patient's risk of suffering from a voice disorder. When the thyroid is functioning properly, it will produce various thyroid hormones that control numerous functions throughout the body, which includes metabolism. If the thyroid no longer produces enough of these hormones, the patient's voice will likely become hoarse, which is considered a voice disorder. Other reasons for a voice disorder to occur because of thyroid problems include the presence of a growth on the thyroid or a large goiter.</p></main>
