    <main><h1>I Lost 100 Pounds With These Healthy Habits</h1><p>At the age of 19, Jarred Curcio, Owner of TRUE Fitness & Focus, stood at 5'8' and weighed nearly 300 lbs. "I was extremely overweight," he tells Body Network. However, by his 21st birthday, he was a natural bodybuilding champion competing at 175lbs. Fifteen years later, he has "stayed consistent at 200lbs – mostly muscle mass. I have a 6-pack, I squat 550 lbs, and I can deadlift 600 lbs." Here is exactly how he transformed his life and got started on his health journey, which resulted in a 125-pound weight loss – and how he has maintained it throughout the years.</p><h2>1 Weight Loss Transformed His Life</h2><p>Jarred explains that physical fitness has been a huge part of his life since his weight loss journey. "I can honestly say I never missed a workout in that time," he tells us. He uses the principles he learned in the gym – discipline, consistency, resilience, doing the hard things, "even when you don't want to – and applies them to other areas of his life, including his career and relationships.</p><h2>2 A Journey of Achievement and Lasting Love</h2><p>"This has allowed me to be successful in every area of my life," he says. "I graduated college summa cum laude and completed Penn State Law School toward the top of my class. I have had a very fruitful and rewarding career in sales leadership since 2013. And I am married to my high school sweetheart of 19 years – who also had a weight loss journey of her own at the same time. Our relationship could not be stronger!"</p><h2>3 He Believes Mental and Physical Health Go Hand-in-Hand</h2><p>Jarred believes that mental and physical health go hand-in-hand. "I am a believer that there is an opportunity to get the average person to a state of mental fitness or mental performance," he says. "This would mean not simply eliminating anxiety or depression, but building skills and abilities to help committed individuals thrive on a day-to-day basis." His own weight loss journey was the primer for this belief and lifestyle shift.</p><figure><img title="3 He Believes Mental and Physical Health Go Hand-in-Hand" src="IMG/BB1oVvPx_3_he_believes_mental_and_physical_health_go_hand_in_hand.jpg" alt="3 He Believes Mental and Physical Health Go Hand-in-Hand"><figcaption><em>3 He Believes Mental and Physical Health Go Hand-in-Hand. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Now, He Wants to Help Others</h2><p>This is why he is embarking on a career to help others. "I have developed my philosophy and programming continuously over the past 15 years. Now, I feel I have enough of a grasp to provide immense value to others and help them accomplish the same successes that I have," he says.</p><h2>5 He Believes Discipline Offers Freedom</h2><p>"I am a believer that learning discipline offers the greatest freedom possible as it instills a sense of agency in a person. I have developed a system for building habits and cultivating discipline that includes physical workouts but goes far beyond that. My system includes mindfulness practices like meditation and stoic habits like demonstrating gratitude."</p><h2>6 His Top 5 Exercises</h2><p>Jarred's top 5 exercises are deadlift, squat, kettlebell swings, pull-ups, and military press. "These exercises are big compound movements that require the use of major muscle groups. These are basic yet critical movements that help build significant muscle and strength if performed properly," he says.</p><figure><img title="6 His Top 5 Exercises" src="IMG/BB1oVAyR_6_his_top_5_exercises.jpg" alt="6 His Top 5 Exercises"><figcaption><em>6 His Top 5 Exercises. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 These Exercises Build Muscle and Burn Fat</h2><p>"The more body parts you move, the more calories you burn. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn. The more weight you move, the more calories you burn. So these exercises will not only make you more muscular and stronger, but they will also burn fat and improve athletic capacity across a range of activities or sports."</p><h2>8 Here Is His Daily Diet</h2><p>"I eat an animal-based diet, which means I prioritize animal proteins (beef, chicken, eggs, etc.) as a primary factor in my meals," Jarred explains. The next highest priority in his diet is eating natural healthy fats, "most of which also come from animals, including butter, milk, and Greek or Icelandic yogurt," he says. "I feel carbs are important but can be easily overeaten.</p><figure><img title="8 Here Is His Daily Diet" src="IMG/BB1lodsL_8_here_is_his_daily_diet.jpg" alt="8 Here Is His Daily Diet"><figcaption><em>8 Here Is His Daily Diet. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 He Sticks to Fruits, Rice, and Potatoes</h2><p>When it comes to carbs, I mostly stick to fruit (almost any fruit will do), white rice, and potatoes." He also eats vegetables, "but quite sparingly," he says. "I keep my vegetable consumption to about twice per week," he also avoids most processed foods, seed oils, and refined sugars. "Whole, organic foods are always going to be the best options." He warns that "sugar is snuck into so much of the food we eat that we have to be on the lookout."</p><h2>10 His 1 Tip</h2><p>"My #1 tip is to find a realistic process (diet and exercise) that works for you, but should also challenge you. No change comes without discomfort," says Jarred. "Once you find the plan, STICK TO IT NO MATTER WHAT! No excuse should be enough to break from the plan. If you do that, the results are guaranteed. "Once you get the results, you'll never want to go back."</p><h2>11 One Fitness Myth, Busted</h2><p>The biggest fitness myth, according to Jarred? "You cannot spot reduce,'' he says. "For example, some people think if you do a bunch of sit-ups, you will get 6-pack abs. But abs are revealed when you lose fat. Losing fat comes from a calorie deficit, and diet is CRITICAL to that. So sit-ups can burn calories and can strengthen ab muscles, but will not get you a 6-pack on their own."</p><h2>12 He Takes Supplements</h2><p>Here is Jarred's list of supplements:</p><p>Multivitamin – The classic all-in-one supplement</p><p>Omega-3 – Critical for heart health</p><p>Desiccated Beef Liver – Alpha shit</p><p>ZMA – Zinc and Magnesium before bed for great sleep and recovery</p><p>Glutamine – Amino Acid found in red meat. Outstanding for post-workout recovery.</p><p>Creatine – Super amino acid that helps grow muscle and helps with brain health</p><p>BCAAs – Branched chain amino acids are critical to recovery.</p><p>Alpha-Jym – Great testosterone booster w/ ashwagandha & fenugreek</p><p>Tribulus – Testosterone booster</p><p>DHEA – Testosterone booster</p><p>Longjack (Tongkat Ali) – Testosterone booster and sexual health</p><p>Turmeric – Anti-inflammatory</p><p>Vitamin B – Metabolism & Energy</p><p>Vitamin D – All-around immunity and bone health</p><p>Spirulina – Blue-green algae with tons of micronutrients and health benefits</p><p>CLA – Helps with metabolism and body composition (non-stimulant fat burning)</p><p>Zinc – Immune support</p><p>Glucosamine – Joint Health</p><p>Potassium – Water regulation</p><p>Taurine – Nervous system function</p><p>Biotin – Hair, nails, skin</p><p>DIM – Balances estrogen naturally</p><h2>13 Here Is How He Measures Progress</h2><p>Jarred measures his progress by how he feels in the day, his "energy levels, mental clarity, how my body moves at the gym, how I look in the mirror, and how I fit in my clothes," he says. When he feels bad about his body, he takes action and checks his diet to see if he has been taking in more calories lately than typical and adjusts accordingly.</p><figure><img title="13 Here Is How He Measures Progress" src="IMG/BB1oVypE_13_here_is_how_he_measures_progress.jpg" alt="13 Here Is How He Measures Progress"><figcaption><em>13 Here Is How He Measures Progress. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>14 His Final Piece of Advice? Know Your Why</h2><p>His final piece of advice? "Know your 'WHY,'" he says. "If you know WHY you are starting, it's the key to staying consistent and disciplined." If you need motivation, remind yourself of your goals and "visualize and manifest" them. "The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. If your body isn't physically healthy, you can't expect your mind to be healthy. If your mind isn't healthy, you make worse decisions. Worst decisions lead to a worse quality of life. A healthy body is the foundation for a happy life." And if you enjoyed this article, take advantage of these 15 Quick Ways to Lose Body Fat Percentage in a Week.</p></main>
