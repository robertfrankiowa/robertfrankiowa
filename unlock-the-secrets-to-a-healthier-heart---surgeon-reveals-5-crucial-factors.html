They face a heart procedure, a minor or even a major one, or they have already been through a lot and fear that it was not enough, that their heart remains sick. I understand their concern, their fear. If they were not at all affected by the situation, I would find it strange. After all, we are dealing with a defect in the central organ of their life.</p><p>What I often wonder about, however, is the carelessness with which many people have neglected their heart's health until the case of emergency actually occurred. I simply do not understand this. Most people regularly bring their car in for inspection, they also book their vacation well in advance, and they know when their mortgage will be paid off.</p><p>But for the heart, for the center of their health, they do little or nothing. Only when surgery is imminent, they wake up. But by then the problem is already there, often only repair measures are possible. But that is always only the second best variant. After all, most heart diseases could be prevented or at least delayed by a bit of prevention and a reasonably sensible lifestyle.</p><p>"Heart Matters. The astounding achievements of our most important organ - and how we can heal and protect it" by Umes Arunagirinathan</p><h2><strong>Basically, it is relatively simple. There are five health points you should consider for your heart health:</strong></h2><ol><li>good, tasty nutrition</li><li>moderate exercise</li><li>sufficient sleep</li><li>regular health checks</li><li>keep stress at bay</li></ol><p><strong>Plus three matters of the heart points that are particularly important to me and that do the heart a lot of good:</strong></p><ol><li>society</li><li>love</li><li>look at the sky</li></ol><h2><strong>1. Good, tasty nutrition</strong></h2><p>You don't need a sophisticated diet and certainly no pea counting to eat healthily. If you manage to follow a few principles, you are already on the right track.</p><p>Eat as little processed foods as possible. Cook by yourself and use fresh ingredients. Ready meals, packet soups and canned food are mostly highly industrialized products, they often contain inferior fats, too much salt, preservatives and flavor enhancers. Meat and sausage consumption should be reduced and the diet should be as high in fiber and vitamins as possible.</p><p>Often, Mediterranean cuisine is described as particularly heart-healthy. That's true. But we do not live in the Mediterranean, and it is of no use to buy expensive pale tomatoes in the supermarket and artichoke bottoms from a can in winter to cook an Italian recipe. With our local vegetables and fruit, heart-healthy, tasty dishes can also be prepared in every season, usually very cheaply. For example, consumer centers offer many recipes, even for small budgets, for seniors or families with children.</p><h2><strong>2. Moderate exercise</strong></h2><p>The fact that many people are overweight is not or not only due to food, but because they do not exercise. Many of us sit for ten or more hours a day, but eat as if we were always on our feet like in prehistoric times, chasing our prey. We are oversupplied with calories, and one unnecessary pound adds to another. Obesity and adiposity are a scourge of our affluent society. They cause high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart failure, increased risk of cancer and a lot of other unpleasant things.</p><p>The WHO recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five days a week or at least 20 minutes of intense physical activity three days a week. "Moderate physical activity" means light endurance sports, such as swimming, cycling, Nordic walking, jogging, indoor rowing or similar. The nice thing about such activity is that the effect becomes apparent relatively quickly. Probably the pounds won't tumble into the double digits right away, but the heart soon increases its performance and works more efficiently. This also lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels. With just half an hour a day!</p><h2><strong>3. Sufficient sleep</strong></h2><p>I have already described elsewhere that snorers endanger their heart health. But I would like to emphasize again that sleep in general is very important for body and soul. Not everyone needs the same amount of sleep, on average people around forty sleep about seven hours, between the ages of 55 and 60 six and a half hours, <em>healthy</em> 80-year-olds about six hours.</p><p>Sleep is important because we regenerate during this phase, even the cardiovascular system switches to recovery mode. Blood pressure drops by at least 10 percent compared to the average daytime value. The frequency of the heartbeat also decreases, the heart has to pump less. A permanently too short or disturbed sleep causes negative effects among other things on the heart and circulation. The risk of developing high blood pressure and narrowing of the coronary arteries increases. Maybe you have noticed it yourself when you measured your blood pressure after a bad night, possibly with alcohol consumption in the evening. It was probably higher than usual.</p><p>There are a few factors that are important for good sleep, these include:</p><ul><li>regular bedtimes,</li><li>a decent mattress,</li><li>a dark enough bedroom</li><li>and suitable temperature.</li></ul><p>Having a stomach busy with a hard-to-digest meal, alcohol, exciting movies or games before bedtime are unfavorable.</p><p>Prescription sleep aids are only an option if the doctor has diagnosed a sleep disorder. They should only be taken for a relatively short time, as the side effects are strong, and the potential for addiction is high.</p><h2><strong>4. Regular health checks</strong></h2><p>From the age of 35, every insured person in Germany can have a check-up carried out free of charge by their GP or another doctor every three years, once between the ages of 18 and 34. The Federal Ministry of Health lists what happens during a check-up:</p><ul><li>Anamnesis (for example, questions about complaints), in particular the recording of the risk profile (for example, smoking, lack of exercise, overweight, family (cancer) risks), checking the vaccination status</li><li>physical examination (whole body status) including blood pressure measurement</li><li>laboratory examination from the blood (from the age of 35; in 18- to 34-year-olds, a laboratory examination is carried out if there is a corresponding risk profile): lipid profile (for example, cholesterol), glucose; urine laboratory examination (only from the age of 35): protein, glucose, red/white blood cells, nitrite</li><li>Consultation about the examination results and individual risk factors. If medically indicated, possibly issuing a prevention recommendation (for example, courses on movement, nutrition, stress management or substance abuse)</li><li>As part of the check-up, there is also a one-time claim to screening for a hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection (from the age of 35)</li></ul><p>Like almost all health measures, these checkups are voluntary. That's good, but maybe there lies the problem. I find the participation numbers disappointing, to say the least, shattering. I emphasize once again: no repair measure in the world can restore the state of a heart (or any other organ) as if it had been treated carefully all its life.</p><p><strong>5. Keeping stress at bay</strong></p><p>I have already written about stress in various publications. Basically, stress is nothing bad, but part of our crisis management strategy. A system is temporarily ramped up that mobilizes forces and reactions with which we can withstand a threatening situation.</p><p>But when there is permanent alarm, the system reaches its limits. That's why it's very important to develop a method to "come down" instead of staying at the high level of stress. A first step is to recognize whether you react more to internal stress triggers or to external stressors. Internal ones would be, for example, a strongly developed perfectionism and too high expectations of oneself and one's environment.</p><p>An important rule of stress management also is to change your relation to a situation that stresses you out. That meas, how important is it really for me to finish this task on time? Is it decisive? Can I explain plausibly to the client why a delay is occurring? etc.</p><p>This works in many cases, you can turn this or that screw or get rid of situations that always cause stress. Sometimes, however, it doesn't. Apparently, more and more people feel that they are constantly experiencing stress and are overwhelmed. Women also react more sensitively to stress than men, especially to psychosocial stress.</p><p>The permanent chronic stress of a body in stress affects the heart, that's for sure. Health insurance providers, companies, further education providers and other institutions offer a huge repertoire of analogue or digital courses and activities that can help to learn to deal with stress better. Yoga courses, progressive muscle training, stress management, time management, self-perception and much more - these are good impulses and approaches that can help to break out of the entrenched, seemingly cemented tracks and to mitigate the experience of distress and helplessness.</p><h2><strong>These are my three matters of the heart</strong></h2><p>Perhaps you are wondering why such "vague" recommendations as society, love and sky-gazing appear in a medical guide to cardiac health. But actually, it's obvious. Health, especially that of the heart, is not a purely organic affair. The soul always plays along, sometimes quite heavily, as we can see, for example, in the phenomenon of Takotsubo, the broken heart syndrome. Therefore, you should not only pay attention to blood pressure and the like, but also ensure that the soul gets what it needs.</p><h2><strong>1. Society</strong></h2><p>"Man is a social being," this is how the relationship between the individual and society can be described quite soberly. But what does that mean? That we can't be alone? Yes, because without other people none of us could survive. The feeling of loneliness is, evolutionarily seen, the warning feeling for a human being that it becomes dangerous for him or her without group affiliation.</p><p>Being alone is bad. We are designed to have an opposite. The soul wants to be vibrated, and we usually only manage that by opening up to others and also being open to them. Being alone or lonely - that's not the same thing. There are many people who get along very well with themselves and limit their contacts to the bare minimum.</p><p>But tens of thousands of people are lonely, that is, without wanting to, they have no or no satisfactory relationships. The reasons are different. That's dangerous, also for physical health.</p><p>You do not have all the "ingredients" for a sociable life in your hand. But many do. One is prevention. Do not allow yourself to remain without encounters or contact for days on end. Once you're in the loneliness spiral, it gets difficult. Step out of your apartment. If you don't know anyone you could go to, attend an event, whether a concert or a reading in the city library. Many things are even offered for free. The main thing is, you see other people. And gather your courage, speak to your seat neighbor during the break and talk for a minute or two. Or longer if it fits.</p><p>My appeal as a heart surgeon: get your heart friends so it doesn't get sick. Just ring your neighbors' doorbell.</p><h2><strong>2. Love</strong></h2><p>The total opposite of loneliness is love. Love that one receives, and love that one gives. An absurd hint? It may sound a bit like that, but I am very serious. How to find a man or woman for life (or for a part of it) is not the point here. You can't just set that up to reduce the risk of heart disease. But it is possible to turn to the world with a little love. To reconcile with what plagues you.</p><p>By the way, it also does your own heart good when you give love and do something good for others. To stand up for others. Of course, this must not lead to stress. But sometimes it just feels good to help other people. To support them in their development. Volunteering is ideal for this. There are endless possibilities to get involved. You will surely find a good cause that meets your inclinations and desires.</p><p>Volunteering also distracts a bit from yourself. It puts you, for example, in a different relation to your pain and worries. Because you have contact with other people than just the doctors and therapists to whom you tell your problems and from whom you expect help. In a volunteer job, you meet people you can help. This is a very good, satisfying experience. Someone needs you. You are a valuable person to another.</p><h2><strong>3. Look at the sky</strong></h2><p>My mother lives in Sri Lanka in a small village. Only a few streets from her house is the temple of the goddess Kannarai Amman, the wife of Shiva. She encompasses three beings: the goddess of knowledge, the goddess of wealth and the goddess of strength. My mother goes there regularly, not every day, but several times a week. She prays and talks to the goddess, she lays her worries before her. She does not need to be ashamed before her and can also express what she suppresses, but which always breaks through again. She relieves her heart. I am a spiritual person and would like to advise you: go to the church, the mosque, the synagogue, the temple or another house of God from time to time. But such advice could be considered overbearing. But what I can do: I recommend you to raise your gaze from time to time, away from the earth, away from what drags you down and binds you.</p><p>Look up and enjoy the wonderful blue of the sky, curious cloud images or the charm of a cool gray. Maybe while doing so, you will also see a piece of the great creation of which you are a part. A small, but important one. This realization makes your heart happy, for sure.</p></main>
