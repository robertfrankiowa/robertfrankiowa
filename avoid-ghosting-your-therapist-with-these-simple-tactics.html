Provided by 21 Ninety</em></figcaption></figure><p> <p>The increased incidents of depression and anxiety have led to more people seeking therapists for their mental health.</p><p>The uptick in mental health treatment can be traced back to the pandemic in 2020 and the uncertainties surrounding the state of the world. With the shutdown due to COVID-19 and police brutality protests following the murder of George Floyd and other Black individuals, it makes sense that people began prioritizing their mental health. </p><p>Four years later, depression, anxiety and the daily stressors of life remain prominent. Therapy continues to be a booming industry. In times of distress, therapists can provide a safe space for clients to release their fears and worries to someone trained to address their concerns. Therapists serve as a neutral listening ear and are committed to developing coping mechanisms that help change unwanted behaviors or patterns.</p><p>As there is a high demand for mental health professionals, finding the right match becomes more challenging. Like dating, finding a therapist is a trial-and-error process that could take only a few days or weeks. While opening up to different people frequently may be laboring, ghosting a therapist may not be the best solution on a healing journey. </p><p>Instead of cutting off complete communication, consider facing the issue head-on.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand Their Communication Style Beforehand </h2><p>Participating in an initial consultation before scheduling an appointment helps gauge whether that therapist is the one to commit to. An initial consultation can be held over the phone or through Zoom. It also assesses how potential sessions would happen. This conversation is the time to ask questions about their approaches to certain situations. </p><p>It also provides a better understanding of how they work with patients and helps determine whether the pairing fits for both ends well. Throughout the talk, a person can test their comfort levels with the therapist and get a feel for how things operate. The biggest benefit of a consultation is that afterward, there is clarity on whether to progress or move on.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Speak Up If Something Isn’t Working For You</h2><p>It’s important to remember that therapists are there to be a helpful resource for their patients. Therapy is supposed to be a safe space where clients feel comfortable and empowered to speak up when they don’t agree with something. </p><p>An open line of communication is essential to properly receiving the help needed. By voicing concerns or dislikes, therapists can tailor their methods or strategies to serve their patients best. Ultimately, it works out for the client because the therapist can adjust their actions.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have The Honest, Awkward Breakup Conversation</h2><p>If a few sessions have passed and it doesn’t seem like the right decision, it’s natural to feel as if ghosting future sessions is the only option. While avoiding the awkward and uncomfortable breakup conversation offers temporary relief at the moment, it could delay a person’s progress. </p><p>Having an open conversation about not wanting to move forward is a healthy way of handling the situation. Providing constructive feedback can set a person up for long-term success when trying to find a new therapist. If a face-to-face talk feels intimidating, consider emailing or messaging them instead. A proper closing is always better.</p>
