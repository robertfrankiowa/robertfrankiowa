    <main><h1>8 Signs of Poor Liver Health & the Best Supplements to Help Support It</h1><p class="has-small-font-size"><em>This site contains product affiliate links. We may receive a commission if you make a purchase after clicking on one of these links.</em></p><p>The liver plays a crucial role in the body, serving as a multifunctional organ with several important tasks. It acts as a filter for the blood, removing harmful substances such as alcohol and drugs. Additionally, the liver produces bile, a vital fluid that aids in the digestion of fats and transports waste products. Moreover, the liver regulates various chemical levels in the blood and secures bile to eliminate waste products. It is worth noting that all blood from the stomach and intestines passes through the liver, highlighting its significance in maintaining overall health.</p><p>The liver is a crucial storage site for fat-soluble vitamins and is responsible for maintaining cholesterol balance. Additionally, it effectively stores iron and copper. The liver also performs essential functions in the blood clotting process and contributes to the synthesis of proteins (Kalra et al., 2024). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Did You Know the Liver can Regenerate itself? </strong></h2><p>The liver is an incredible organ that can regenerate even after significant damage. It can regrow to its standard size even if up to 90% of it has been removed. However, while the liver is resilient, it is not invincible. Various factors, including cancer, hepatitis, certain medication overdoses, and fatty liver disease, can harm it beyond the point of repair (Gilgenkrantz & Collin de l’Hortet, 2018).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eight Signs of Poor Liver Health </strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1oHhFV_human_liver_disease_diagnosis_and_liver_treatment_doctor_showing_liver_anatomical_model_for_treatment_hep.jpg" alt="Human liver disease, diagnosis and liver treatment.

Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>Understanding the indicators of a healthy liver and embracing habits that promote liver health is crucial for taking proactive measures to safeguard this vital organ. It’s important to remember that seeking prompt medical advice at the first indication of any issues is essential for early detection and treatment of liver-related concerns. Prioritizing the well-being of your liver will result in a more vibrant and energetic life.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Jaundice</strong></h3><p>Jaundice is a medical condition characterized by the yellow discoloration of body tissues, particularly the skin and the whites of the eyes. This occurs due to the blood’s build-up of a substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment produced when red blood cells break down. When an adult becomes jaundiced, it can indicate an underlying health issue that needs attention. Jaundice is commonly associated with liver disease, as it often results from a disruption in the balance between the production and clearance of bilirubin. In liver damage or dysfunction cases, the liver cells may be unable to process and excrete this substance effectively, causing an accumulation in the body and subsequent yellowing of tissues (Ravindran, 2020). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Pale Stool </strong></h3><p>The brown colour of your stool is due to the release of bile salts from your liver. If your liver isn’t producing an adequate amount of bile, or if the flow of bile is blocked, disrupting the draining process from your liver, your stools may appear pale or clay-coloured (Bergasa & Tasuku, 2014).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Dark Urine </strong></h3><p>Approximately 25% of individuals with liver cirrhosis experience a symptom known as palmar erythema, which causes the palms of the hands to appear red. Additionally, dark urine that appears dark orange, amber, cola-coloured, or brown can indicate liver disease. This change in urine colour occurs due to elevated bilirubin levels when the liver cannot properly break it down. Even if adequately hydrated, persistently dark-coloured urine might be an early sign of liver dysfunction. The urine may present as brown, amber, or orange due to the accumulation of bilirubin (Braga Neto et al., 2022).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</strong></h3><p>An increased occurrence of restless leg syndrome (RLS) has been identified in patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, particularly in the United States and Japan. Among individuals with chronic liver disease, restlessness is commonly experienced as RLS. As liver damage progresses, more severe symptoms may manifest, including edema (fluid retention causing swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet) and ascites (abdominal swelling caused by fluid accumulation) (Franco et al., 2008).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Bruising Easily </strong></h3><p>Liver damage can reduce the body’s production of proteins essential for blood clotting. As a result, individuals may experience increased susceptibility to bleeding and bruising (Sugiyama et al., 2009).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Itchy skin</strong></h3><p>Pruritus, commonly known as itching, is a well-recognized and common symptom of cholestatic liver disease. This type of itching tends to intensify during the late evening and at night, leading to significant distress for individuals affected. It can manifest as localized itching in specific areas such as the limbs, feet’ soles, or hands’ palms or as a pervasive, whole-body itch (Hegade et al., 2015).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Nausea or vomiting</strong></h3><p>Early signs of liver disease, often starting with nausea and an upset stomach, should not be taken lightly. As the liver’s ability to rid the body of toxins diminishes, these digestive issues can worsen. The persistence of nausea, a result of an excess buildup of waste products in the body, and unexplained vomiting, frequently associated with liver-related issues, should raise a sense of concern and prompt immediate attention (Wang et al., 2018).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Loss of Appetite</strong></h3><p>Individuals may commonly experience a reduced desire to eat as the liver’s function declines (Chapman et al., 2020). Specifically, research indicates that 36% of patients with cirrhosis reported decreased appetite (Ishizu et al., 2022).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Diet and Lifestyle to Support a Healthy Liver</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1oHkdT_liver_anatomical_model_on_doctors_table_during_hepatologist_consultation_for_patient_with_side_pain_in_ba.jpg" alt="Liver anatomical model on doctor's table during hepatologist consultation for patient with side pain in background. Treatment liver diseases in medicine, conceptual image"><figcaption><em>Sources: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease globally. In 2017, it was prevalent in 20–30% of the adult population (Ekstedt et al., 2017), and by 2022, the overall prevalence had risen to 32.4%. The increase in prevalence is a global trend (Riazi et al., 2022). Consuming a low to moderate fat and moderate to high carbohydrate diet is essential to managing or reducing liver fat. Also, limiting carbohydrate intake and avoiding fructose-containing foods and beverages would be best. Keeping alcohol intake below the risk threshold is also advisable (Montemayor et al., 2023). Studies have confirmed that consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grain cereals, fatty fish (which are high in omega 3), and cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil may be effective in preventing and stopping the advancement of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Berná & Romero‐Gomez, 2020).When aiming for a healthy lifestyle that supports liver health, it’s essential to consider oxidative stress management a significant component (Uchida et al., 2020). Many individuals tend to turn to unhealthy food choices, which can place additional strain on the liver during periods of stress. Prioritizing good nutrition can help reduce the overall stress experienced by the body. Moreover, exercise plays a pivotal role in fortifying liver health. Scientific studies have shown that a blend of aerobic and weight training is advantageous. Aerobic exercise can bolster the cardiovascular system, improving blood flow to the liver.</p><p>Conversely, weight training can aid in increasing lean body mass and boosting metabolism, thereby preventing excess fat buildup in the liver. Exercise also triggers the release of anti-inflammatory agents in the body, which can help maintain optimal liver function (Hannah & Harrison, 2016). It’s essential to set realistic goals, especially for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions. A sensible approach is to begin with three 20-minute workout sessions weekly and gradually increase the frequency to five days or more (Fernández et al., 2022) (“Easl–easd–easo Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,” 2016).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Natural Liver Support Supplements </strong></h2><p>Many products today claiming to detoxify the liver are also marketed as weight-loss cleanses, but no scientific evidence supports their effectiveness. Some dietary supplements can even harm the liver and should be used cautiously as they may cause drug-induced injury. Johns Hopkins hepatologists advise against using these products, emphasizing that the FDA does not regulate them and lacks adequate testing in clinical trials, as explained by Dr. Woreta (Woreta, n.d.). It’s important to note that liver detoxes are not essential for maintaining good liver function or overall health. There is no evidence supporting the idea that they can eliminate toxins after indulging in excessive unhealthy food or alcohol consumption. The liver has a limited volume to process alcohol, and excessive drinking can put a strain on its functioning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Therapeutic Supplement for the Liver </strong></h2><p>While scientific research suggests that certain supplements may be beneficial for liver health, particularly in cases of liver disease, there is little evidence supporting their use in individuals with healthy livers. I recommend consulting a healthcare professional before implementing a natural supplement for liver health. I have identified four supplements that have demonstrated positive effects on liver function. However, further research is required in certain instances.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Zinc</strong></h3><p>Zinc is crucial in various zinc enzymes essential for maintaining liver function. Since the 1950s, medical professionals have acknowledged that individuals with cirrhosis caused by different factors often have insufficient levels of zinc (Vallee et al., 1956). There is widespread recognition that individuals with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) commonly experience zinc deficiency as well (McClain et al., 1986). </p><p><strong>Product: NOW Zinc Glycinate 30mg</strong></p><p>Zinc is a crucial mineral co-factor in hundreds of enzymatic reactions within the body. These reactions involve essential processes such as protein and carbohydrate metabolism, RNA/DNA synthesis, and intercellular signalling. This essential mineral plays a vital role in supporting the normal function of numerous organs and systems in the body. Maintaining a healthy immune system, liver function, skeletal structure, neurological function, and endocrine system is essential.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Silymarin (Milk Thistle)</strong></h3><p>One of the primary active ingredients found in milk thistle is silymarin, extracted from the seeds of the Silybium marianum plant, also known as milk thistle. Silymarin, a member of the daisy family, is believed to possess antioxidant properties (Luper, 1998). These supplements are commonly used to support and promote liver health and to address multiple liver conditions (Schümann et al., 2003).</p><p><strong>Product: A.Vogel Milk Thistle – Liver Pain and Liver Disorders</strong></p><p>They are traditionally used to treat liver, spleen, and gallbladder disorders, including hepatic, splenic, or renal congestion, gallstones, hepatic pain, and swelling. It is a liver tonic that promotes liver health and treats symptoms caused by liver pain. It also treats disorders and congestion of the liver, spleen, gallbladder, gallstones, liver pain, and swelling. It is made from milk thistle fruit.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe)</strong></h3><p>SAMe plays a role in the immune system, and research indicates that it can potentially restore liver enzyme levels in individuals diagnosed with liver disease. SAMe also demonstrates its leading role in liver regeneration, and in mammals, SAMe studies show its ability to shield against liver damage and even reverse it (Lu et al., 2000). The National Institute of Health (NIH) states that more ongoing human research studies are needed.</p><p><strong>Product: Pure Encapsulations SAMe 200mg</strong></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Vitamin E </strong></h3><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1oHaJk_beauty_supplement_closeup_of_smiling_black_woman_taking_vitamin_pill_capsule_having_diet_nutrition_croppe.jpg" alt="Beauty Supplement. Closeup Of Smiling Black Woman Taking Vitamin Pill Capsule, Having Diet Nutrition, Cropped Image"><figcaption><em>Sources: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>In animal models of ethanol-induced liver disease, the administration of vitamin E has demonstrated improvements in liver histology and a reduction in CYP 2E1 activity. However, research involving human subjects has yet to yield conclusive evidence supporting the effectiveness of vitamin E in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Nevertheless, a limited number of small-scale studies involving patients with chronic hepatitis C have shown therapeutic benefits associated with vitamin E treatment.</p><p><strong>Product: Natural Factors Mixed Vitamin E</strong></p><p>Vitamin E is primarily known for its powerful antioxidant benefits. It helps to protect cell membranes against damage caused by free radicals and prevents the oxidation of LDL ("bad") cholesterol. Vitamin E is also necessary for the structural and functional maintenance of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Four Supplements You Should Avoid for Liver Health </strong></h2><p>Certain popular health supplements, such as Gota Kola, Kava, black cohosh and saw palmetto, contain restricted components that can harm the liver. You should avoid those supplements if you have liver dysfunction.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Gota Kola</strong></h3><p>The Gotu kola supplement is commonly used to treat varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency, characterized by blood pooling in the legs. However, it is essential to note that the use of gotu kola may lead to liver damage. As a result, individuals with existing liver disease should refrain from using gotu kola. This herb has the potential to be detrimental to the liver, so individuals with liver disease or those medications that impact liver function should avoid the use of gotu kola (Choi et al., 2016).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Kava Kava</strong></h3><p>Kava is a natural remedy that improves mood, well-being, and relaxation. Research suggests that kava may help treat anxiety, insomnia, and nervous disorders. However, it’s essential to know that using kava could pose risks to liver health. Some people have experienced severe liver damage or failure after taking kava. It’s critical to only use kava under the close supervision of a doctor. If you have liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, you should not use kava at all (“Kava Hepatotoxicity: Are We Any Closer to the Truth?,” 2004) (Anke et al., 2006).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Saw Palmetto</strong></h3><p>Saw palmetto is often promoted as a dietary supplement for urinary symptoms related to an enlarged prostate gland or BPH. It’s important to note that preparations of saw palmetto have been associated with cholestatic hepatitis in some patients. There have been two reports of liver damage in men who took saw palmetto. However, it’s not clear if saw palmetto was the direct cause of these effects. It’s crucial not to self-treat BPH with saw palmetto. Instead, it’s essential to see your doctor for a proper diagnosis (Jibrin et al., 2006) (Lapi et al., 2010).</p><p>Black cohosh is a North American herb whose root is used for various estrogen-related conditions. It is commonly used for menopausal symptoms, PMS, painful menstruation, and weak bones. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support these uses. There have been reports of black cohosh possibly causing liver damage in some individuals, but the frequency of this occurrence is not well understood. As a precaution, individuals with liver disease should refrain from using black cohosh until further research provides more clarity on this potential risk (Muqeet Adnan et al., 2014).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take Away</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1oH3Zc_the_important_substances_found_in_lecithin_are_phosphatidylcholine_phosphatidylcholine_is_an_important_co.jpg" alt="The important substances found in lecithin are phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is an important component of liver cells. Has antioxidant activity. Help prevent alcohol, chemicals."><figcaption><em>Sources: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>Your liver is a vital organ crucial to the body’s function. It receives blood from the digestive organs, processes and detoxifies it, and produces essential nutrients. Additionally, it metabolizes medications, converting them into forms that are either beneficial for the body or harmless. The liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate following dysfunction, dysregulation or injury. It can fully regrow even after undergoing up to 90% removal. However, despite its regenerative capacity, the liver is still vulnerable to damage from various diseases and harmful exposures, which may exceed its ability to repair itself. While it’s essential to engage in liver detox programs or take supplements to address liver damage, it’s crucial to be aware that some detox ingredients could potentially harm your liver. Studies have shown an increase in liver injuries from herbal and dietary supplements. For instance, Kava Kava, Saw palmetto, and Gota kola have been linked to liver damage. However, evidence-based supplements that could promote liver health, such as zinc, milk thistle, vitamin E, and SAMe, have demonstrated some positive effects, but further research is needed. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and ensuring essential nutrients in your diet might help prevent liver issues.</p></main>
