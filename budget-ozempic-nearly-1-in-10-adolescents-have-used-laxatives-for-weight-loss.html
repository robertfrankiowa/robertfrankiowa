    <main><h1>'Budget Ozempic'? Nearly 1 in 10 Adolescents Have Used Laxatives for Weight Loss</h1><p>     <strong>Fact checked by Nick Blackmer</strong> </p><p><ul><li>New research found that nearly 10% of adolescents worldwide have used non-prescribed weight loss products, like laxatives.</li><li>Using laxatives for weight loss can result in malnutrition, which can lead to other health consequences.</li><li>Experts recommend consulting a trusted healthcare provider if you’re concerned about how to lose weight in a safe, healthy manner.</li></ul><p> <p>No, using laxatives to lose weight is not a medically approved idea.</p><p>More people are turning to laxatives to shed pounds, but experts agree the over-the-counter drug is not effective or safe to be used as a weight loss product and can have negative effects if taken for the incorrect reason.</p><p>A new study, published earlier this month in <em>JAMA Open Network</em>, found that almost 1 in 10 adolescents worldwide have used non-prescribed weight loss products, like laxatives.</p><p>The use of weight loss products happens “at high levels in adolescents, especially girls,” and can have long-term health consequences, researchers concluded.</p><p>“Use of nonprescribed weight loss products in adolescents is a public health concern that is associated with negative physical and psychological consequences,” Natasha Hall, PhD, a lead author of the study, told <em>Health</em>.  </p><p>The meta-analysis included 90 studies, with 604,552 participants under the age of 18. Researchers found diet pills were the most commonly used weight loss drug, and laxatives and diuretics were the next most popular.</p><p>Researchers also found that weight-loss products were used most frequently in North America compared to Asia and Europe, and 2 percent of the participants reported having used a weight-loss product in the last week.</p><p>“We hope this study promotes awareness of how important this issue is and provides information on just how many adolescents are engaging in these harmful activities that do not work and are actually linked to some serious long-term risks,” Hall said. </p><p>Here’s what happens when laxatives are used for weight loss, as well as doctor-recommended alternatives.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1hyO3d_girl_sitting_on_toilet.jpg" alt="Girl sitting on toilet"><figcaption><em>Getty Images / Westend61.

It can lead to weakened bones and muscles, poor mentation, lower school performance, and can even lead to eating disorders in the long term.”</p><p>Mathis added that someone may experience abnormal weight gain after stopping taking laxatives, which can create a vicious cycle of weight gain and loss. This cycle can cause several health complications.</p><p><p>There are four main types of laxatives that individuals use:</p><ol><li><strong>Osmotic laxatives</strong>: Draw water from the rest of the body into the stool, which softens stool and makes for easier and more frequent bowel movements. These types of laxatives are most commonly used for children who suffer from constipation. </li><li><strong>Stimulant laxatives</strong>: Stimulate the muscles that line the gut, which helps move stool out of the body. </li><li><strong>Bulk-forming laxatives</strong>: Increase the “bulk” or weight of stool, which helps to stimulate the bowels and move stool out of the body. </li><li><strong>Stool softening laxatives</strong>: Let water into the stool, which softens it and makes it easier to exit the body. </li></ol><h2>A Rise in DIY Weight Loss and ‘Budget Ozempic’</h2><p>Weight loss is one of the many health-related quick fixes that are prevalent on social media.</p><p>Laxatives pose the option of a cheaper, more accessible option for anyone who can't get their hands on a prescription of type 2 diabetes drugs—like Ozempic—that have risen in popularity within the weight loss space.</p><p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported in September 2023 that laxatives have become the “budget Ozempic.”</p><p>While this may be the case for people of all ages, it is particularly dangerous to younger people.</p><p>“People often don’t realize how aggressively over-the-counter diet pills and weight-loss supplements are promoted to teens on social media,” said Hall.</p><p>Influencers on TikTok are using hashtags like #guttok, which has garnered over 1.2 billion views, suggesting that laxatives and stool softeners like Miralax, Glycolax, and Ex-Lax can help you lose weight.</p><p>Many of the same influencers are also pushing weight-loss supplements and diet pills that are unregulated, which Hall explained can be a slippery slope.</p><p>“But the products they are hawking don’t work and are dangerous,” said Hall. “Better regulations surrounding social media advertising to minors is also required.”</p><h2>What Doctors Recommend for Safe Weight Loss</h2><p>The answer is clear: Doctors agree that laxatives should never be used for weight loss purposes. Instead, a balanced lifestyle is key to maintaining a healthy and appropriate weight.</p><p>Mathis recommends focusing on food choices by eating real food, trying to adhere to 2,000 calories or less each day, and making vegetables and fruits a primary source of nutrition.</p><p>Other options include foods that act as natural laxatives: fiber-rich breads, nuts and seeds, probiotic yogurts and cheese, and even fatty fish. </p><p>“The second thing that helps maintain a healthy weight is to get regular physical activity through either exercise or daily actions that promote health like gardening, sports, walking, or taking the stairs at work,” Mathis said.</p>
