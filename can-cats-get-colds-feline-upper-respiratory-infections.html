Feline Upper Respiratory Infections</h1><figure><img title="iStock/Getty Images Plus" src="IMG/AA1iIDCs_cat_with_cold_on_couch.jpg" alt="cat with cold on couch"><figcaption><em>If you cat has a cold, give them a quiet, comfortable place to recover.. iStock/Getty Images Plus</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, cats can get colds. These upper respiratory infections (URIs) are harmless most of the time, but a trip to the vet can give you peace of mind, rule out other potential causes and make your cat more comfortable.</p><p>Learn the signs and symptoms to look for in your feline, how cats catch colds and what to do if your companion comes down with the sniffles.</p><h2>Cat Cold Symptoms</h2><p><em>Newsweek</em> spoke with Dr. Bruce Kornreich, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) and director of Cornell University's Feline Health Center, about cat colds. He says these symptoms are common in cats with URIs:</p><ul> <li>Sneezing</li> <li>Nasal and ocular discharge</li> <li>Coughing</li> <li>Lethargy</li> <li>Decreased appetite</li> </ul><h2>How Vets Diagnose Cat Colds</h2><p>If your cat shows symptoms of a URI, you can schedule a vet visit to get an official diagnosis.</p><p>Your vet will perform an exam on your cat. They may:</p><ul> <li>Take a chest X-ray to find signs of pneumonia, asthma or fungal infection</li> <li>Perform blood tests to make sure your cat's internal organs are working properly</li> <li>Take samples of the discharge from your cat's nose and eyes to test for viruses that cause feline colds</li> </ul><p>These tests can determine the proper treatment for your cat. They can also rule out other causes for these symptoms, like allergies.</p><h2>Cat Colds vs. Allergies</h2><p>"Inhalant allergies and viral upper respiratory infections in cats share some common symptoms," Kornreich said. Knowing the difference can help you find out what's going on with your cat and what you can do to help them.</p><p>"Allergies are often seasonal and recurrent at specific times of year," Kornreich said. Common triggers include pollen during the spring and dust mites stirred up in HVAC ducts during the winter.</p><p>Allergies can also show slightly different symptoms than colds:</p><ul> <li>Clear nasal discharge, instead of greenish yellow</li> <li>Patches of hair loss</li> <li>Chewing their skin, like how dogs lick and chew their paws</li> <li>Digestive problems, like diarrhea or vomiting</li> </ul><p>If your cat has seasonal allergies, you can try limiting their exposure to the allergens or giving them an antihistamine like Benadryl. The Merck Veterinary Manual recommends 0.9 to 1.8 milligrams per pound of your cat's weight. So a 10-pound cat should start at 9 mg per day, with a maximum dosage of 18 mg per day.</p><p>Talk to a vet if your cat's allergies become serious or persist past their usual season.</p><h2>How Do Cats Catch Colds?</h2><p>Cats transmit colds to one another when an infected cat sneezes or licks another animal.</p><p>Outdoor cats can pick up colds when socializing with other felines. Indoor cats are especially prone to catching colds from highly populated environments with poor circulation, like shelters or cat hotels.</p><p>Humans cannot become infected from the viruses that cause cat colds. But we can pick them up on our hands and transmit them to cats. So if you've been out fraternizing with other felines, make sure to wash your hands before cuddling your cat at home.</p><h2>Common Causes of Cat Colds</h2><p>Most cat colds are because of two common viruses:</p><h3>Feline Herpesvirus</h3><p>Like the herpes virus in humans, cats with feline herpesvirus carry it throughout their lives. However, most of the time the virus is dormant, so your cat won't show symptoms.</p><p>Stressful events, like moving or taking your cat for grooming, can trigger the virus and give your cat a cold.</p><p>If you have an indoor cat that rarely sees other cats, but has a cold, they may have picked up a feline herpesvirus infection long ago that's just now showing symptoms.</p><h3>Feline Calicivirus</h3><p>If your cat catches feline calicivirus, the virus may incubate for several days before becoming active and causing the symptoms of a feline cold. During this time, they're highly contagious to other cats.</p><p>Similar to feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus can stay in your cat's system after the symptoms pass, turning them into an otherwise healthy carrier. However, this only happens in about half of all infected cats.</p><h2>Cat Upper Respiratory Infection Treatment</h2><p>Most cat colds clear up within one to two weeks. Kornreich has several recommendations you can do at home to keep your cat healthy and comfortable:</p><ul> <li><strong>Provide a comfortable, low-stress area </strong>for resting</li> <li><strong>Keep their nose and eyes clean</strong> by wiping with a cotton ball dipped in warm water</li> <li><strong>Set up a humidifier</strong> to help with breathing</li> <li><strong>Make feeding easier</strong> by slightly warming your cat's food in the microwave and offering canned options</li> </ul><h2>When To See the Vet for Cat Colds</h2><p>"Any cat that demonstrates the signs of either allergies or upper respiratory infections should be seen by a veterinarian," Kornreich said.</p><p>Vets may prescribe medication to mitigate the symptoms of your cat's cold. They can also rule out more serious illnesses.</p><p>Kornreich recommends having your cat reevaluated by a vet if they:</p><ul> <li>Stop eating for more than a day</li> <li>Become more lethargic</li> <li>Have difficulty breathing</li> <li>Paw at their eyes</li> <li>Show repeated episodes of diarrhea or vomiting</li> </ul><h2>How To Prevent Cat Colds</h2><p>There are several things you can do to prevent or mitigate colds in your cat:</p><ul> <li><strong>Get them vaccinated.</strong> Ask your vet about the RCP vaccination, which boosts immunity to feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus.</li> <li><strong>Avoid infected cats.</strong> Don't take your cat to places where cats showing cold symptoms are present.</li> <li><strong>Socialize in well-ventilated environments.</strong> Let your cat meet other cats outdoors or in well-ventilated rooms.</li> <li><strong>Wash your hands.</strong> Humans can spread cat colds without even realizing it. Wash your hands after playing with other cats, even if they don't show symptoms.</li> </ul><h2>Cat Cold FAQs</h2><p>If you have a question not covered here, talk to your vet to learn more about upper respiratory infections in cats.</p><h3>How Long Do Cat Colds Last?</h3><p>Most cats show cold symptoms for one to two weeks. However, every cat experiences colds differently, and your cat may continue showing signs after two weeks.</p><p>Consult with your vet if you're concerned about how long your cat has had a cold.</p><h3>Can Cats Die from Upper Respiratory Infections?</h3><p>It is very rare that cats die from an upper respiratory infection.</p><p>When it does happen, it's usually in conjunction with other factors, like old age. Biannual wellness checks can help senior cats stay in good health, so they're at less risk of developing serious symptoms from a cold.</p><p>Indoor cats are most prone to catching colds in crowded, poorly ventilated environments like shelters. However, they can also pick up cold-causing viruses from their humans who have been visiting other cats.</p><p>Start your unlimited Newsweek trial</p></main>
