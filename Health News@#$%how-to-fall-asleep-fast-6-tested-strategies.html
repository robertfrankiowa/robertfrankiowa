You can also use white noise instead of music.</p><h3>The Military Sleep Method</h3><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Due to stress, conditions, and the nature of their jobs, military members often struggle to fall asleep. Overall, military members have higher rates of sleep deprivation than the general population.</p><p> <p>The military sleep method has been used for decades to help service members fall asleep within two minutes. The steps of the military sleep method are:</p><ol><li>Start by relaxing the entire face, including the forehead, eyes, and jaw</li><li>Drop your shoulders, then hands, letting them fall to the sides of your body</li><li>Inhale and exhale to relax your chest, then work your way down the body, relaxing your thighs, calves, ankles, and feet</li><li>Clear your mind for 10 seconds by visualizing a relaxing scene, letting any thoughts come and go. Once your body is relaxed and your mind is clear, you should be able to sleep.</li></ol><h3>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h3><p>Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups one at a time, starting with the toes and feet and working up to the eyes and forehead. Steps include:</p><ol><li>Breathe in and tense your first group of muscles</li><li>Hold the tension for 5 to 10 seconds.</li><li>Breathe out and relax the muscles in the group</li><li>Pause for 10-20 seconds before going on to the next muscle group</li></ol><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Research has shown that progressive muscle relaxation is effective in enhancing relaxation, reducing stress, and improving overall well-being.</p><p> <h3>Guided Imagery</h3><p>Research has shown that guided imagery can reduce stress and improve relaxation.

Although there are several different types of breathing exercises for sleep, they typically involve taking long, deep, controlled breaths.</p><h2>How Long Should It Take to Fall Asleep?</h2><p>How long it takes to fall asleep is known as "sleep latency." Typical sleep latency is 10 to 20 minutes from lying down to falling asleep, although this can vary among individuals.</p><p><p>The 10-3-2-1-0 pre-sleep routine helps signal your body that it's time to relax and unwind for the night.
