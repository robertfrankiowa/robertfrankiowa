    <main><h1>The 10 states with the best health care in America—and the 10 with the worst, based on data</h1><h2>The 10 states with the best health care</h2><p>The states with the best health care in the United States are those where people are generally healthier, have access to health care services and are less likely to be uninsured. The best states for health care are found all across the country, from Hawaii to Rhode Island. That said, 4 of the top 10 states on our list are located in the Northeast.</p><figure><img title="The 10 states with the best health care" src="IMG/BB1j74F1_the_10_states_with_the_best_health_care.jpg" alt="The 10 states with the best health care"><figcaption><em>The 10 states with the best health care. MoneyGeek</em></figcaption></figure><h2>The 10 states with the lowest rank for health care</h2><p>States that fare worse on our health care rankings tend to have higher costs for less access and higher rates of medical conditions like diabetes and obesity. The worst states for health care are concentrated regionally, with 8 of the 10 clustered in the South and Southeast.</p><figure><img title="The 10 states with the lowest rank for health care" src="IMG/BB1j7ef8_the_10_states_with_the_lowest_rank_for_health_care.jpg" alt="The 10 states with the lowest rank for health care"><figcaption><em>The 10 states with the lowest rank for health care.

Those categories include:</p><ul>  <li>Health outcomes, including indicators such as rates of disease and risk factors like obesity and smoking, preventable deaths and infant mortality. These measures help answer the question: How healthy are the people who live here?</li>  <li>Cost, including factors like how much the state spends on health care and the average cost of private health insurance. These measures help answer the question: How expensive is health care in this state?</li>  <li>Access, including data on the number of primary care providers and hospital beds available, how many people are uninsured and how many people needed care but had difficulty getting it. These indicators help answer the question: How easy is it to get the health care you need in this state?</li> </ul><p>Within these three categories, we broke down the best and the worst states across a wide range of health care outcome, cost and access data points. Below is a brief summary of those findings, along with the top best and worst states for each data point.</p><h3><strong>Deep Blue States Across the US Have the Healthiest Residents</strong></h3><ul>  <li><strong>Best States for Health Outcomes:</strong></li> </ul><p>1.

We assigned weights to each factor within these core categories to measure health care quality. </p><p>Outcome Factor Rank: Based on cumulative scores across the following factors:</p><ul>  <li>Infant mortality rate: The number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births</li>  <li>Preventable death rate: Deaths that can be avoided through effective preventative health care and interventions per 100,000 residents</li>  <li>Diabetes mortality rate: Deaths attributed to diabetes per 100,000 residents</li>  <li>Obesity: Percentage of population considered obese</li>  <li>Smoking rate: Percentage of adults who reported smoking</li>  <li>Life expectancy: The average number of years a person can expect to live</li>  <li>Suicide rates: Suicide deaths among persons age 12 and over per 100,000 residents</li>  <li>New HIV cases per 100,000 residents over the age of 13</li>  <li>Opioid-related hospital stay rate: Inpatient hospital stays involving opioid-related diagnoses per 100,000 residents</li> </ul><ol>  <li>Cost Factor Rank: Based on cumulative scores across the following factors:   <ul>   <li>Health care spending as a percentage of state GDP: Government spending on health care and social assistance out of total state GDP</li>   <li>State government spending on health care and social assistance per resident</li>   <li>Average annual private health insurance premium costs</li>  </ul>  </li>  <li>Access Factor Rank: Based on cumulative score across the following factors:  <ul>   <li>Number of hospital beds per 1,000 residents</li>   <li>Number of primary care providers per 100,000 residents</li>   <li>Primary care provider shortage areas (HPSAs) by state: Designations that identify areas of the U.S. experiencing health care professional shortages</li>   <li>Percentage of population with access to any insurance versus just health insurance</li>   <li>Ease of access to care at the doctor's office or clinic using Medicare</li>   <li>Ease of access to care at a specialist using Medicare</li>  </ul>  </li> </ol><p>MoneyGeek used the following weightings in our analysis:</p><ul>  <li>Preventable death rate: Full weight</li>  <li>Infant mortality rate: Full weight</li>  <li>Life expectancy: Half weight</li>  <li>Diabetes mortalities per 100,000 people: Half weight</li>  <li>Obesity as a percentage of the population: Half weight</li>  <li>Hospital inpatient stays involving opioid-related diagnoses per 100,00 people: Quarter weight</li>  <li>Smoking rate among adults: Quarter weight</li>  <li>Suicide deaths among persons ages 12 and older per 100,000 people: Quarter weight</li>  <li>New HIV cases among persons ages 13 and older per 100,000 people: Quarter weight</li>  <li>Annual health insurance costs: Full weight</li>  <li>Health care spending as a percentage of state GDP: Half weight</li>  <li>Health care spending as a share of GDP per resident: Half weight</li>  <li>Percentage of population with health insurance: Full weight</li>  <li>Number of hospital beds per 100,000 people: Half weight</li>  <li>Adults who had a doctor's office or clinic visit in the last 12 months and needed care, tests, or treatment who sometimes or never found it easy to get the care, tests, or treatment, Medicare fee-for-service: Quarter weight</li>  <li>Adults who needed to see a specialist in the last 6 or 12 months who sometimes or never found it easy to see a specialist, Medicare fee-for-service: Quarter weight</li>  <li>Primary care health professional shortage areas: % of need met to remove shortage designation: Quarter weight</li>  <li>Number of primary care providers per 100,000 population: Quarter weight</li> </ul><p>SOURCES</p><ul>  <li>Dartmouth Atlas Project.
