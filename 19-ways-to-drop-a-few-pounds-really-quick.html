    <main><h1>19 Ways to Drop a Few Pounds Really Quick</h1><p>Are you trying to lose weight fast? The bad news: Most get-slim-quick tactics aren't sustainable. Most experts recommend losing one to two pounds per week by following a healthy diet and exercise routine. However, if you are in a hurry to lose weight really quickly, several habits can help you get the job done. Here are 19 expert-recommended things to do if you want to drop a few pounds really quickly.</p><h2>1 When You Lose Weight Fast, It's Usually Water Weight</h2><h2>2 Drink Lots of Water</h2><p>"Number one, I'm going to make sure I'm drinking a ton of water," says Rizzo. "Now, I know a lot of times people think that drinking a ton of water is gonna cause you to retain a ton of water, but it actually does the opposite. You can kind of think of it as flushing out your system."</p><h2>3 Decrease Carb Intake</h2><p>"Number two, I'm gonna be eating slightly lower carbs. So, have you ever heard of when people do keto and they magically drop five pounds in like two days, and everybody thinks it's magic? Well, this is because when you eat carbs, your body's gonna hold onto a certain amount of water weight because of it. So when you cut back on your carbs, your body's gonna be able to let go of a decent bit of water, which again will help us look a little bit tighter and leaner," Rizzo continues.</p><h2>4 Amp Up Fiber and Probiotic Intake</h2><p>"Number three, I'm eating at least 30 grams of fiber and getting some good probiotics in. So this is gonna be really good for your gut help, help keep you regular, if you know what I mean. Gonna help cut down on any inflammation and bloating you might have in your gut," she says.</p><h2>5 Sleep More</h2><p>"And number four, I'm getting as much sleep as I possibly can, and if you know me, you know, I prioritize sleep over almost everything when it comes to weight loss because most people truly aren't getting enough. But in this particular instance, I'm getting good long deep sleep to help cut back any inflammation and unwanted water weight," Rizzo concludes. What are the other health benefits of sleep? According to the Sleep Foundation, getting enough z's is a mood booster, promotes heart health, regulates blood sugar, improves mental function, restores your immune system, and helps relieve stress in addition to aiding in weight loss.</p><h2>6 Walk More</h2><h2>7 Pilates</h2><h2>8 Avoid Saturated Fats</h2><p>As for eating, Ariana doesn't believe you need to be super restrictive. "You don't need to restrict yourself from eating a lot. You just need to eat the right things. Most of us are eating things that are so rich in saturated fat and calories, and that's literally why we eat like a small thing and gain weight," she says.</p><h2>9 Meal Prep</h2><p>Ariana also encourages planning out your meals ahead of time. "I am literally in the process of meal prepping and I'm gonna be having three meals per day, and I'm going to literally lose so much weight. It's gonna be crazy," she says. "You might saying like, 'I don't have the time for that.' You don't have the time for that because you don't meal prep. You don't have the time because you're not organized."</p><figure><img title="9 Meal Prep" src="IMG/BB1mqy1l_9_meal_prep.jpg" alt="9 Meal Prep"><figcaption><em>9 Meal Prep. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10 Eat Lots of Low-Calorie Food</h2><p>Ariana tries to load up on low-calorie food. For example, she will have dairy-free Greek yogurt in the morning from Trader Joe's and then put "coconut flakes, freeze-dried strawberries, blueberries, whatever I wanna put in there that is not high in calories," she says. "Granola, no." For lunch, she will fill up on a cucumber salad with dressing made from the same Greek cashew yogurt, "So it's literally so low in calories. Like the whole thing is probably gonna be like a hundred calories," she says. She also eats "like little fruits here and there throughout the day," followed by dinner,  "either whitefish, cod, chicken, or eggs and chickpeas, and I'm gonna pair that with a Greek salad dinner altogether, maybe max 500 calories," she says. Her base meals total around 1,000 calories, "and that's just like the base. I can literally have wine. I can have a little bit of chocolate here and there. I can add on to that because my goal is just personally, my goal, guys, is just to stay under 1,700 to 1,500 calories," she says.</p><h2>11 No Gluten</h2><p>Ariana maintains a gluten-free diet. "Gluten will literally inflame you so much. Go search it up right now on TikTok, people who literally cut out sugar, dairy, and gluten for a week," she says, revealing it helps keep her skin clear.</p><h2>12 Calculate Your Caloric Limits</h2><h2>13 Calculate Your Protein Minimum</h2><p>"Step two, to find your daily protein minimum, take that goal weight, multiply by 0.6, and that is the amount of grams per day in protein I want you to hit each and every day," he says. "You wanna protect muscle from being lost along with fat."</p><h2>14 Drink a Protein Smoothie</h2><p>He also recommends having "a big green smoothie" with healthy fat and fiber to keep you full. He makes his with half avocado, two scoops, pea protein powder, two big handfuls of spinach, one half cup mixed berries, almond milk, half cup Greek yogurt.</p><h2>15 Track Every Calorie</h2><p>While it might be a pain, Schaefer recommends tracking "each and every calorie to ensure you're hitting your numbers." He recommends using an app like FitnessPal to make it easier.</p><h2>16 Try Intermittent Fasting</h2><figure><img title="16 Try Intermittent Fasting" src="IMG/BB1mqJlQ_16_try_intermittent_fasting.jpg" alt="16 Try Intermittent Fasting"><figcaption><em>16 Try Intermittent Fasting. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>17 Eat at Least Three Meals a Day and a Snack</h2><p>Also, "you need to be eating at least three meals a day in a snack if necessary," says Hadac. "You cannot be starving yourself all day long and then over-consuming calories at night. That's the worst thing you can be doing if you're trying to lose weight."</p><h2>18 Exercise Daily</h2><p>Hadac also stresses the importance of daily exercise. "You need to make sure that you're moving your body every single day. Whether you're hitting the gym, you're walking, you're stretching, doing yoga, whatever it is, move your body," he says.</p><figure><img title="18 Exercise Daily" src="IMG/BB1m9Vgm_18_exercise_daily.jpg" alt="18 Exercise Daily"><figcaption><em>18 Exercise Daily. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>19 Quit Sugar</h2><figure><img title="19 Quit Sugar" src="IMG/AA1nrqBH_19_quit_sugar.jpg" alt="19 Quit Sugar"><figcaption><em>19 Quit Sugar. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>20 Eat Whole Foods</h2><p>Kylie also recommends sticking to whole foods and eliminating "the gross fast food, the McDonald's, the Wendy's, the Taco Bell," from your diet. "All of the processed food needs to be out. What was put on this earth for us to eat is what you need to put into your body. That's what your body can digest. So like eggs, fish, red meat, avocado, like fruits, vegetables, shit like that is what you need to be eating. You don't need to be going and eating a Big Mac and fries and drinking pop," she says.
