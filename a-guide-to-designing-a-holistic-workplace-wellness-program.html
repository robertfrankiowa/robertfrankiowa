    <main><h1>A Guide to Designing a Holistic Workplace Wellness Program</h1><p><p class='fl-subtitle'>Wellness is more than just physical. Here are ways to bring wellness programs to your office.</p><p>Holistic workplace wellness programs ensure optimal employee wellness. It's not a good-to-do--it's a must-do. Unlike traditional wellness programs that focus only on physical elements--such as exercise, smoking cessation, and weight management--a holistic approach helps employees develop healthier lifestyles in <em>all</em> areas of life, including physical, mental, social, emotional, financial, occupational, and intellectual. This can create a healthier and more productive workplace.</p><p>Even on a budget, you can still put together an effective program. Let's break down how you can build a holistic workplace wellness program for your employees.</p><h2>Why holistic wellness matters to business leaders</h2><p>According to a Gallup study, about a third of American workers are engaged at their jobs.</p><p>In contrast, a 2023 MetLife study reports that holistically healthy employees are:</p><ul><li>92 percent more likely to be engaged at work</li><li>65 percent more likely to be loyal</li><li>56 percent more likely to be productive at work</li></ul><p>Entrepreneurs who care about the bottom line should care about employee well-being. In fact, the Harvard Business Review reports that one company estimated that its wellness program generated a return on investment of 271 percent in six years. Healthy employees--wholly healthy--are less stressed, less worried about things like finances, and are better able to focus on their jobs.</p><p>Having preventative wellness solutions in place contributes directly to your bottom line by creating healthier and more productive employees while reducing employee burnout, which causes absenteeism and sometimes short-term disability. A holistic wellness program can reduce these risks by providing employees with tools to address their concerns, manage stress, and improve mental health.</p><p>Holistic workplace wellness programs can also positively contribute to workplace culture because they reflect an attitude of caring and show employees that they are valued as people, not just professionals.</p><p>Think about the concept of putting your oxygen mask on first before helping others. A holistic program is similar. You give your employees oxygen masks so they can take care of themselves first, then focus on company work.</p><h2>How to design a holistic workplace wellness program--even on a budget</h2><p>First, assess your employees' needs in each area (physical, mental, etc.). You can do this through a formal survey or simply by talking to your employees. Next, look at what programs you currently offer and find where there are gaps. You may already have some good tools in place. Once you know what you need, look for experts or programs that could fill those needs.</p><p>Customization can make a holistic workplace wellness program great. For example, a gym membership is a poor fit if employees don't like going to the gym. Maybe their specific needs would be satisfied with nutritional education or support. Discover what resources most of your employees need to succeed, and then be sure to include them in your overall program.</p><p>It can be challenging to understand how to design the program you need without an adequate budget. You can put together a holistic wellness program using minimal funds. There are tons of resources online, and many of them are free. All you have to do is show employees what benefits are available.</p><p>For example, try searching for these resources:</p><ul><li>Workout videos</li><li>Nutritional information</li><li>Yoga or meditation instruction</li><li>Therapy services offered through employee assistance programs (EAPs)</li><li>Financial education from banks and investment companies</li></ul><p>With a larger budget, you can search for therapists or wellness workshops that meet your employees' needs.</p><p>Once you have a program in place, evaluate it. Find out what's working and not working by comparing previous years and by asking employees if they want to do something different. Consider how you can enhance your program to better serve everyone.</p><h2>Not everyone will be on board</h2><p>Sometimes it can be challenging to prioritize holistic wellness programs in the workplace. If an HR person wants to start a program but it's not a priority for upper-level management, then it can be challenging to get buy-in. Management may have different views of wellness.</p><p>For leaders who want to prioritize this, do the research. Statistics on burnout speak volumes and can prove what burnout costs companies. For corporate leaders, some things don't make sense until they make cents. Once they understand that employee wellness reduces absenteeism, increases retention, and improves the bottom line, they're more likely to agree to it.</p><h2>Next steps for your organization</h2><p>Do you make your employees' health and wellness a priority? Evaluate your company. Determine if your organization is prioritizing health and wellness--not just physical health, but whole health. Get started now.</p></main>
