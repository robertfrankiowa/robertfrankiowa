    <main><h1>What’s your ‘little big thing’? How to discover what can boost your mood</h1><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1i5qTr_hm_government.jpg" alt="HM Government"><figcaption><em>Hoping to maintain good mental health? Often it’s the little things that can make a big difference.

Come rain or shine, she pulls on her trainers and heads for the door. </p><p class="">Twenty minutes later, she’s running up and down the hills near her home or haring around mountains on her bike feeling all the pressure disappear. </p><p class="">‘I’ve never got home feeling bad,’ says the 41-year-old from Wakefield. ‘It’s a huge mood boost – you’re in the wilderness, sweaty and muddy, it’s such an adrenaline rush being out in all weathers. So much so, sometimes I don’t want to come home.’</p><p class="">Dalia, who runs a skincare company, discovered the ‘little big thing’ that helps keep her happy earlier this year when she was going through a tough time – work was so busy and she was also learning to drive. </p><p class="">‘Exercise had gone onto a back burner,’ she says. ‘My mindset was that if I went out for an hour for a run or bike ride, I’d have lost time that could’ve been spent doing something else like updating my social media. It felt like a chore.’</p><p class="">But one day her instincts kicked in, and she knew she had to get out of the house. </p><p class="">‘I went around the gardens of a stately home, and it completely changed me,’ she says. ‘I had the best night’s sleep and felt completely better. That was key for me – I got my mojo back. I realised how important exercise was to my state of mind.’ </p><p class="">Since then, Dalia has built cycling and running into her daily schedule knowing just how great it is for her mental health.</p><p class="">She’s one of the millions of Brits who’ve realised that doing one small thing a day for their wellbeing can help them feel a lot better. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1i5vFB_hm_government.jpg" alt="HM Government"><figcaption><em>Building positive habits into her daily schedule, Dalia heads out for a run or a cycle as it’s great for her mental health.

And you often can’t imagine anything having a positive effect on how you feel, especially something small. </p><p class="">However, it IS possible. And there are many things you can do to help yourself. The NHS-approved Better Health – Every Mind Matters website has a host of great ideas and free resources to help improve your mental health.</p><p class="">One of the best ways is to find something you enjoy doing that lifts your mood, and make it part of your daily routine. So why not try: </p><p class=""><strong>Getting active </strong></p><p class="">It’s not just good for you physically but mentally, too, helping you burn off nervous energy and lowering your stress levels. Find something you love, whether it’s dancing, kicking a ball around, Zumba or yoga – and do it regularly. </p><p class="">If you like walking or running, download NHS apps such as the Active 10 walking tracker or Couch to 5K challenge to help you build good habits. </p><p class=""><strong>Talking to someone you trust </strong></p><p class="">Opening up and telling someone how you feel is great for your mental health, and it stops you feeling lonely, too. Yes, it may seem difficult initially but when you do, it’s not only a load off your mind but will help your chosen loved one or friend understand what you’re going through. </p><p class="">It doesn’t even have to be face to face – give them a call or chat online and you’ll find out it’s good to talk. </p><p class="">Making fun plans If you’re finding things tough, get something to look forward to in the diary. It will counter any boredom and lethargy you’re feeling by boosting your mood and giving you energy. </p><p class="">And it doesn’t have to cost – walking the dog with a friend or visiting a free local attraction can make you feel so much better.</p><p class=""><strong>Managing your feelings </strong></p><p class="">Sometimes we’re our own worst enemy, developing negative thought patterns that keep us feeling down. Recognising this and doing something about it can be great for mental health. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1i5fYa_hm_government.jpg" alt="HM Government"><figcaption><em>Don’t allow negative thought patterns to get you down: Do something about it by following practical advice. Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p class="">Go to the Every Mind Matters website for free, practical advice on how to deal with these unhelpful thoughts and work through problems in more positive ways.</p><p class=""><strong>Stepping into nature </strong></p><p class="">Spending time in parks and gardens can lift your mood and help you feel more relaxed. Or why not bring the outdoors in by growing plants on windowsills and balconies? </p><p class=""><strong>Sleeping well </strong></p><p class="">Having a good night’s sleep makes a huge difference to how we feel. And if we’re tossing and turning, it’s all too easy to start focusing on our problems and concerns. So don’t struggle. </p><p class="">Get out of bed and do something, such as reading a book, until you feel tired again. Every Mind Matters has plenty of tips and an email programme to help you develop good bedtime habits. </p><p class=""><strong>NHS Talking Therapies</strong></p><p class="">If you find something you enjoy doing regularly, you should see an improvement in how you feel. However, if you don’t or if you’re struggling with anxiety or depression, the NHS Talking Therapies service is there for you. </p><p class="">The psychological therapies offered by this service are practical and can help with a range of common mental health disorders including depression, phobias, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety, health anxiety, social anxiety, body dysmorphia and post-traumatic stress disorder. </p><p class="">They can also help you cope with anxiety or depression in the context of long-term health conditions such as diabetes or cancer. </p><p class="">Some of these psychological therapies can be accessed online, via text or through an interactive website. You can even refer yourself as long as you’re registered with a GP – go to <strong><em>nhs.uk/talk</em></strong> to find your local NHS Talking Therapies service.</p><p class="">Find your ‘little big thing’ with Every Mind Matters.

She’s a matchmaker and relationship coach. She says: </strong></p><p class="">‘I grew up in a musical home. My mum loved to play loud music and we’d dance together, and my dad was a songwriter and producer so music has always been an important part of my life. But I never associated it with being a form of therapy until my twenties.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/AA1i5lYD_hm_government.jpg" alt="HM Government"><figcaption><em>‘I started to turn to music – it was my therapy’, says mum-of-three Siobhan Copland from Essex. Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p class="">‘Then I experienced some mild depression and realised that if I played sad music, I felt bad but if it was upbeat, I felt good – I’d want to dance, I’d walk a bit faster and have a spring in my step. So I started to turn to music – it was my therapy. </p><p class="">‘Now, every morning, I put music on to motivate myself for the day and dance around my bedroom. If I’ve been up all night with the baby, it makes me feel more energised and willing to take on the day. I dance around the whole house and play music in every room. </p><p class="">‘And because I love music so much, I do a voluntary radio show for two hours every Thursday on a little community station in my area. It’s on Instagram live, and I encourage everyone to dance with me. I think I make them laugh!’</p><h2 class="metro-factbox-title grey exclamation">                    GET 'APPY   </h2><p class=""><strong>The free NHS App is a simple and secure way to access a range of services, including help for mental health</strong>.</p><p class="">It is available to all patients aged 13 and over who are registered with an NHS GP practice in England and the Isle of Man.</p><p class="">Download the NHS App to:</p><ul> <li>Get health advice.</li> <li>Find NHS services near you.</li> <li>Order repeat prescriptions.</li> <li>View your GP health record securely<strong>.</strong></li> </ul><h2 class="metro-factbox-title grey exclamation">                    HOW TO GET HELP IN A CRISIS   </h2><p class=""><strong>If you or someone you love is at breaking point and thinking about suicide or self-harm, it’s important to get professional help quickly rather than struggle on alone. </strong></p><p class="">Book an appointment to see a GP.
