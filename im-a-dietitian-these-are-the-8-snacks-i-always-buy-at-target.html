When you're shopping at Target, the snack aisle is packed with a range of options to choose from, and not all of them are nutritionally balanced. But having a healthy snack at-the-ready is a great way to add some extra nutrition to your day. Plus, if you focus on options that are high in protein and fiber, you are more likely to be full for longer, stabilize your blood sugar levels and maybe even eat more mindfully at your next meal.</p><p>Sure, you can make a healthy snack at home, but there's nothing like an easy bite that's already prepared for you when you need it. Head to Target, and choose one of these dietitian-favorite snacks for a flavorful and nourishing grab-and-go option.</p><h2>1. Tia Lupita Chipotle Cactus Tortilla Chips</h2><p>Made with a unique blend of cassava flour and cactus, these tortilla chips are surprisingly high in fiber. With a whopping 4 grams per serving, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a higher fiber tortilla chip option. Made with sunflower oil and simple seasonings, Tia Lupita’s Tortilla Chips have a delicious flavor and are also grain free for those following a gluten-free diet. Pair these with some salsa and cheese, and you have a balanced snack with protein, carbs and fiber to boot.</p><h2>2. GoodPop's Cherry n' Lemonade Pops</h2><p>I love something sweet after dinner, but sometimes I want something a little lighter than a typical dessert. GoodPop makes a delightfully refreshing option for those times when I just want a sweet palette cleanser after my evening meal. Especially in the warmer months, I love their new Cherry n’ Lemonade flavor. They are made with 100% fruit juice, including cherry and apple juice, and have no added sugar or artificial sweeteners. With just 25 calories per pop, I love to have one or two of these for a satisfying nighttime snack.</p><h2>3. Banza Mac and Cheese</h2><p>If you're looking for a heartier snack, look no further than Banza’s Mac and Cheese. Made with chickpeas and real cheese, this snack packs in 18 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber per serving. That kind of staying power will help this snack keep you full and energized for hours. Plus, if you're feeling like you need even more volume or want to add a serving of vegetables, I love to toss in some broccoli while the noodles are cooking. </p><h2>4. CLIF Builders Protein Bar Minis </h2><p>One of my favorite snacks pre-workout is CLIF Builders Protein Bar Minis, which provides 10 grams of protein, plus carbohydrates to help build and repair muscle and replenish my energy stores after exercise. I love that they don't use high-fructose corn syrup or artificial flavors, and they focus on whole food ingredients for a quick snack on-the-go. Their chocolate mint flavor is especially refreshing in the warmer months, too. </p><h2>5. Chomps Italian Style Beef Stick</h2><p>One of my all-time favorite car snacks is Chomps Beef Sticks. In particular, their Italian Style flavor is both delicious and offers 9 grams of protein per stick. A far cry from a Slim Jim when it comes to their nutrition, Chomps use simple seasonings and prioritize whole food ingredients. For a more balanced snack, I'll pair this with a piece of fruit on the side to make sure that I get a combination of protein and carbs for a filling one-two punch at snack time.</p><h2>6. Lundberg Organic Thin Stackers</h2><p>It's hard to find rice cakes that also come with whole grains and a high-fiber nutrition label, but Lundberg has done it. Their Thin Stackers come packaged with just brown rice, red rice and quinoa as the three ingredients. With 2 grams of fiber per 4 rice cakes, I love that I'm also getting a fiber boost to start my snack. A smear of peanut butter, chia seeds and banana round out the snack nicely with carbohydrates, healthy fat and a little protein. These also come dipped in dark chocolate if you’re looking for a sweeter option, perhaps for an after-dinner snack.</p><h2>7. Prunes</h2><p>Perhaps a less popular snack, this dried fruit doesn't get enough love if you ask me. These guts-supporting little morsels offer a delicious midday sweet snack and pair perfectly with cheese and crackers. One serving of about five prunes provides 3 grams of fiber helping to regulate your blood sugar, provide more sustained energy and keep your hunger in check. Plus, a serving also has 20% of the daily value of vitamin K and may be beneficial for bone health, blood clotting, digestive health and more.</p><h2>8. Pistachios</h2><p>Pistachios offer healthy fat, complete protein and fiber—a triple threat to stave off hunger after snack time. They also provide plant compounds that could reduce the risk of heart disease. With 6 grams of complete protein per serving, you'll feel full longer and have more sustained blood sugar levels. While they are delicious on their own, I love to pair them with a source of carbohydrates like crackers, fruit or yogurt to boost my energy levels even more.</p></main>
