    <main><h1>What Happens If You Eat Eggs Every Day? Nutritionists Share the Benefits</h1><p>Whether you scramble them up with some bacon and toast, hard boil and chop 'em up for a salad or enjoy one fried on top of a burger, eggs are a kitchen staple. Of course, they're a great source of protein (one of the cheapest on the market, too!), but what happens if you eat eggs every day? Are there other health benefits that come from eating eggs? Are there health <em>risks</em>? <em>Woman's World </em>turned to the experts to uncover the need-to-know info about one of the most popular superfoods. Keep reading to learn what happens if you eat eggs every day and how to incorporate them into a balanced diet. </p><h2>What happens if you eat eggs every day? The upsides</h2><p>Bottom line: Eggs are perfectly fine to eat every day. That's because "eggs count as both a protein and fat which means you're only missing one element to eat optimally for your metabolism," explains Amanda Sauceda, MS, RD, a gut health nutritionist. "You want to center your meals around PFF: protein, fat, and fiber." They are also full of vitamins, including B12, riboflavin and selenium - eating a whole egg is a fantastic and easy way to get necessary nutrients. </p><p>An average egg has about 5 grams of fat, per the USDA, and Sauceda says it's safe to incorporate them into your daily diet as long as you're monitoring your sodium and saturated fat intake.</p><h3>You'll be kickstarting meeting your daily protein goals </h3><p>"Whole eggs - including the yolks - are loaded with high-quality protein, about six to eight grams per large egg," says Chris Mohr, PhD, RD, fitness and nutrition advisor at Fortune Recommends Health. "This protein helps with muscle repair and recovery from physical activity." He recommends starting your day with one to two eggs for breakfast because they give you a high protein kick right away and that'll help you stay energized. (The average woman should be getting anywhere from 54-80 grams of protein per day, according to Harvard Health.</p><p><strong>See also: </strong>Experts Share the 8 Best Brain Foods to Boost Focus, Prevent Memory Loss and More </p><h3>You might lose weight if you eat eggs every day</h3><figure><img title="Provided by Woman's World" src="IMG/BB1oi1I8_carton_of_eggs_at_the_store.jpg" alt="Carton of eggs at the store"><figcaption><em>Carton of eggs at the store, which you can eat every day.

Michelle Routhenstein, MS, preventive cardiology dietitian, registered dietitian nutritionist, and certified diabetes educator, explains that eggs have a high satiety factor, so you'll feel full for longer periods. "This satiety effect may aid in weight management by reducing overall calorie intake and curbing hunger between meals," she says.</p><h3>Your vision can improve</h3><p>Egg yolks contain two carotenoids, or beneficial antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin, which are great for eye health. These carotenoids may also help to reduce the risk of macular degeneration, notes Routhenstein. These are essential nutrients that many people don't get nearly enough of in their diet.</p><p>"Choline is not talked about enough with how important it is for brain health and development, especially early on in life," says Sauceda. Most people don't consume foods with enough choline, but one large, whole egg has 147 mg of choline and women should be getting 425 milligrams of it per day.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Woman's World" src="IMG/BB1oi6Is_bowl_of_egg_yolks.jpg" alt="Bowl of egg yolks"><figcaption><em>Bowl of egg yolks, which you can eat every day.

"Eggs are one of the few food sources that have Vitamin D which is a vitamin that many people are deficient in," says Sauceda. Make sure to eat the yolk, which is where you'll actually get the Vitamin D.</p><h2>What happens if you eat eggs every day? The downside</h2><p>It's been said repeatedly that eggs can raise your cholesterol, however, Routhenstein points out that they're likelier to increase cholesterol levels in those who are LDL (low-density lipoproteins) responders <em>and </em>have high genetic heart disease risk. "In the general population, the dietary cholesterol in eggs does not have a significant impact on blood cholesterol levels," says Routhenstein.</p><p>Mohr adds that there are really no big downsides to eating eggs every day unless you're allergic, or constantly eating them with fattier foods like sausage or bacon because then the "eggs would be the best part of that entire meal."
