    <main><h1>31 Products That'll Help You Get The Best Sleep Of Your Life</h1><h2>1.A pair of chic wireless headband sleep headphones so you can keep your ears comfortable listening to music, white noise, or calming affirmations as you drift off. </h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I purchased this product to be able to listen to affirmations as I fall asleep. <strong>It has been great for that, and has also been very beneficial on long airplane flights when my ears hurt from the AirPods being in for so long.</strong> Also a great option when you are sleeping in a room with someone who snores! My kids keep stealing this from me so I purchased two more to get them for Christmas!" —Dawn Cooperider</p><h2>2.<em>No Worries: A Guided Journal,</em> a popular self-guided journal designed to help with managing anxiety, stress, and the general "adkfjgaldkjfgalkj" in your brain so you can rest a bit easier at night. Each day has a similar set of prompts for 12 undated weeks to help you reflect on your thought patterns and sources of anxiety, and gradually find self-care practices and management strategies that suit you best. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I’ve never been a journal or diary person,<strong> but needed an outlet for my anxiety and stress</strong>. Each day has the same two-page spread that prompts you to think about your day, how you felt, and why you felt that way. There isn’t really any inspiration or advice, just open lines for your thoughts without it being an intimidating blank page. <strong>This journal has already helped me see patterns in my thoughts/emotions and I feel better overall.</strong> I would recommend this journal to anyone." —Kari Madsen</p><h2>3.A guided visual "breathing partner" you can use for meditation and calm to get yourself in a better mindset for sleep. This is designed to guide you through either the popular 4/7/8 or 5/5 "calming breaths" to help reduce stress and anxiety, using colors that fade in and out softly as cues. Bonus: it's kid-friendly! </h2><p>Mindset is a small business that specializes in calming personal care and decor products. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Who doesn’t need less stress and more sleep these days! Here's your breathing meditation partner. Very useful at your desk and bed stand. So easy to charge and use, not to mention that he’s really cute!" —Cece</p><h2>4.A pack of drug-free Breathe Right nasal strips reviewers quite literally claim "saved their marriage" — these provide instant snoring *and* congestion relief by increasing nasal airflow. Bonus: there's an optional "scratch and sniff" lavender scent if you want an extra dose of calm. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This product is a true gem. I’m eight months pregnant, and due to the baby pressing on my diaphragm, I’ve begun to snore terribly. <strong>My poor husband is a light sleeper, so I needed to figure something out. I started applying this at night, and he says he doesn’t hear a peep out of me!</strong> If you have trouble sleeping or snoring, this is something you need." —Raevyn</p><h2>5.A set of delightfully ~~tingly~~ self-heating soothing foot masks made with Epsom salts, lavender, and peppermint perfect for anyone whose recent step count is "too many." Nothing like a lil' self-care on those aching feet to get into relaxation mode before bed! </h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1mWPru_feet_propped_up_with_two_metallic_foot_masks_on_them.jpg" alt="Feet propped up with two metallic foot masks on them"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>Check out a TikTok of the foot masks in action. </p><p>I'm a long-ish distance runner, and these were certainly an interesting experience for my feet!<strong> You slide them on and, after a few minutes, feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation.</strong> It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes. <strong>After that my feet felt very refreshed and relaxed at a time of day when they're usually aching from all the miles I put in.</strong> The whole thing was a mess-free, easy process, and I will definitely keep them on hand for longer run days! </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "These masks soften my feet right away after only one us<strong>e. I recommend using them before bed but do not discard them yet</strong>. You can use the same pair again the next morning as some products remain in the masks." —Guy Kositrana</p><h2>6.A set of review-beloved moisture-wicking double-brushed microfiber sheets with a softness so luxurious that you'll be like, "Cotton <em>whomst??</em>" Reviewers especially love that the "cooling" effect of these is no joke, particularly for people in hot climates or people experiencing night sweats and hot flashes. </h2><p>P<strong>romising review</strong>: “LOVE THESE!! I was searching for a sheet set that would help me sleep more comfortably at night and found these. <strong>I have terrible hot flashes with night sweats</strong> and get up in the morning, just miserable. Of course, these do not eliminate my hot flashes as no sheets will, but they definitely <strong>make my nights much more comfortable</strong> by eliminating wet bedding, and I definitely appreciate that! Aside from their moisture-wicking abilities, they are very soft, easy to look at, and launder extremely well.<strong> I would highly recommend these for anyone shopping for sheet sets and especially for anyone experiencing night sweats!!</strong>” —Shannon Warfel</p><h2>7.And a set of wildly popular ~hotel~ pillows that will make you feel like a lil' cherub falling asleep on a breezy cloud. Reviewers are obsessed with how these manage to be soft but firm at the same time, and how they're so breathable and cooling that they're basically a must-have for anyone who overheats at night. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "These had great reviews, but I was still skeptical. I'm a bit of a pillow snob. <strong>These pillows — these amazing, heavenly pillows — are now my favorite part of going to bed. Soft but firm.</strong> How does that work? It gives support for me to sleep slightly propped up but I sink into this comfortable personal cloud. Soft but firm. My head isn't sinking through the pillow to rest on my mattress, but I feel comfortably enveloped. Heaven. I bought two but think that would be too much fluff, so now my husband and I each have one. <strong>Buy them. Add to cart. Buy now with one click. Stop the research. You've found the pillows you were looking for.</strong>" —Marissa Urey</p><h2>8.Plus a satin pillowcase to invest in not only for its cooling effect, but the fact that it's soft on your skin and creates less friction for your hair so that it won't get as tangled while you sleep. Reviewers also swear by these for helping clear up their acne and love how easy these are to wash while still maintaining their quality. </h2><p>Kitsch is an LA-based, self-financed, woman-owned small business established in 2010 that specializes in hair accessories. </p><p>Check out a TikTok of the Kitsch satin pillowcase in action. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I'm really liking this pillow. <strong>I woke up today with nice wavy hair, not dry tangled hair.</strong> I've been trying to grow out the layer of hair on the top back of my head and it's been so stubborn! Keeps getting tangled and breaks here and there from bleaching and dye damage, but <strong>with this new pillow I notice it doesn't tangle, which means it can grow right without rubbing and tangling/pulling!</strong> So I'm excited to see what happens by the end of summer! Also the pillow is soft and is so much more prettier in person! 😍😍😍💖💖💖" —Amazon Customer 🌷</p><h2>9.A set of light-dimming stickers you can stick on all the LED lights blasting their glow like tiny UFOs in your room at night. They come in a pack of all different sizes, so you can find the perfect ones to match your gizmos and finally get the restful sleep you deserve every night.</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1oIsBz_hand_holding_a_portable_led_display_device_with_blue_illuminated_numbers.jpg" alt="Hand holding a portable LED display device with blue illuminated numbers"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "Who knew such a simple little thing would actually help you sleep better? Works just as advertised. No more annoying lights to keep me up at night!" —Margo A. Castorena</p><h2>10.A set of wax earplugs that mold to the shape of your inner ear like putty, fully blocking out noises like snoring, car honking, or the night owl in your home queueing up <em>The Office</em> who forgot, yet again, to turn the sound down before the theme started playing on full blast 🫠. </h2><p><strong>You can check out my review of Macks Earplugs for more deets: </strong>"The moldable silicone of Mack's Earplugs contours easily to the shape of your ear to block out noise much more effectively than other foam or plastic varieties, and the noise reduction is so good that if I pair them with a white noise machine (or just like a white noise loop on Spotify) I genuinely don't hear noises from outside my room. Not only that, but once they're in place, they stay locked there until you decide to pull them out. <strong>I've also *loved* these for traveling — if you put these babies in on a plane not only does it help reduce some of the YIKES factor when the plane takes off (it's loud!!), but it cancels out the murmuring noises of passengers on the flight and makes it easier to get some shuteye.</strong>"</p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I had to travel for work and stayed in hotels. Noise always was a problem. These were the best solution to lessen noise <strong>because they mold to your ear better than foam ear plugs."</strong> —Bizeec</p><h2>11.And a set of reviewer-beloved "Loops," a meticulously designed ear plug that effectively blocks out distracting, irritating, or overwhelming noise without completely blocking out the world around you (a boon for parents who want to keep an ear out!). </h2><p>Each set comes with a carrying case and several sizes of silicone tips to get your perfect fit! </p><p>I recently used these at Taylor Swift's Eras tour, and could not swear by them more. I had what I fondly describe as the literal worst seats in the stadium (behind the stage in the 300s, help, lol) and not only did these <strong>block the WALLS of noise from my beloved fellow Swifties, it funneled Taylor's audio so I could hear the music more clearly.</strong> The few times I pulled them out I couldn't hear her as well, and the noise was quite overwhelming. <strong>It made the concert a calmer, more enjoyable experience. </strong></p><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"Got these to use at night while sleeping, and I would definitely recommend and rebuy.<strong> The noise cancellation is just enough where I can sleep comfortably.</strong> My concern before buying was that they would block out too much noise, and for safety reasons, I wanted to still be able to hear any alarms or alarming noises. That doesn’t seem to be the case. <strong>I can still hear the important stuff, but am able to sleep because the snoring that I usually hear is majorly cut back."</strong> —PB Mom </p><p>Check out the Loop Store on Amazon for more options based on your sound blocking needs! </p><h2>12.A contoured sleep mask designed to alleviate pressure from your eyes and plunge you into total delicious darkness all night long, while staying put on your head without any Velcro snagging in your hair in the middle of the night.</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1n3LGi_inside_of_mask_showing_contoured_part_around_the_eyeball.jpg" alt="Inside of mask showing contoured part around the eyeball"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>I personally swear by this eye mask! I live in a super bright area and closing the window curtains makes me irrationally sad, so I use these to get to sleep and it's like lights out on the universe. These are also REALLY great for days when your work schedule is wonky or you need to take a day nap, <strong>since it not only blocks out all the light, but the contouring means it won't smudge your mascara if you're wearing any.</strong> It's also super comfy and never snags in my hair, even when it's not in a ponytail. </p><h2>13.Or a Nodpod, a strap-free weighted sleep mask designed for back *and* side sleepers with a gentle pressure to encourage stress relief and deep sleep.</h2><p>Nodpod is a small business specializing in sleep products. </p><p>Psst — you can also put it in the freezer, and the microbeads in the mask will stay cool for hours. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "There's something about placing <strong>this weighted thing on my eyes when I'm tossing and turning that lulls me back to sleep</strong>. The shape of it is a bit weird — it's not a typical eye mask, it's much bulkier and doesn't fasten on in the same way — but once you get beyond that, this can really be a beautiful thing. <strong>I keep it on my bedside table and use it if I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep (which happens often) or once the sun rises and I want to sleep in a little more.</strong> If you have sleep issues I'd recommend trying this novel product." —Veronicam</p><h2>14.A migraine relief beanie for when your brain decides it's going to rattle against your skull at the least convenient time possible. (AKA, RIGHT BEFORE BED!!) This gets icy *and* hot depending on what kind of relief you're looking for, and doubles as a sleep mask so you can block out harsh light or try to get some shut-eye for further relief. </h2><p>IceBeanie is a small business that specializes in cold therapy products. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I don’t usually write reviews but this thing is literally a game changer. Amazing quality, so comfortable to wear, and it really helps me to relax and also when I have a headache. This is top shelf. I am so happy with my purchase!" —Bonnie Boughton</p><h2>15.A caffeine-free herbal Sweet Dreams tea designed to promote better sleep with a mixture of chamomile rose blossoms and mint herbs, which have calming as heck properties.</h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I have been having trouble sleeping A LOT lately, I'm very sensitive to sounds/light to where I wake up frustrated and ready to get out of bed to just get the day done. <strong>Now let me tell you that the first night, within seconds of sipping my tea, I yawn nonstop and am ready for bed. Knocked out and didn't wake up/toss or turn the entire night, woke up feeling so much better. </strong>Actually woke up smiling, too!" —Isa</p><h2>16.An affordable sunrise alarm clock so you can trick your human brain into thinking you're already dappled in the light of a bright, sunshiny day when you wake up, even if the the sun hasn't quite caught up to your morning routine.</h2><p>This can be programmed with seven different light settings, seven different calming "wake up" noises, and to start gradually lighting up at 30, 20, or 10 minutes before you wake. </p><p><strong>Promising review: "</strong>I got this recommendation from TikTok, and it really has helped, especially with Oregon winters where the sun is not out by the time the alarm rings. <strong>It has several peaceful alarm settings and even has night music to put you to sleep.</strong> The sunrise with the alarm piano is what I play to wake me up every morning and it is a way better way than to wake up to an annoying phone alarm." —Amazon Customer</p><h2>17.Or a gorgeously designed Hatch Restore 2 — this sunrise alarm and sound machine works overtime as a touch-controlled smart light, bedtime reading light, and even a wind-down light that helps you get into a healthier sleep routine at night. Other bedside lamps could truly never.</h2><p>Hatch Restore lets you personalize a "bedtime routine" for each night to train your brain to recognize sleep cues and get a better night's rest. Options include changing the light settings to more amber tones to help produce melatonin for sleep, soothing noise options, and sleep meditations and sleep stories you can get in the Hatch app. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "The Hatch Restore 2 is truly a game changer for those looking to improve their night’s sleep and wake-up routine.<strong> It’s been the best bedside companion and has improved my overall health and well-being.</strong> The combination of sounds, lights, buttons, and aesthetics really all come to play to make this feel like a truly premium device. There are touch adjustments to adjust the volume and brightness of the clock, which work really well. My favorite feature is the physical buttons which you can press to start or stop the routines;<strong> it feels very intentional when I get ready for bed and really gets me in the right mindset to begin my bedtime routine</strong>." —Natasha Advani</p><h2>18.A dual-zone comforter to quite possibly save y'all's relationship, particularly if you can never agree on where the thermostat should be. One side of this comforter runs cool, and the other one runs hot, so you can sleep under whichever side you prefer without waking up when one of you hogs or throws off the covers in the middle of the night.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This comforter is <strong>what we’ve always needed</strong>. My husband and I are always tangled in blankets because I need more but yet they always end up on his side. <strong>This comforter provides an all-in-one solution that keeps me warm and him cool and our bedroom looking calm and zen.</strong>" —Hannah</p><h2>19.An insulated soundproofing strip that easily sticks to the outer rims of your door, giving you some peace and quiet at bedtime and making it *much* less likely that you'll hear people rooting around the Cheez-Its box in the kitchen in the middle of the night.</h2><p>Psst — this insulated strip also stops air conditioning and heat from escaping out of the crack under the door, saving energy and money! </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Lifesaver. I have roommates who always watch TV loudly until midnight, so I purchased this to seal the gap in my door. It really reduced 90% of the noise from the living room!!! I can finally have a nice sleep!!!" —wen yan</p><h2>20.A plush memory foam mattress topper to quickly transform any old spring mattress into an oasis — this helps distribute your weight on your mattress more evenly to reduce pressure on your joints, so you're less likely to toss and turn.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This thing has changed my sleep for the better. My mattress has always been kind of uncomfortable with painful springs, but I just put up with it. <strong>Since switching to working nights and sleeping during the day, I wake up more easily and needed something to help me fall asleep and stay asleep.</strong> This topper is so nice! It doesn’t feel cool to the touch, I just don’t overheat while I sleep. It’s so soft I can fall asleep without a pillow. I love it!" —Avery Basford</p><h2>21.Or a pillow-top mattress pad so you can pretend you're sleeping on Mount Olympus. (What up, Zeus??) Not only is this down alternative fill fluffy and soft as heck, but it's wick-away and ventilated to help keep you cool while you snooze. </h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1ofQ0u_a_reviewers_photo_which_shows_the_loft_of_the_mattress_topper.jpg" alt="A reviewer's photo which shows the loft of the mattress topper"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "Whoaaa this thing is amazing. I have a very expensive, firm mattress that I bought when I was younger. I got this, put this over the foam mat, and it’s like a new mattress. <strong>I slept like a rock last night. Haven’t slept that well in a long time.</strong> I also like that it’s attached to the mattress pad, so it’s not sliding all over. It slept very cool, I’m assuming that’s because is cotton. <strong>Highly recommend if you’re looking to fix a mattress and not have to spend money on a new one</strong>." —Julie</p><h2>22.A high-end sound machine that never ever ever loops, bless its technological heart, and has soundscapes so satisfyingly realistic that Dream You will be like, "Um, am I the main character swimming under this rushing waterfall/burrowed by this crackling fireplace/frolicking through this lush meadow?" Bonus — it's also adaptive and changes its volume and mix based on what it hears in your environment. </h2><p>Adaptive Sound Technologies is a small business established in 2009 specializing in sound technology for personal care. </p><p>Psst — it's compatible with speakers *and* headphones, so if you're sharing the room you don't have to subject your partner to it.</p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I have suffered from insomnia all my life, and have found if I fall asleep listening to something I sleep better. I tried falling asleep to the TV, but invariably around 3 a.m., I would wake up listening to infomercials. <strong>Then, while traveling, my husband and I stayed in a very nice hotel that had this product in our room. I tried it, and slept like a baby the whole time we were there! </strong>I knew I had to have one at home, and ordered this as soon as we got home. I love that it has so many different sounds to choose from, as well as volume adjustment. <strong>You can leave it on all night or set the timer to shut off.</strong> This is a fantastic product, and while not inexpensive, in my opinion, well worth the money." —Tamstrat</p><h2>23.A handy dandy amber reading light that's 99.94% free of blue spectrum light — aka, the light that signals to your brain that it's daytime and keeps you up and attem. Now you can read your book at night without disrupting your unsuspecting circadian rhythms. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This is a fantastic light! I use it every evening to continue reading while my son sleeps, it does not wake him or impede my sleep after I’m ready to go to bed. Great product." —Brian Masters</p><h2>24.A Sleep Pod, aka a snuggly adult swaddle blanket that'll cocoon you like a snug little bug in a rug. It applies gentle pressure while still staying cool and breathable, so it basically mimics a light hug you can get a good night's sleep in.</h2><p>Hug Sleep is a Wisconsin-based, family-owned small business that specializes in quality products to improve sleep. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I’ve used it for 10 nights now, and by night 4, I was hooked. It washed up well — quick dry too! I’m autistic and loving the swaddled feel at night, especially during these hot months when my weighted blanket makes no sense." —Kathryn Whittier</p><h2>25.And a weighted Bearaby napper that answers the question of, "What would it look like if a blanket had magic sleep-inducing powers?" This breathable chunky knit blanket is designed with a comforting weight to help soothe anxiety and promote calm, making it easier not just to fall asleep, but *stay* asleep. </h2><p>I've been using this weighted blanket for about three years now and <strong>what I find really remarkable about it is that I *never* feel overheated in it</strong>. It's also just so, SO soft, and looks absolutely beautiful at the foot of my bed where I leave it every night.<strong> It definitely helps me activate "sleep mode" at night </strong>— I find the weight very comforting and not at all stifling, because it spreads so evenly. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I’m in love with my this blanket! It is absolutely gorgeous and has made a remarkable difference in my sleeping habits.<strong> If you are even thinking about a weighted blanket, this is a MUST!</strong> Just do it! You will only wish you’d done it sooner!" —Sandy </p><p>Psst — to choose a style, Bearaby recommends a blanket that is about ten percent of your body weight. </p><h2>26.A dream balm made with calming herbs and essential oils like lavender, chamomile, mugwort, and valerian to help you nod off to dreamland and actually *stay* there.</h2><p>Y'all, I am one of the world's worst sleepers and I swear by this HARD — particularly for when I wake up in the middle of the night and my brain is in "ah, let's think all the thoughts we've ever had at the SAME TIME" mode. I rub it on my temples and the insides of my wrists and take a big whiff from the canister and<strong> it's usually a lot easier for me to doze back off, when typically I might spend *hours* trying to conk back out. </strong>I've also found a little bit of this goes a long way — I've had this a few months and doubt I'll have to replace it for awhile!  </p><p>Woodland Herbal is an Ohio-based Etsy shop established in 2018 that specializes in skincare, salves, and tea blends. </p><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I tried it last night and I haven’t slept this hard in a long time. The smell alone is soothing when you put it on your temples as you drift off to sleep. I usually toss and turn but I slept like a rock." —Emily Irvin</p><h2>27.A pair of breathable, lightweight satin pajamas that will make you feel like you're staying in a hotel suite instead of the same bed you frequently find stray Goldfish crumbs in between laundry days. </h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "These are the best pajamas I've ever purchased. I'm completely hooked. The quality is amazing and they're super comfortable. I will be ordering all the other colors." —Mandie</p><h2>28.A pack of cult-fave nonmedicated Vicks VapoPatches — these mess-free, wearable patches help relieve congestion with a blend of eucalyptus, essential oils, and menthol, so you can still get your ~beauty sleep~ even when your immune system/allergies aren't feeling quite as beauteous as you'd like. </h2><p>A heads-up that these are meant to be worn *over* your clothes. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I was pleasantly surprised when the scent lasted all night! They absolutely help me sleep better when I have a cold. I ordered some for my mother so she’d have them on hand for the upcoming cold and flu season." —Ashley </p><h2>29.A tub of Lush's silky sleepy lotion for real overachievers, so you can get your skincare *and* sleepcare taken care of in one go. This is made with lavender and tonka to promote relaxation, and cocoa butter and almond oil to keep your skin moisturized and soft so you wake up fresh as a daisy. </h2><p><strong>Promising review</strong>: "I love this cream dearly. I have so much trouble sleeping due to stress and anxiety. But, <strong>I think I may have Pavlov's-dogged myself with this lotion. Whenever I put on Sleepy, the lavender and tonka scent immediately relaxes my body.</strong> It has gotten to the point where I use the Sleepy bath bomb or shower gel before bed to prep myself mentally and physically for bed." —Princess Jo</p><p><strong>Here's what BuzzFeeder Heather Braga has to say about it: </strong>"I’m a pretty anxious person and have a hard time getting my brain to shut down before bed. This has been an absolute game changer for me. It’s not too thick, smells heavenly, and a little goes a long way. I apply to my chest and arms so the scent can easily lull me to sleep." </p><h2>30.A splurgeworthy side sleeper pillow so gamechanging that you'll wish you had a time machine back to all the nights you slept without it. Reviewers swear by this pillow to help align their spine for relief from neck and shoulder pain, and *love* the genuinely cooling feeling the down alternative, gel memory foam insides. </h2><p>Honeydew is a small business that specializes in uniquely-designed sleep products. </p></main>
