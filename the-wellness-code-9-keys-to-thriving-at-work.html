    <main><h1>The Wellness Code: 9 Keys to Thriving at Work</h1><p>Wellness at work is crucial on many levels. People are more creative and productive when they are healthy and happy. So when the staff feels great, their work will also be great. Every organization should do its best to uphold its employees’ well-being by implementing these ten tips to improve wellness in the workplace.</p><h2>Promote Office Wellness and Health at Work</h2><p>Establish a wellness culture by creating communication channels focused on healthy eating, exercising, quality sleep, and an active lifestyle. Address the office-related health issues and promote advice to combat them.</p><figure><img title="Promote Office Wellness and Health at Work" src="IMG/AA1dfLf5_promote_office_wellness_and_health_at_work.jpg" alt="Promote Office Wellness and Health at Work"><figcaption><em>Promote Office Wellness and Health at Work.

Do your best to provide good working conditions such as proper ventilation, lighting, comfortable chairs with back support, and plenty of space between desks. Of course, any other amenities and comforts you can offer are welcome.</p><figure><img title="Ensure Comfort in the Office" src="IMG/AA1cGu0c_ensure_comfort_in_the_office.jpg" alt="Ensure Comfort in the Office"><figcaption><em>Ensure Comfort in the Office.

People are more creative and productive at work when their surroundings are orderly and clean. Make sure the floor is cleaned daily and the surfaces are dusted regularly. Provide paper towels and spray cleaners so people can regularly clean their desks.</p><figure><img title="Keep the Office Clean and Organized" src="IMG/AA1exTjj_keep_the_office_clean_and_organized.jpg" alt="Keep the Office Clean and Organized"><figcaption><em>Keep the Office Clean and Organized.

They can make us feel more relaxed and even slightly clean the air. Also, some cool furniture, shelves with inspirational books, and some art can contribute to a creative, inspirational work environment. </p><figure><img title="Add Plants and Inspiration" src="IMG/AA1gFrD9_add_plants_and_inspiration.jpg" alt="Add Plants and Inspiration"><figcaption><em>Add Plants and Inspiration.

Turn on the lights only on gloomy days and when it gets dark. Exposure to more natural light can have multiple benefits, such as helping workers maintain a healthier circadian rhythm.</p><h2>Connect With Your Coworkers</h2><p>While this may not seem like the typical office wellness tip, connecting with the people you work with is important. Hold regular meetings and talk about your work. Discuss your problems and pain points, and think of creative solutions. Bond with the people you work with, try to be more than colleagues to make the days at the office more pleasant, and support one another.</p><h2>Keep Your Desk Clean and Organized</h2><p>Remember to clean your desk from time to time. This includes the computer keyboard and mouse as well.</p><h2>Limit the Use of Air Fresheners in the Office</h2><p>Many air fresheners contain chemicals some people may find irritating. With so many people sharing one space, finding one universal smell enjoyed by all would be difficult. </p><h2>Generational Shift: 18 Classic Cars Loved by Boomers, Snubbed by Millennials</h2><p>In the world of automobiles, some cars are timeless, forever etched in the minds and hearts of those who drove them.
