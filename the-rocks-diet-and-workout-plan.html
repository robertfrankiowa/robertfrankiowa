    <main><h1>The Rock’s Diet and Workout Plan</h1><p>For Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock, workouts and a diligent diet are quite simply a way of life. Accordingly, the California-born college athlete turned WWE sensation turned A-list movie star cuts a truly impressive figure, as anyone with working eyeballs and access to a screen can attest. And while some of that mean muscle came naturally, the bulk of it results from next-level dedication in every conceivable department. That said, he still makes room for the occasional cheat day. Something tells us he earned it.</p><p>It’s then no surprise that adopting The Rock diet and workout plan isn’t a matter of access as much as it is a matter of conviction. Well, that and a decent budget, since you’ll be spending <em>a lot </em>on food. Should you take on this training regimen, however, you might one day flaunt a body like the one he did in “Hercules” or “Fast 5” or any other movie he’s been in because he’s pretty much always fit. But are you up to the task, young go-getter? Let’s find out.</p><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li>The Rock Diet Plan<ul><li>Five-Meal Diet Plan</li><li>Seven-Meal Diet Plan</li></ul></li><li>The Rock Workout Plan<ul><li>Day 1: Legs</li><li>Day 2: Back</li><li>Day 3: Shoulders</li><li>Day 4: Arms/Abs</li><li>Day 5: Legs</li><li>Day 6: Chest</li><li>Day 7: Rest</li></ul></li><li>The Rock Workout FAQ</li></ul><figure><img title="Provided by Man of Many US" src="IMG/AA1jVUWO_dwayne_the_rock_johnson_and_zac_efron_at_the_beach.jpg" alt="Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Zac Efron at the beach"><figcaption><em>Dwayne Johnson as Mitch Buchannon and Zac Efron as Matt Brody in ‘Baywatch’ | Image: Paramount Pictures.

As such, you’ll always find him posting fitness videos to YouTube or selling The Rock workout gear or gracing Instagram with pictures of his hearty meals. He even launched two short-lived reality shows called “Hero” and “Wake Up Call,” where he personally motivated others toward physical and mental transformation. Like we said, spreading the love is a massive part of his game plan.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Man of Many US" src="IMG/AA1jVSci_the_rock_post_workout_image_post_on_instagram.jpg" alt="The Rock post-workout image post on Instagram"><figcaption><em>The Rock post-workout | Image: Instagram. Provided by Man of Many US</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Rock takes a “go big or go home” attitude toward just about everything he does, including his diet. What we’re trying to say here is that he eats like a grizzly bear, albeit a (mostly) healthy one.</p><p>Sometimes The Rock’s diet can go to crazy extremes. For example, when prepping for the role of Hercules, it was reported that he ate up to seven protein-rich meals a day. That amounted to a whopping total of 4,131 calories, which is basically twice the recommended average for men. When not in training, he normally eats about five meals a day, and we’re talking <em>meals</em>.</p><p>As you can probably guess, Johnson loves himself a juicy steak along with other tasty proteins. And if you’ve ever visited The Rock’s insanely popular Instagram feed, then you know his cheat meals are downright epic. Of course, everything this dude does is epic, so why would his cheat meals be any exception?</p><p>Think steak, fish, whole grains, eggs, green veggies, protein, protein, and more protein, and you’re getting a pretty good idea of what The Rock is cookin’. It’s all planned out in advance and devoured with relish.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Five-Meal Diet Plan</h3><p>When he’s not building mass for a role, The Rock eats the following (as an example):</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #1</h4><ul> <li>10 oz steak</li>    <li>2 cups oatmeal</li>    <li>3 egg whites</li>    <li>1 whole egg</li>    <li>1 glass watermelon juice</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #2</h4><ul> <li>2 servings chicken</li>    <li>2 bell peppers</li>    <li>3 cups mushrooms</li>    <li>3 cups broccoli</li>    <li>1 protein shake</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #3</h4><ul> <li>8 oz salmon</li>    <li>8 asparagus tips</li>    <li>2 whole eggs</li>    <li>2 cups rice medley</li>    <li>3 cups broccoli</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #4</h4><ul> <li>10 oz steak</li>    <li>3 baked potatoes</li>    <li>8 asparagus tips</li>    <li>1 glass orange juice</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #5</h4><ul> <li>20 grams casein protein</li>    <li>10 egg whites</li> </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seven-Meal Diet Plan</h3><p>As we mentioned above, when The Rock was training for 2014’s “Hercules,” he consumed calories like it was nobody’s business. For all the extremists (or completists) out there, here’s one of his seven-meal diet plans:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #1</h4><ul> <li>10 oz cod</li>    <li>2 whole eggs</li>    <li>2 cups of oatmeal</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #2</h4><ul> <li>8 oz cod</li>    <li>12 oz sweet potato</li>    <li>1 cup veggies</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #3</h4><ul> <li>8 oz chicken</li>    <li>2 cups white rice</li>    <li>1 cup veggies</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #4</h4><ul> <li>8 oz cod</li>    <li>2 cups rice</li>    <li>1 cup veggies</li>    <li>1 tbsp fish oil—122</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #5</h4><ul> <li>8 oz steak</li>    <li>12 oz baked potato</li>    <li>spinach salad</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #6</h4><ul> <li>10 oz cod</li>    <li>2 cups rice</li>    <li>salad</li> </ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meal #7</h4><ul> <li>30 grams casein protein</li>    <li>10 egg-white omelet</li>    <li>1 cup veggies (onions, peppers, mushrooms)</li>    <li>1 tbsp omega-3 fish oil</li> </ul><figure><img title="Provided by Man of Many US" src="IMG/AA1jVQk6_close_up_of_dwayne_the_rock_johnson.jpg" alt="Close up of Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson"><figcaption><em>The Rock Workout Plan | Image: Under Armour. Provided by Man of Many US</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Rock Workout Plan</h2><p>Are you ready to bring out your inner Hercules? The Rock workout plan will certainly get you there, but don’t think for a second that the journey will be easy. On the contrary, The Rock workout routine is pretty much as demanding as modern fitness can get. Of course, should you properly execute this brutal training regimen, you’ll be walking tall like a one-man gun show (who out there got the reference?).</p><p>Depending on the type of role he’s training for, The Rock employs varying levels of intensity. That said, his workout routine is always pretty intense. It kicks off with 30-50 minutes of cardio on the elliptical cross trainer first thing in the morning. After that, he eats a hearty, protein-packed breakfast.</p><p>Then it’s off to the gym, where the real workout begins. In The Rock’s own words, he gets “busy with a nice session of clangin’ and bangin’—epic pain, epic results.” That means lifting heavy weights on a regular basis, working out six days a week, and focusing on a different muscle group each day. All the while, The Rock is cranking his ultimate music playlist, presumably on his namesake headphones or earbuds. On the seventh day, he rests…and eats gobs of ice cream (if his legendary Instagram feed is anything to go by).</p><p>Before we dive into the basics, a simple reminder: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is 6 foot 5 and built like a truck. We only mention this because we would never want you to bite off more than you can chew by eating everything he eats and lifting everything he lifts. In other words, apply a little common sense when adopting The Rock’s workout routine, so that we don’t end up with a lawsuit on our hands. Intensity is good. Overdoing it, bad.</p><p>Now that we’ve gotten our little disclaimer out of the way, we present one of The Rock’s ultimate workout plans. Prepare to get busy with the kettlebells, barbells, and dumbbells exercises. Your triceps will be sore, your legs with be sore, and everything will be sore, but it will be worth it in the long run. Epic pain, epic results, as the man himself likes to say. Without further delay, here is The Rock’s workout plan:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Day 1: Legs</h3><ul> <li>Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes</li>    <li>Eat Breakfast</li>    <li>Barbell Walking Lunge – 4 sets, 25 reps</li>    <li>Leg Press – 4 sets, 25 reps</li>    <li>Leg Extensions – 3 sets, 20 reps</li>    <li>Barbell Squat – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Hack Squat – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Single Leg Hack Squat – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Romanian Deadlift – 4 sets, 10 reps</li>    <li>Seated Leg Curl – 3 sets, 20 reps</li>    <li>Thigh Abductor – 4 sets, 12 reps</li> </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Day 2: Back</h3><ul> <li>Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes</li>    <li>Eat Breakfast</li>    <li>Wide-Grip Lat Pulldown – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Bent Over Barbell Row – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>One-Arm Dumbbell Row – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Barbell Deadlift – 3 sets, 10 reps</li>    <li>Pull-ups – 3 sets, to failure</li>    <li>Dumbbell Shrug – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Inverted Row – 3 sets, to failure</li>    <li>Hyperextensions (Back) – 4 sets, 12 reps</li> </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Day 3: Shoulders</h3><ul> <li>Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes</li>    <li>Eat Breakfast</li>    <li>Dumbbell Shoulder Press – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Standing Military Press – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Front Dumbbell Raise – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Side Lateral Raise – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Reverse Machine Flyes – 4 sets, 15 reps</li>    <li>Seated Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise – 4 sets, 12 reps</li> </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Day 4: Arms/Abs</h3><ul> <li>Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes</li>    <li>Eat Breakfast</li>    <li>Dumbbell Bicep Curl – 4 sets, 15 reps</li>    <li>Hammer Curls – 4 sets, 15 reps</li>    <li>Spider Curl – 4 sets, to failure</li>    <li>Triceps Pushdown – 4 sets, 15 reps</li>    <li>Overhead Triceps – 3 sets, 15 reps</li>    <li>Hanging Leg Raise – 4 sets, 20 reps</li>    <li>Rope Crunch – 4 sets, 20 reps</li>    <li>Russian Twist – 4 sets, 20 reps</li> </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Day 5: Legs</h3><ul> <li>Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes</li>    <li>Eat Breakfast</li>    <li>Barbell Walking Lunge – 4 sets, 25 reps</li>    <li>Leg Press – 4 sets, 25 reps</li>    <li>Leg Extensions – 3 sets, 20 reps</li>    <li>Barbell Squat – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Hack Squat – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Single Leg Hack Squat – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Romanian Deadlift – 4 sets, 10 reps</li>    <li>Seated Leg Curl – 3 sets, 20 reps</li>    <li>Thigh Abductor – 4 sets, 12 reps</li> </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Day 6: Chest</h3><ul> <li>Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes</li>    <li>Barbell Bench Press – Medium Grip – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Incline Dumbbell Press – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Dumbbell Bench Press – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Flat Bench Cable Flyes – 4 sets, to failure</li>    <li>Incline Hammer Curls – 4 sets, 12 reps</li>    <li>Dips – Chest Version – 4 sets, to failure</li> </ul><ul> <li>Eat Ice Cream Sandwiches</li> </ul><p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>You’ll also like:</strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Diet and Workout Plan</p><p>Zac Efron’s ‘Baywatch’ Diet and Workout Plan</p><p>Chris Hemsworth’s Thor Diet & Workout Plan</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Rock Workout FAQ</h2><strong class="schema-faq-question">Does The Rock workout on an empty stomach? </strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">Johnson stated that he starts every day with a cardio workout on an empty stomach, but then eats six to seven meals throughout the rest of the day. </p><strong class="schema-faq-question">How many hours does The Rock sleep?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">Johnson typically wakes up at 3:30am, and he is one of those uncommon individuals who require very little sleep.
