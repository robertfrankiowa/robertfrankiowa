    <main><h1>How working out at home can save you $700 a year</h1><p>We all know that we need to squeeze in at least 30 minutes of activity a day, but with our busy schedules, that’s not always possible. From the soaring costs of gym memberships, to the actual time you spend commuting to and from your workout spot – a number of factors can work against you when trying to instil a consistent workout regimen. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Find a space for you home workout</strong></h2><p>Before diving right into a home workout, start by finding the perfect space in your home. Is it in the living room so you can play music or videos from your TV? Or is it in your backyard so you can soak up some Vitamin D whilst working out? </p><p>The space where you exercise will need to be big enough for you to spread out, stretch and move around. Depending on what kind of fitness you’ll be doing, you may need to consider what surface you’re working with. HIIT workouts may require a more solid surface like tiles or wooden flooring, whereas yoga and Pilates can be done on softer surfaces like grass and carpet.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yoga and Pilates</strong></h2><p>Yoga and Pilates can be done from home, even if you’re a beginner. Even though in a dedicated yoga or Pilates studio, you’ll find an abundance of fancy equipment, when you’re doing it from home you’ll only need the basics. The first step is to invest in a good mat, a block and straps for your at-home yoga or Pilates workout. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Australian Women's Weekly" src="IMG/BB1hPCDH_home_workout.jpg" alt="home workout"><figcaption><em>home workout.

You can buy a book and create a flow from movements you find within the book. Alternatively, you can find a number of online websites that will give you a step-by-step guide on how to do the moves. </p><p>If you’re someone who enjoys the feel of following an instructor, YouTube has thousands upon thousands of free, guided yoga and Pilates sessions. The beauty of this is, there’s a choice for every mood, whether you’re looking for a rigorous workout or a pre-bedtime ritual. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strength training</strong></h2><p>Depending on your budget, you can do strength training at home with or without equipment. For a strength training home workout, you can invest in equipment such as a set of weights, a medicine ball, kettlebells and other training aids. However, you can still do strength training without having to purchase a tonne of equipment.</p><p>Once you’ve decided whether or not to invest in home workout equipment, you will need to decide whether your workout will focus on the upper body, lower body or core. Here’s some examples of at-home strength training exercises.</p><ul> <li><strong>Dumbbell squats:</strong> This will focus on your legs and glutes. Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand, lower your body as if sitting in a chair. Keep your back straight and chest up, then return to a standing position. This can also be just as effective without dumbbells.</li>    <li><strong>Pushups:</strong> Get into the plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, then lower yourself up and down. For an extra push, try adding a resistance band around your back and looping through your thumbs.</li>    <li><strong>Kettlebell swings: </strong>Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold a kettlebell with both hands. Then, drive your hips forward, allowing the kettlebell to swing back between your legs, then reverse this motion so the kettlebell reaches chest height.</li>    <li><strong>Wall sits:</strong> This is a great core workout you can do at home with no equipment. Simply find a wall, position your back against it with your feet shoulder-width apart. Then slide down until your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle – as if you were sitting on a chair. Hold for 20-30 seconds or longer.</li> </ul><figure><img title="Provided by Australian Women's Weekly" src="IMG/BB1hPxN9_how_working_out_at_home_can_save_you_700_a_year.jpg" alt="How working out at home can save you $700 a year"><figcaption><em>.

This can look like jump roping, kickboxing or running stairs. Alternatively, YouTube is filled with guided cardio workouts you can do from the comfort of your living room. If you’re someone who loves to bust a move, there are guided dance workouts available too.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HIIT</strong></h2><p>High Intensity Interval Training, or HIIT for short, is hailed as the ultimate time efficient workout as it typically requires less time than a traditional workout regime. Here are some HIIT workouts that can be done at home:</p></main>
