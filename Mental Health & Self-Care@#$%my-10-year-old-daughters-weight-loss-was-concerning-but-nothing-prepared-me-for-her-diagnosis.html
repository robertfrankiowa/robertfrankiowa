    <main><h1>My 10-Year-Old Daughter's Weight Loss Was Concerning, But Nothing Prepared Me for Her Diagnosis</h1><p>               </p><p>Stacey Mullins' life has changed in unimaginable ways in the last two years. Her 10-year-old daughter, Averi, transitioned from being a healthy, active child to fighting for her life almost overnight. Averi's sudden weight loss and increased thirst were the first signs that something was wrong, but the reality of her diagnosis was far more shocking.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Initial Signs and Symptoms</h2><p>During a weekend visit with her father, Averi's stepmother noticed that she had been drinking more water than usual. While this was unusual, it wasn't immediately alarming. A few days later, Averi started getting extremely tired, prompting Stacey to keep her home from school and call their pediatrician. During the visit, her blood sugar was found to be dangerously high, leading to her immediate admission to the local Children's Hospital. Within minutes, Averi was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Missed Warning Signs</h2><p>Reflecting on the period before Averi's diagnosis, Stacey realized there were several signs she had missed. Averi had been moody, constantly hungry, and losing weight. On the day of her diagnosis, Stacey felt a deep sense of guilt for not recognizing these symptoms sooner. As a parent, she prided herself on being vigilant, but this situation made her question her attentiveness.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Overwhelming Learning Curve</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Secret Life of Mom" src="IMG/BB1pRBkL_insulin_and_blood_sugar_reader.jpg" alt="insulin and blood sugar reader"><figcaption><em>Credit : Pexels.

They underwent intensive diabetes training and education, learning to monitor Averi's glucose levels and administer insulin. Stacey described it as feeling similar to bringing a newborn home-no rule book, just hope and determination to manage her daughter's condition effectively.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on Mental Health</h2><p>After Averi's discharge, Stacey's mental health deteriorated. She was sleep-deprived, anxious, and overwhelmed by the lack of control over Averi's condition. Additionally, she was dealing with her chronic illness, ulcerative colitis, which had worsened over the years, requiring multiple surgeries.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Balancing Personal Health and Caregiving</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Secret Life of Mom" src="IMG/BB1pRI8d_mother_and_daughter_walking_on_the_beach_at_sunset.jpg" alt="mother and daughter walking on the beach at sunset"><figcaption><em>Credit : Pixabay.

Despite contemplating canceling the procedure, Stacey realized that prioritizing her health was essential to being there for Averi. She proceeded with the surgery, understanding that it was a decision made for both their futures.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Transition to Insulin Pump</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Secret Life of Mom" src="IMG/BB1pRFAo_young_girl_with_insulin_pump.jpg" alt="young girl with insulin pump"><figcaption><em>Credit : Pexels.

After a frightening episode of low blood sugar, they transitioned Averi to an insulin pump, which auto-adjusts her insulin levels every five minutes. This change significantly improved Averi's quality of life, allowing her more independence and giving Stacey the time to care for herself.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Message of Resilience and Self-Care</h2><p>Averi is now 12 years old and is the embodiment of resilience and courage. Watching her navigate life's challenges with grace has been incredibly inspiring for Stacey. According to the CDC, 129 million people in the U.S. suffer from chronic illnesses, and it's likely that someone you know may be affected. If a child is diagnosed with a chronic illness, it's important for parents to breathe, lean on their support system, and take care of themselves. “You can’t pour into anyone else’s cup when yours is empty,” says Stacey.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Secret Life of Mom" src="IMG/BB1pRyUb_mother_and_daughter_on_a_park_bench_holding_hands.jpg" alt="mother and daughter on a park bench holding hands"><figcaption><em>Credit : Pixabay. Provided by Secret Life of Mom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Averi's journey has taught Stacey the importance of vigilance, resilience, and self-care. Averi's strength inspires her daily, and their experience underscores the critical need for early recognition of symptoms and proactive health management. Through this journey, they have found a new normal, balancing Averi's care with maintaining their well-being.</p><p><em>H/t Newsweek</em></p></main>
