    <main><h1>Why the Beach Is Good for Your Mental Health</h1><p>When the sun is out and warm weather is in the forecast, heading to the beach is a no-brainer for most.</p><p>But, what makes the beach such an excellent place for mental health? Three words—water, sun, and air. All of these natural elements offer some form of mental health benefits that helps the mind relax and allow the opportunity for social gathering.</p><h2>Being Near Crisp Blue Water Can Improve Your Overall Health </h2><p>Being near blue bodies of water like oceans, pools, rivers, lakes, and ponds can potentially provide various mental and physical health benefits such as:</p><ul><li>Improved relaxation</li><li>Better social interactions</li><li>A boost in brain health</li><li>Enhanced physical activity</li></ul><p>Because of the many benefits of being near water, health practitioners are beginning to recommend getting near (or going in) bodies of water to improve your overall well-being.</p><h2>Vitamin D From the Sun Can Help Boost Your Mood</h2><p>Experts have found moderate sunlight to positively influence mental well-being. The sun can help increase serotonin levels, a neurotransmitter involved in mood functioning. That big yellow star also helps us make vitamin D, which can be important to our mood.</p><p>Additionally, vitamin D helps maintain bone health and a robust immune system.</p><p><h3>Don't Stay Out in the Sun for Too Long Though!</h3><p>Of course, too much sun can adversely affect the body and skin,but as long as measures are taken to protect the skin (by slathering on some sunscreen), a few hours at the beach can be just the right amount of sun you need to reap benefits. </p><p> <h2>Fresh Air Is Always a Good Thing</h2><p>Fresh air is generally beneficial to both the mind and body. Researchers discovered that participating in outdoor activities has a more significant impact on mental health than doing those activities indoors.</p><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Another research study surveyed university students, and many individuals indicated nature and leisure time to be vital contributors to their well-being and health. It was found that being in nature makes them feel happy thus allowing people to associate nature with positive feelings like tranquility, peace, relaxation, and ease.</p><p> <p>Even doing the simplest of acts outside can make you feel good. By taking a deep breath or putting aside some time for a quick jog, you can reap nature’s benefits.</p><p>Maybe even grab your yoga mat and do your usual meditation outside, or grab your work laptop and work outside for a nice change of scenery.</p><h2>Relaxing On the Beach Helps You Destress</h2><p>The beach provides a space for both children and adults to be physically active while being in nature but primarily allows the opportunity to destress and have fun. Interestingly enough, research actually backs this up!</p><p><p>The ability to relax and set aside other tasks for a few hours is one of the reasons people look forward to going to the beach.</p><p> <p>A study showed that people experience a number of health benefits by taking a trip to the beach. When you're at the beach running around in the sand or going for a swim, your brain gets the chance to destress because you're having fun and engaging with nature.</p><h2>You Can Practice Mindfulness at the Beach</h2><p>The beach is a great place to practice mindfulness. Approaches to mindfulness include listening to the ocean’s waves, or the laughter of others, feeling the breeze of the wind or the coarse sand on your toes, and water and sun on your skin.</p><p>You can also admire the beach’s scenic view as the ocean water meets the blue sky. </p><h2>It's the Perfect Place to Bond With Other People</h2><p>There are a lot of sporting activities you can participate in at the beach. Whether you're a skilled player or not, you can definitely join in on a game of volleyball, football, soccer, rugby, or kickball, while you're at the beach. Engaging in these sports gives you time to interact and bond with others—and maybe even make some new friends.</p><p><p>Whether your goal is to work on your tan, feel the sand between your toes, or take a dip into the cool ocean water, the beach can find a way to put a smile on your face. Enjoying all of this with loved ones makes this experience even more remarkable. So, if you are looking for some time outdoors and a little mood boost, consider a trip (or two) to the beach. </p></main>
