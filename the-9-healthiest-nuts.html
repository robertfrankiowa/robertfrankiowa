They contain protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are also rich in unsaturated fats, which are considered "good" fats.</p><p>Consuming nuts as part of a well-balanced diet can offer health benefits, such as promoting weight loss, lowering your risk for heart disease, improving digestion, supporting your immune system, and more.</p><p>This article discusses the healthiest nuts, their benefits, and how many you should consume.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1osMJg_a_woman_pouring_mixed_nuts_into_her_hand.jpg" alt="A woman pouring mixed nuts into her hand"><figcaption><em>eternalcreative / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>What Are the Healthiest Nuts?</h2><p>While all nuts are generally healthy, some offer more specific benefits than others. Some of the most nutritious nuts include:</p><ol><li><strong>Almonds</strong>: They are particularly rich in vitamin E.</li><li><strong>Pistachios</strong>: These small, green nuts provide a variety of nutrients, such as vitamin B6 and antioxidants. They are also slightly lower in calories compared to other nuts.</li><li><strong>Walnuts</strong>: They are known for their high levels of copper, manganese, and omega-3 fatty acids.</li><li><strong>Cashews</strong>: Native to South America, they provide vitamin K, magnesium, and manganese. </li><li><strong>Pecans:</strong> Native to North America, these nuts are a good source of zinc and manganese.</li><li><strong>Macadamia nuts</strong>: High in healthy fats and low in carbs, these nuts also provide vitamin B1, copper, and manganese.</li><li><strong>Brazil nuts</strong>: These large nuts come from the Amazon rainforest and are particularly high in selenium, a mineral needed for thyroid health.</li><li><strong>Hazelnuts</strong>: They are a good source of vitamin E, manganese, and antioxidants.</li><li><strong>Peanuts</strong>: Although technically legumes, they have a nutritional profile similar to nuts. Peanuts provide folate, which is especially important for pregnant people. </li></ol><h2>Nuts Are a Great Source of Many Nutrients</h2><p>Nuts contain all three primary macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and protein. They are also a good source of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) your body needs in small amounts.</p><p>One cup of mixed nuts contains the following:</p><ul><li>Calories: 813</li><li>Protein: 23.7 grams (g)</li><li>Fiber: 12.33 g</li><li>Magnesium: 308.25 milligrams (mg)</li><li>Phosphorus: 595.95 mg</li><li>Potassium: 817.89 mg</li><li>Zinc: 5.21 mg</li><li>Copper: 1.75 mg</li><li>Manganese: 2.65 mg</li><li>Vitamin E: 15 mg</li><li>Folate: 68.5 micrograms (mcg)</li></ul><h2>Health Benefits of Nuts</h2><p>Consuming nuts may help improve your overall health. You might feel better and have more energy when you eat a healthy diet that includes nuts. Research also shows that nuts can offer specific health benefits for some people.</p><h3>Reduced Disease Risk</h3><p>Nuts contain antioxidants, which may fight off cell damage that triggers certain diseases. Some research suggests that eating peanuts or tree nuts may help reduce the risk of colorectal, endometrial, and pancreatic cancer. People who consumed more nuts had a 19% lower risk of dying prematurely from any cause.</p><h3>May Aid Weight Loss</h3><p>Though they are high in fat, nuts may promote weight loss. One study analyzed the lifestyle habits of more than 373,000 participants. Researchers found that people who included nuts in their diets gained less weight during the study period. The nut eaters also had a 5% lower risk of becoming overweight or obese. Some experts believe that because nuts contain a lot of fiber, they may keep you full longer, which can lessen cravings.</p><h3>May Lower Cholesterol and Triglycerides</h3><p>Nuts are known to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which may protect your heart. The cholesterol-lowering effects are likely due to the high content of the nut's monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Research has found most nuts, including almonds, walnuts, cashews, peanuts, and pistachios, may help decrease total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.</p><h3>Helps Manage Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome</h3><p>Research suggests that nuts may be a good option for managing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. They are naturally low in carbs, so they won’t significantly raise blood sugar levels. Experts consider nuts as a diabetes superfood.</p><h3>May Reduce Inflammation</h3><p>Nuts contain compounds that may reduce inflammation linked to various diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis. In a study, people who followed the Mediterranean diet and consumed nuts experienced decreased inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).</p><p>Some studies suggest that nuts may help promote gut health. The fiber in nuts functions as a prebiotic, which helps balance gut bacteria. Additionally, nuts contain polyphenols, which could boost gut health.</p><p>One review found that eating more nuts was linked to a 24% lower risk of heart disease and an 18% lower risk of stroke mortality. Researchers believe consuming nuts has a positive impact on preventing cardiovascular diseases.</p><h2>Are Nut Oils and Butters Healthy Too?</h2><p>Nut butters often contain many of the same healthy vitamins, minerals, and fats as nuts. Some popular types of nut butter include peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, and walnut butter. When choosing a nut butter, it is important to look for a product without added ingredients such as sugar, salt, or hydrogenated oils.</p><p>Nut oils (peanut, almond, and walnut) are also a good source of nutrients but may not provide the same amount of fiber in whole nuts.</p><h2>How Many Nuts Should I Eat? </h2><p>While nuts are a healthy food option, they are also high in calories. You can eat nuts daily, but it’s important not to overdo it. Experts recommend one serving of nuts (about 1 ounce), equivalent to a small handful.</p><h2>Who Should Avoid Eating Nuts?</h2><p>Nuts are a healthy option for most people, but you may want to avoid them if you:</p><ul><li>Are allergic to nuts</li><li>Take certain medications, such as antibiotics, laxatives, or blood pressure drugs</li><li>Take vitamin E supplements</li><li>Have difficulty swallowing</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Nuts are a tasty and healthy food option for most people. They contain many nutrients that can improve overall health, aid in weight loss, improve gut health, and reduce your risk of developing certain diseases. However, it’s important to consume nuts in moderation. Just a small handful of nuts each day is enough to reap the health benefits.  </p></main>
