    <title>Natural Ways to Reduce Uric Acid in the Body</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Most people don't think about their uric acid levels. It's rare for them to become too low, but high levels could cause gout, kidney disease, inflammation, and other health issues. Uric acid is a natural waste product the body makes while digesting foods with a chemical called purines. Purine-rich foods include red meat, sardines, and […] The post Natural Ways to Reduce Uric Acid in the Body appeared first on The Hearty Soul.">

    <main><h1>Natural Ways to Reduce Uric Acid in the Body</h1><h2>How to Reduce Uric Levels in the Body</h2><p>What steps can be taken to reduce uric acid levels in the body? What foods should we avoid in order to achieve optimum uric acid levels? </p><h2>Eat Fewer Foods With High Levels of Purine</h2><p>When digested, these kinds of food lead to higher uric acid in the body. Therefore, limiting these kinds of products, including red meat, high-purine seafood, and organ meats, is advisable. Although some vegetables are rich in purine, a study from 2020 found that reducing consumption of them may not impact uric acid levels.</p><figure><img title="Eat Fewer Foods With High Levels of Purine" src="IMG/BB1oHhGc_eat_fewer_foods_with_high_levels_of_purine.jpg" alt="Eat Fewer Foods With High Levels of Purine"><figcaption><em>Eat Fewer Foods With High Levels of Purine.

Sugar comes in many forms like granulated sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and many more. To reduce the amount of sugar in your diet, check food labels to assess their sugar content - you may be surprised how many products have sweeteners snuck into them. At the same time, limit processed and packaged foods and opt to eat more whole foods. Swap desserts and sweet snacks for fresh fruit. Additionally, replace sugary drinks and fruit juices with sparkling water, unsweetened teas, and coffees. Sugars in beverages are absorbed faster than foods, resulting in spiked blood sugar levels and higher amounts of uric acids.</p><figure><img title="Avoid Sugar" src="IMG/BB1oHf6i_avoid_sugar.jpg" alt="Avoid Sugar"><figcaption><em>Avoid Sugar.

Meanwhile, avoid drinking alcohol that could dehydrate you and cause high uric acid levels. Even worse, some alcoholic drinks, namely beer, contain high amounts of purine, although all types of alcohol can heighten the body's production of purine. </p><p>At the same time, coffee may help reduce uric acid levels by making the body excrete it more quickly and lowering the uric acid production rate. However, some studies suggest that coffee doesn't have any impact, and more research is needed to confirm one way or the other. </p><figure><img title="Watch What You Drink" src="IMG/BB1oH3Zk_watch_what_you_drink.jpg" alt="Watch What You Drink"><figcaption><em>Watch What You Drink.

It's always best to attain these nutrients through foods rather than supplements. A healthy diet rich in produce will also yield more health benefits. </p><h2>Manage Obesity and Blood Sugar Levels</h2><p>Unfortunately, hyperuricemia has been linked to the development of diabetes. Also, people with high blood sugar have a heightened risk of developing hyperuricemia and its consequences. Therefore, it's important to check blood sugar levels during routine checkups, even for people who don't have diabetes or pre-diabetes. Similarly, obesity could also contribute to increased production of uric acid levels and retain them instead of properly excreting them through the urine. People who are overweight and are concerned about hyperuricemia should speak to their healthcare practitioner to create a healthy and sustainable weight loss plan. </p><figure><img title="Manage Obesity and Blood Sugar Levels" src="IMG/BB1oH8d3_manage_obesity_and_blood_sugar_levels.jpg" alt="Manage Obesity and Blood Sugar Levels"><figcaption><em>Manage Obesity and Blood Sugar Levels.

Speak to your healthcare practitioner if you have hyperuricemia, and take anything on this list to find a better alternative. Do not go off of your medication or make adjustments without professional guidance.</p></main>
