Researchers developed it specifically to preserve cognitive function, Maggie Moon, MS, RD, brain health nutrition specialist and best-selling author of The MIND Diet, told <em>Health</em>. Dementia affects about 10% of U.S. adults age 65 and over, and experts have identified diet as one of the factors that may protect against cognitive decline.  </p><p>According to Moon, the MIND diet emphasizes eating healthy portions of vegetables (both leafy and non-leafy), nuts, beans, berries, lean poultry, fish, and whole grains. People following the diet should also use olive oil as their added fat and drink wine in moderation. The diet limits the intake of red meat, butter, full-fat cheese, fried fast food, and sweets. </p><p>Moon noted that the MIND diet has been associated with improvements in various aspects of aging, including improved grip strength, mobility, and “inflammaging,” a term for chronic low-grade inflammation. Previous research has also shown that following the diet may slow brain aging by up to 7.5 years.</p><p>The new study strengthens the link between the MIND diet and brain health and explains why the eating plan may help preserve cognitive function.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1lhHN0_woman_eating_healthy_meal.jpg" alt="woman eating healthy meal"><figcaption><em>Kseniya Ovchinnikova / Getty Images.

They pulled data on 1,644 dementia-free adults aged 60 and older who were part of the study’s second generation. </p><p>Between 1991 and 2008, researchers checked in with participants every four to seven years to take blood and assess factors such as diet and results from neurocognitive tests. In total, 140 participants developed dementia during that timeframe.</p><p>To determine the pace of aging, the scientists used an “epigenetic clock” called DunedinPACE, which examines DNA methylation patterns.</p><p>Results showed an association between greater compliance to the MIND diet and a slower pace of aging, as well as lower odds of developing dementia and dying. The scientists found that a slower DunedinPACE accounted for 27% of the association between diet and dementia and 57% of the relationship between diet and mortality.</p><p>Study author Dan Belsky, PhD, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said that the findings strengthen support for recommending the MIND diet to boost brain health. However, he noted that it’s difficult to generalize the conclusions because all study participants lived in a single town in Massachusetts.</p><p>“Replication of findings in studies representing other groups within the U.S. population are needed,” he said.</p><p>Belsky, who helped create DunedinPACE, also noted that it’s impossible to know how accurate the measuring device is because “there is no gold standard measure of the pace of aging.”</p><h2>Why Does the MIND Diet Support Brain Health?</h2><p>While scientists are still untangling how a healthy diet might lower dementia risk, research has shed light on how some ingredients in MIND diet foods may affect the brain.</p><p>“We think one of the key mechanisms at play are the omega-3 fatty acids from foods like walnuts and arctic char, for example, which calm the inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain that can lead to memory and cognition problems,” Moon said.</p><p>Another reason the MIND diet likely works, Moon added, is the high concentration of polyphenols and antioxidants in colorful foods like berries, leafy greens, broccoli, and black beans. These compounds neutralize free radicals, molecules that can harm cells. They also create an unfriendly environment for amyloid formation, considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h2>Who Should Follow the MIND Diet?</h2><p>The foods included in the MIND diet are rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein and pose little risk for anyone who chooses to follow the plan.</p><p>However, most of the research into brain health support has involved adults aged 60 years and older, showing potential benefits for this population.</p><p>But that isn’t to say that eating a diet full of walnuts, avocados, fish, and other nutrient-dense foods doesn’t offer benefits for younger people as well.</p><p>Moon said the MIND diet is not just about dementia prevention. It’s also associated with a reduced risk of stroke, type 2 diabetes, stress, and anxiety, and may lower high blood pressure and improve insulin sensitivity.</p><p>So, even if you’re not worried about your risk of dementia, it may still be worth implementing the MIND diet for the potential to reap benefits that extend far beyond a dose of brain power.</p>
