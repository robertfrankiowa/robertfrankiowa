    <main><h1>Types Of Tularemia And Their Symptoms</h1><h2>Ulceroglandular Tularemia</h2><p>Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common form of tularemia, and it is normally transmitted through a bite from an infected tick, mosquito, or deer fly. Individuals who have handled infected animals may also develop this type of tularemia. Ulcers, one of the defining features of this form of the condition, typically appear on the skin at the site where the bacteria enters the body, and some patients may have a rash at the infection site. In addition, lymph nodes near the ulcer will become swollen and painful, and this often occurs in the lymph nodes of the groin or armpits. Some patients may experience chills, headaches, joint pain, a sore throat, and diarrhea with this type of tularemia. Many patients also feel very fatigued with this infection. The ulcers and skin rashes associated with this form of the disease may need to be dressed and treated with medication to prevent blistering, and doctors will carefully monitor swollen lymph nodes to make sure they resolve.</p><p>Keep reading to learn more about the different types of tularemia now.</p><figure><img title="Ulceroglandular Tularemia" src="IMG/AA1nED3S_ulceroglandular_tularemia.jpg" alt="Ulceroglandular Tularemia"><figcaption><em>Ulceroglandular Tularemia.  HuffingtonPost </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Oculoglandular Tularemia</h2><p>This form of tularemia occurs when the <em>Francisella tularensis</em> bacterium enters the body through the eyes. Patients may contract this type of tularemia if they touch their eyes while handling or butchering an animal infected with the bacterium. Transmission may also take place if a drop of blood from an infected organism enters the eye through splashing. Symptoms that can occur with oculoglandular tularemia include eye pain, sensitivity to light, redness of the eyes, and discharge from the eyes. Some patients may also develop swelling of the eyes, and an ulcer could form on the inside of the eyelid. The lymph nodes around the ear, neck, and jaw may become swollen and tender too. To prevent oculoglandular tularemia, experts advise individuals to wear gloves and protective eyewear when handling animals that could carry <em>Francisella tularensis</em>.</p><p>Uncover more types of tularemia now.</p><figure><img title="Oculoglandular Tularemia" src="IMG/AA1nxnfi_oculoglandular_tularemia.jpg" alt="Oculoglandular Tularemia"><figcaption><em>Oculoglandular Tularemia.

It is most often transmitted through eating undercooked meat from infected animals or through drinking contaminated water. The most frequent route of transmission for this type of the disease is eating rabbit meat. Patients with oropharyngeal tularemia typically experience a sore throat and mouth ulcers, and these may be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. The lymph nodes in the neck usually swell, and the tonsils might also become inflamed. In the later stages, diarrhea and abdominal pain could develop. If oropharyngeal tularemia advances without treatment, it may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. To reduce the risk of this form of tularemia, researchers recommend cooking all meat, including wild game, to a minimum temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. This cooking temperature is sufficient to kill <em>Francisella tularensis</em>.</p><p>Get the details on the next type of tularemia now.</p><figure><img title="Oropharyngeal Tularemia" src="IMG/BB1mcCOD_oropharyngeal_tularemia.jpg" alt="Oropharyngeal Tularemia"><figcaption><em>Oropharyngeal Tularemia.  CMAJ </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Pneumonic Tularemia</h2><p>Pneumonic tularemia involves the lungs, and it is transmitted when an individual inhales <em>Francisella tularensis</em>bacteria that has become airborne. Although among the rarest types of this condition, it is also one of the most severe forms of tularemia for humans. Patients are at risk of contracting this variety of tularemia when they do gardening, construction work, or other activities that disturb the soil. Laboratory workers who work with this disease are at an increased risk of pneumonic tularemia, and the condition can develop when other less serious forms of tularemia are left untreated. The symptoms associated with pneumonic tularemia are similar to pneumonia and include chest pain, a dry cough, and breathing difficulties. As this condition progresses, patients might develop a lung abscess or pleural effusion (an accumulation of fluid around the lungs). This form of tularemia may require the use of intravenous antibiotics, and patients will need to be closely monitored for potential complications such as pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane that protects the heart). To reduce their risk of pneumonic tularemia, lab workers and individuals who garden or work with soil should wear face masks.</p><p>Learn more about the various forms of tularemia now.</p><figure><img title="Pneumonic Tularemia" src="IMG/AA1nIaBz_pneumonic_tularemia.jpg" alt="Pneumonic Tularemia"><figcaption><em>Pneumonic Tularemia.

The method of transmission for this variety is currently unknown, but scientists believe it is most likely acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or drink. Pneumonia is one of the major symptoms associated with typhoidal tularemia, and this form is known to cause especially high fevers. Patients may also have diarrhea, vomiting, and severe fatigue, and some individuals will experience enlargement of the spleen or liver. As the most serious form of tularemia, this type is associated with severe complications, including hepatitis (an inflammation of the liver), sepsis (a blood infection), and osteomyelitis (bone infections).</p></main>
