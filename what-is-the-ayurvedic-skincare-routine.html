Not sure where to begin? Try out the Ayurvedic skincare routine!</p><p>Ayurveda, an ancient holistic healing system from India, has been gaining popularity in the beauty industry for its natural and effective approach to skincare. With a focus on balancing the mind, body, and spirit, Ayurvedic skincare offers a more personalized and holistic approach to beauty. This is what you need to know.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Ayurveda?</h2><p>Ayurveda, originating over 3,000 years ago in India, is a holistic medical system based on restoring balance and life. It revolves around the concept of three doshas, or life forces, derived from five elements, shaping each individual’s physical and mental constitution.</p><p>Disease occurs when there’s an imbalance in the doshas. This imbalance is caused by lifestyle, diet, stress, exercise, and pollution, which affect the body’s activities and lead to disease.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oa7W2_ayurvedic_skincare.jpg" alt="Ayurvedic skincare"><figcaption><em>© Chinh Le Duc / Unsplash. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ayurvedic treatments include purification, herbal remedies, diet, yoga, meditation, and massage to rejuvenate the life force, aiming to facilitate toxin removal, reduce stress, enhance disease resistance, and restore overall balance and harmony to the body.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Aryuvedic Skincare?</h2><p>Ayurvedic skincare is based on three pillars:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Roopam</h3><p>Ayurvedic treatments not only focus on inner balance but also emphasize outer beauty, known as “Roopam,” which encompasses features like shining, healthy hair and a clear, radiant complexion. These treatments aim to enhance both inner vitality and outer appearance, promoting holistic well-being.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Gunam</h3><p>Ayurvedic practices also seek to nurture “Gunam,” which represents inner beauty, emanating from a warm, pleasing personality and innocence of mind and heart. By fostering mental and emotional balance alongside physical health, Ayurveda promotes a holistic approach to beauty and wellness, aiming to cultivate both inner and outer radiance.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oa2DP_ayurveda.jpg" alt="ayurveda"><figcaption><em>© Katherine Hanlon / Unsplash.

It relates to lasting beauty and the ability to look and feel younger than one’s chronological age. Through comprehensive lifestyle practices, dietary adjustments, and holistic treatments, Ayurveda aims to promote longevity, vitality, and graceful aging, fostering a sense of youthfulness that transcends mere physical appearance.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Three Doshas</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Kapha</h3><p>Kapha, representing cohesion and stability, supports the body’s structure from cells to muscles, bones, and ligaments and is known for its endurance and lubrication. Dominant in Kapha individuals often prefer routine and value loyalty and nurturing qualities</p><p> However, imbalanced kapha can lead to issues like fatigue, weight gain, and emotional attachment. Ayurvedic approaches to rebalance kapha may involve the use of essential oils.</p><p>It also includes opting for lighter foods like fruits and vegetables in smaller portions and increasing physical activity to promote circulation.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Vata</h3><p>According to Ayurveda philosophy, vata governs the movement in the body and mind, including flexibility, muscle and joint movement, blood flow, and breathing. If Vata dominates, one may be creative and quick to action, but may also experience anxiety or worry.</p><p>Ayurvedic recommendations for excessive vata may include grounding techniques such as maintaining a regular sleep and eating schedule, meditation, rest, and relaxation.</p><p>Pitta, often associated with “fire” in Ayurveda, governs digestion, hormones, and metabolism. Individuals dominant in pitta tend to exhibit leadership qualities, competitiveness, confidence, and focus.</p><p>However, imbalanced pitta may lead to anger, rash decisions, or self-destructive behavior, along with inflammation, skin conditions, and digestive issues.</p><p>Ayurvedic approaches to balance pitta include engaging in cool, calming activities. It is also suggested to consume cooler foods or a Mediterranean diet to alleviate inflammation.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oacjk_ayurvedic_skincare.jpg" alt="Ayurvedic skincare"><figcaption><em>© Chelsea shapouri / Unsplash. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are the Components of Ayurvedic Skincare?</h2><p>Ayurveda emphasizes that proper nutrition, efficient digestion, assimilation of nutrients, and regular elimination are essential for a radiant, clear complexion. They expand on the saying “<em>you are what you eat”</em> to include “<em>you are what you digest.”</em></p><p>The main beliefs include:</p><ul> <li>Consume your largest meal at midday when your digestive fire is strongest, stopping when pleasantly satisfied but not full.</li>    <li>Prioritize pure, organic foods to prevent toxin buildup and skin issues. Incorporate ghee, whole grains, ginger, turmeric, black pepper, legumes, green leafy vegetables, and herbal tea for their anti-aging and skin-strengthening properties.</li>    <li>Stay hydrated throughout the day, favoring warm water to support digestion and skin health by flushing out toxins.</li>    <li>Avoid distractions during meals and opt for warm beverages over ice-cold ones to support digestion.</li>    <li>Follow Ayurvedic dietary recommendations tailored to your body type, skin type, and the current season to nourish your skin and maintain overall balance.</li>    <li> Enjoy sweet, juicy fruits like apples and pears in the morning to promote ojas production for enhanced vitality and beauty.</li>    <li>Utilize spices in cooking to aid digestion and impart flavor. Cumin helps to detoxify the body for a radiant complexion.</li>    <li>Include all six tastes in each meal, and avoid skipping meals to keep blood sugar levels stable.</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Does It Actually Work?</h2><p>Ayurveda holds significant importance in India as a formal medical care system. Approximately 80% of the population utilizes some form of traditional Ayurvedic medicine. The country boasts numerous government and private Ayurvedic medical institutions, clinics, and hospitals, reflecting its deep-rooted integration into traditional Indian culture. Proponents of Ayurveda emphasize its effectiveness, bolstered by its extensive historical use spanning millennia.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oa2E6_ayurveda.jpg" alt="Ayurveda"><figcaption><em>© Annie Spratt / Unsplash. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><p>While Ayurveda enjoys widespread use, few studies meeting Western scientific standards have demonstrated its effectiveness. This particularly concerns Rasashastra, a category of Ayurvedic medicines incorporating minerals, metals, and gems for therapeutic purposes.</p><p>Approximately 20% of these medicines, known as Bhasmas, may contain lead and mercury, raising concerns about safety and potential toxicity. While some proponents assert their safety based on specific preparation methods, there is a lack of published scientific evidence supporting these claims.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Research Have to Say?</h2><p>Research conducted by Robert Saper, MD, MPH, Chair of Wellness & Preventive Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, has revealed that around 20% of Ayurvedic medicines in the market and online may contain harmful levels of lead, mercury, and arsenic. Dr. Saper advises caution, recommending avoidance of products containing Bhasmas due to these potential risks.</p><p>In the United States, Ayurveda lacks a nationally recognized licensure program, but some institutions provide Ayurvedic certifications. The National Ayurvedic Medical Association (NAMA) advocates for raising awareness of the Ayurvedic profession. They want to promote scientific research to validate its practices in the country.</p></main>
