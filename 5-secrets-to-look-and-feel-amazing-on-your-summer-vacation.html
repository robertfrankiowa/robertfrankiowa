    <main><h1>5 Secrets to Look and Feel Amazing on Your Summer Vacation</h1><p>You look forward to your summer vacation all year, whether you prefer the beach, the mountains, a far-off city on another continent, or some combination. </p><p>Once you've confirmed the plans, booked everything, packed your bags, and made the trip, you want to look and feel amazing for the whole thing. But stress, travel, and other factors can leave you sapped. The last thing you want after all the anticipation and all the work to get to your vacation spot is to feel worn out, bloated, and sallow.</p><p>Luckily, there are some concrete steps you can take to prevent travel burnout, so you can enjoy every minute of your hard-earned break, and look gorgeous in the photos, too.</p><h2>1. Stay hydrated</h2><p>Even mild dehydration can leave you feeling exhausted, dizzy, headachy, and fatigued. It also can leave your skin feeling dry and cause under-eye circles. Dehydration can even cause sugar cravings. To avoid it, pack a reusable water bottle in your carry-on and keep it with you wherever you go. Keep sipping throughout the day rather than waiting until you're thirsty and chugging. Eating hydrating foods, like fresh fruit and vegetables, also can help.</p><h2>2. Boost your gut health</h2><p>A healthy gut is so important when it comes to feeling your best on vacation (and always). While traveling, you may be eating foods you're not used to, you might be on a different schedule - all kinds of things can cause bloating, make you irregular, or bring on other stomach issues. Plus, a healthy gut is also important for glowing skin, a strong immune system, and overall energy and good health. Be sure to pack science-backed gut health supplement Seed's DS-01 Daily Synbiotic in your carry-on. This broad-spectrum probiotic and prebiotic is formulated with 24 probiotic strains (beyond the ones you usually find in yogurt and other fermented foods) to support whole-body health. It's your secret weapon for looking and feeling fantastic throughout your vacation.</p><h2>3. Get plenty of sleep</h2><p>Whether you're traipsing across time zones or just shifting your usual schedule, vacation can be tough on sleep. But lack of sleep can sap your energy, leave you feeling irritable, and even lower your immunity. To get yourself into a good sleep routine when traveling, move your sleep schedule closer to the time zone you'll be in a few days before you leave, if possible. Once you arrive, try to get on the local schedule as soon as possible. Staying as close to your regular sleep schedule as possible can be helpful, too. </p><h2>4. Eat well</h2><p>Depending on where you're going on your summer vacation, you may be tempted by lots of indulgent foods.There's nothing wrong with enjoying the local cuisine and being freer with food than you might normally be, but it's still a good idea to get in plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit, lean protein, and fiber. Split richer foods and decadent desserts with one of your travel companions, fit some fresh veggies into every meal, and pack a few healthy snacks in your bag so you always have a backup. Watch out for super-sugary drinks as well, which can lead to headaches and unpleasant energy crashes.</p><h2>5. Be active</h2><p>Keeping yourself active while you're on summer vacation will help you feel energized and well, and there are plenty of fun ways to do it without worrying about finding a gym. Going to a beach? See if you can rent a kayak or go stand-up paddleboarding - or just take a swim or stroll the shore and hunt for shells. If you're headed to the mountains, schedule a daily hike or walk (don't forget the camera). Visiting a city or town? Take a walking tour, rent a bike, or explore local parks. </p></main>
