Worse yet, as many as seven out of ten of them are unaware of the symptoms they should be concerned about. Dr. Vithlani highlights lower back pain as one of the alarming signals.</p></strong><p><strong>Pain in the groin area or other discomfort in this region could suggest the presence of prostate cancer</strong>, which often goes undiagnosed due to a lack of knowledge about typical symptoms. Sometimes, these symptoms can be shocking.</p><p><strong>Besides lower back pain, attention should also be paid to</strong>: frequent urination (especially at night), difficulty starting or stopping urination, weak urine stream, the feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, presence of blood in urine or semen, pain in the perineal area, and unexpected weight loss or appetite decrease. Many symptoms can be observed during daily routines.</p><h2>Early diagnosis – key to treatment</h2><p>Dr. Vithlani emphasizes that early diagnosis of prostate cancer is crucial because the early stage of the disease often progresses without apparent symptoms. It is only when the cancer reaches larger sizes and presses on neighboring structures, such as the urinary tract or pelvic bones, that symptoms become more apparent. However, by then, the treatment process is significantly less effective.</p><p><strong>Doctors urge men to undergo regular check-ups with their family doctor</strong>, even if they do not experience any worrying symptoms. They also recommend that men at risk, such as those with a family history of cancer, should undergo prostate exams every two years. Such preventive measures can help avert the disease.</p><p><strong>The likelihood of developing this cancer is 2-3 times higher</strong> in those who have had such cases in their family. These individuals should schedule regular exams.</p><h2>Prostate cancer in young men</h2><p>The problem does not only concern men over the age of 55. The number of young men diagnosed with prostate cancer has <strong>increased nearly sixfold</strong> over the past two decades. Notably, this trend continues.</p><p>Survival in the case of diagnosed prostate cancer primarily depends on the stage of the disease. Radical treatment involving the removal of the prostate means that the percentage of people surviving the next 10 years ranges from 50% to even 75%.</p><p>It is also noticeable that in younger patients, prostate cancer may develop in a more aggressive way, requiring greater vigilance from doctors and the promotion of awareness about the possibility of the disease in these potential patients. Once again, we remind you – <strong>appropriate prevention is key!</strong></p><p><b>Read also:</b></p><p>1 in 8 men face prostate cancer: Why ignoring lower back pain could be fatal</p><p>Pancreatic cancer: spotting the early warning signs for improved prognosis</p><p>Body odor changes that signal serious health issues</p></main>
