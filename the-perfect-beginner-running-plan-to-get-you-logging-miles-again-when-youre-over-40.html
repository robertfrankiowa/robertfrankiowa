    <main><h1>The Perfect Beginner Running Plan To Get You Logging Miles Again When You're Over 40</h1><p>So, you're ready to start your running journey and hit your new fitness goals. Don't worry. <em>WH</em> is right here with you, every step of the way (literally!). This beginner running workout plan is designed to guide you at any age. It lasts four weeks, but you can incorporate the routines into your new gym plan for as long as you need. </p><p>No matter if you used to run six miles on the reg back in college or have never made it around the length of a track, like, ever, these workouts are designed to help you become a stronger runner, while slowly building up to more mileage. </p><p>The guide, programmed by certified personal trainer and running coach at STRIDE Fitness, Paizley Longino, comes programmed with upper and lower-body strength cross-training circuits, stretching tips, and rest day advice. If you want more in-depth guidance on your daily workout routine, you can also scroll down to see step-by-step, day-by-day instructions for your workouts. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Advice Before You Begin</h2><p>The incline walks during cardio sections should be done on a treadmill so you can accurately complete the workout. Benefits of a tread? You can stay in the zone, and there are "no animals, cars, random people" to distract you, Longino explains. On days where you're working with a flat road, you can go find an outdoor track or trail for some fresh air and sunshine.</p><p>For incline levels, try using 3% as your baseline for most "easy" or "moderate" incline walk workouts and warmups. If you're leveling up, try hitting somewhere between 4% to 6% incline, and for "steep" inclines, stick to 6% to 8%.</p><p>When it comes to strength training, Longino says you should select a weight that feels challenging for you by the end of the recommended number of reps. For any exercises that target the shoulders and arms (hammer curls, dumbbell curls, etc.) you can probably start with light or medium dumbbells around 7 to 10 pounds, per Longino. And for exercises targeting larger muscle groups like hamstrings and quads (squats, deadlifts, etc.), use heavier weights around 10 pounds or more.</p><p>Try increasing your weight each week (think 5 pounds at a time), but always listen to your body and assess how you feel after each set before adding weight.</p><figure><img title="Hearst Owned" src="IMG/AA1dcFEi_whmwebrunning_chartloff1jpg.jpg" alt="WHM_Web_Running Chart_lo_FF[1].jpg"><figcaption><em>running over 40 workout plan.

Complete 30 minutes of an incline walk, changing the inclines to challenge yourself and learn your limitations.</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Mindset note:</strong> Be cautious but consistent with your expectations. You're just starting out, so set goals that are reachable.</p><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>Day 2: Upper-Body Strength</strong></h3><p>The goal of incorporating strength training into a running workout is to build muscle and help improve your recovery and endurance. </p><ul><li>Resistance band bicep curls (10 to 12 reps)</li><li>Resistance band anchored lat pulldowns (10 to 12 reps)</li><li>Banded pull-aparts (10 to 12 reps)</li><li>Dumbbell overhead situps (10 reps)</li></ul><p><em>Complete 3 sets.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>Day 3: Stretching</strong></h3><p>A stretch day allows time for your muscles to recover while also improving your flexibility.

You should aim to complete 45 minutes of incline walking work with consistent incline levels. You should also try to level-up your percent incline from your workout on Day 1. For example: If you started at a 3% incline on Day 1, try a 4% or 5% incline this time.</p><ul><li>5 to 7 minute incline walk intervals at 3% to 5% incline</li><li>Rest as needed between each interval, limiting rest to a maximum of 90 seconds</li></ul><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>Day 5: </strong><strong>Lower-Body Strength</strong></h3><ul><li>Bodyweight squat pulses (15 reps)</li><li>Dumbbell deadlifts (10 reps)</li><li>Alternating forward lunges (10 reps on each side)</li><li>Butterfly situps (15 reps)</li></ul><p><em>Complete 3 sets.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>Day 6: Cardio—60-Minute Incline Walk</strong></h3><p>You're back to walking on an incline.
