    <main><h1>‘I Started Resistance Training At 65 And Significantly Reversed My Severe Osteoporosis’</h1><p>I’ve always been an active person, but I consistently had one goal: lose weight and be thin. I started dieting when I was 14 and have since tried every fad diet and workout under the sun. I was addicted to indoor cycling and worked out with personal trainers, but I never lifted anything over 10 pounds. I was afraid of having too much muscle for fear of being “bulky.”</p><p>It wasn’t until a month before my 65th birthday that I realized my inside didn’t match my outside. I had been diagnosed with severe spinal osteoporosis and gained weight the year prior, and I wasn’t confident when I looked in the mirror. I wasn’t getting any younger, but something needed to change. I wanted to train for longevity. </p><h2 class="body-h2">I went to my favorite resource, Instagram, and started looking at what other women were doing and how they were aging. </h2><h2 class="body-h2">I train four days a week and focus on muscle hypertrophy.</h2><p>Now, at 66, I train four days a week: two upper-body days and two lower-body days. My workouts are between an hour and an hour and a half and my goal is muscle hypertrophy (increasing muscle size). </p><p>The number of moves varies per session, but I mainly train with free weights and focus on progressive overload (gradually boosting the intensity of my workouts). Typical moves include shoulder press, bench press, lat pull downs, biceps and triceps work, Romanian deadlifts, Bulgarian split squats, and hip thrusts. </p><figure><img title="Michelle Alber" src="IMG/BB1laFTU_img6865jpeg.jpg" alt="IMG_6865.JPEG"><figcaption><em>IMG_6865.JPEG. Michelle Alber</em></figcaption></figure><p>My favorite exercise is hip thrusts because they make me feel so powerful. My current PR is around 150 pounds and I’m a stickler for proper form. Bulgarian split squats are by far my least favorite. The unilateral move is especially tough, but as my coach says, it’s called training for a reason. Plus, it’s pretty awesome that my body shows up to the gym four days a week to get better and stronger– even when things are hard. </p><p>On top of strength training, I aim for at least 10,000 steps a day and incorporate cardio a few days a week. Whether it’s walking on an incline, biking, swimming, or rowing, I do my best to find fun ways to get my heart rate up. I know the importance of off days, though, so I also incorporate stretching and massages into my routine. </p><h2 class="body-h2">I learned to count macros and properly fuel my body.</h2><p>Most of my life I was strictly focused on being skinny. I starved myself and ate as few calories as I could with the goal to lose weight. I didn’t know how to create a sustainable eating plan and fad diets never taught the maintenance phase, or how to maintain an eating plan to keep my weight steady. Luckily, with the help of my coach, I learned to track macros to maximize nutrition and support my training. Instead of thinking about how little I can eat, I shifted my mindset to treat food as fuel. </p><figure><img title="Michelle Alber" src="IMG/BB1lazhc_screen_shot_2024_04_02_at_15732_pmpng.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-02 at 1.57.32 PM.png"><figcaption><em>a person taking a selfie. Michelle Alber</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, I eat five meals a day and primarily focus on protein. But at each meal I always have protein, carbs, and fat to fit within my overall daily goals (and carbs are important!). Egg whites, chicken breast, ground meat, and salmon are staples in my house, and I load on the veggies at every meal. On days I’m lifting, I eat complex carbs before my workout for extra fuel and I prioritize protein after a training session to rebuild muscle. I also limit alcohol and sugar which I’ve noticed boosts my overall energy and reduces cravings.</p><p>All that said, I do not deprive or restrict myself. I focus on mindful eating because I now know I can fit pretty much anything into my eating plan. It’s all about balance. </p><p><h2 class="body-h2">These three factors were key to my strength transformation success.</h2><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>1. I found an incredible community of like-minded women to remind me that age is just a number.</strong></h4><p>At 66, most people are starting to slow down. But I’ve found an awesome online community that doesn’t focus on age. I’m treated like all the other younger women, and I’ve learned that age is just a mentality. Through the support and connection of others, I’ve made friends from around the world who inspire and motivate my journey. Whether it’s sharing a form cue for a tough move or commenting on a new PR, my community is changing the narrative for women. Age is just a numerical number and not an indicator of who I am or what I can do, and growing with other strong women keeps me motivated.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>2. I believed in my coach so I could focus on discipline and consistency.</strong></h4><p>Prior to my strength journey, I was lost without a sense of direction. I wasn’t putting in the work to see results. But I realized that being coachable was the key to success. My coach knew what she was doing, and I committed to holding up my end of the deal. Instead of purely relying on motivation and fizzling out when things got hard, I created lasting habits to fuel my discipline. </p><figure><img title="Michelle Alber" src="IMG/BB1lav2q_bjn08472jpg.jpg" alt="bjn08472.jpg"><figcaption><em>a couple of women lifting weights. Michelle Alber</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is never a “perfect” time to start or a “right” time to do anything. Was it hard to make major lifestyle changes at 65? Yes! Is it hard to always stick to a routine? Of course! But it’s about choosing your “hard” and taking control of your life. </p><p>Once I understood that strength was the secret to longevity, everything clicked. After just a year and a half of resistance training, I’ve significantly reversed my osteoporosis and I feel better than ever. Looking back, I don’t know why I didn’t figure this out sooner, but now I have no intention of ever stopping. </p><figure><img title="Michelle Alber" src="IMG/BB1lanxe_screen_shot_2024_04_02_at_15718_pmpng.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-02 at 1.57.18 PM.png"><figcaption><em>a person holding a dog.
