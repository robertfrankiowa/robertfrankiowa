    <main><h1>I Lost 40 Pounds on a Vegan Diet and Here's How</h1><p>A TikToker who goes by Vegan of the Sea lost 40 pounds and turned her health around after adopting an oil-free, vegan diet. "Had you told me I'd end up a vegan one day, I'd say you're crazy, but here I am. I feel more energized than ever, and I love knowing I'm nourishing my body with every bite I take of food," she captioned a post. So how exactly did she lose weight and keep it off for almost three years now? Here's what she eats every day to be fit, happy, and healthy.</p><h2>1 No Oils!</h2><p>There is no oil in this vegan's diet. "I switched to an oil-free, vegan, high-carb, low-fat diet. Yes, even healthy fats are good for weight loss. I now incorporate more fats than I used to, but I still exclude oil," she says. "Why no oil? Because it's the most calorie-dense food on the planet. One tbsp of oil has 119 calories! And who stops at just one? You could eat 4 cups of broccoli for the same amount of calories! Is it starting to make sense now?"</p><h2>2 Lots of Vegetables</h2><p>This influencer loves filling up on non-starchy vegetables. "No, I don't eat only bread and potatoes, but they literally make up half of my diet," she captioned a video. "The other half? Non-starchy vegetables. By eating this way, you are going to be full and satisfied, cut out cravings, eat as much as you want, and still lose weight."</p><h2>3 Variety of Foods</h2><p>This TikToker never feels deprived on a vegan diet thanks to the wide variety of foods she eats. "What can you make out of these ingredients? Everything! Pizza, pasta, enchiladas, Pad Thai, sushi, desserts, burritos, soup, casseroles! Everything!" she says.</p><figure><img title="3 Variety of Foods" src="IMG/BB1nFNCO_3_variety_of_foods.jpg" alt="3 Variety of Foods"><figcaption><em>3 Variety of Foods. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 No Fake Vegan Foods</h2><p>This TikToker sticks to real whole foods, not fake ultra-processed vegan meat alternatives. "Yes I'm vegan, but stick to a whole food, high starch, low fat plant based diet also known as the starch solution," she says.</p><h2>5 Mindful of Fats</h2><p>Vegan of the Sea says she would rather eat an avocado than have avocado oil. "I limit my fat intake," she says in a caption. "Even my healthy fats. So, even though nuts and avocados are vegan, they pack a lot of calories per pound. So I limit these high calorie, fatty foods."</p><h2>6 No Calorie Counting</h2><p>While this TikToker is mindful of high-calorie fats, she doesn't count calories in her daily diet. "I have lost the weight from calorie density eating," she says in a caption. "So I eat an abundance of foods low in calories. This way of eating allows me to eat as much as I want without counting calories."</p><h2>7 Adapting Recipes</h2><p>This TikToker knows how to adapt her favorite meals to be plant-based and delicious. She simply substituted certain ingredients to make it healthier. "I create meals I love, without the ingredients that add an abundance of calories that don't fill me up," she says.</p><figure><img title="7 Adapting Recipes" src="IMG/BB1nFz7t_7_adapting_recipes.jpg" alt="7 Adapting Recipes"><figcaption><em>7 Adapting Recipes. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 High Quantity</h2><p>Vegan of the Sea says being able to eat as much as she likes while still losing weight has been a game changer. She works out consistently but doesn't beat herself up if she skips a workout if she's tired. "Find what works for YOU," she says.</p><h2>9 50/50 Plate</h2><p>This TikToker follows what she calls the "50/50" plate. This means half of her plate is a healthy starch, and the other is a non-starchy vegetable. "This allows me to eat as much as I want and not overconsume calories. The mass quantity of food will fill you up, and the starches will keep you full for hours," she says.</p><figure><img title="9 50/50 Plate" src="IMG/BB1nFGwV_9_5050_plate.jpg" alt="9 50/50 Plate"><figcaption><em>9 50/50 Plate. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10 Avoiding White Flour</h2><p>Vegan of the Sea avoids white flour options and focuses on high-fiber ones instead. "I play around with chickpea flour, oat flour, lentil and bean pasta, corn or brown rice tortillas, Ezekiel bread…etc," she says in a caption. "These foods have more fiber and nutrients than white flour and will aid in your weight loss."</p><h2>11 Beautiful Skin and Energy</h2><p>This TikToker says losing weight is just a small part of the benefits she gets from her new lifestyle. She sees improvements in her skin and energy levels and is in the best shape of her life. "It didn't happen overnight, but I found a lifestyle that was doable for me," she says.</p><figure><img title="11 Beautiful Skin and Energy" src="IMG/BB1nFz7H_11_beautiful_skin_and_energy.jpg" alt="11 Beautiful Skin and Energy"><figcaption><em>11 Beautiful Skin and Energy. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>12 Meal Prepping</h2><p>Vegan of the Sea is a big fan of meal prepping, making big batches every time. This way, there is always something healthy to snack on. "Eating this way, you literally eat as much as you want, whenever you want, as long as you're eating the right food," she says.</p><h2>13 Diet Before Exercise</h2><p>This TikToker feels that diet is far more important for her weight loss than exercise. She became physically active later in her weight loss journey. "I started slow and worked my way up, but my success has come mostly from my diet," she says.</p><h2>14 She Loves Potatoes</h2><p>Vegan of the Sea recommends eating plenty of potatoes but avoiding high-calorie toppings. "Did you know potatoes are the most filling food on the planet? Believe me! Eat more potatoes, and you'll lose weight because you just won't be hungry!" she says.</p><h2>15 Consistency Is Key</h2><p>This TikToker was successful because she found something that worked for her long term. "It's the only thing that's ever worked for me, and I've kept the weight off for 2.5 years. Enjoy it, or it won't last," she captioned a post. And if you enjoyed this article, take advantage of these 15 Quick Ways to Lose Body Fat Percentage in a Week.</p></main>
