But scientific research shows that there is actually a lot we can do to drastically increase the chances of living a long, healthy life. </p><p>If you want to live into the triple digits, you might be wondering what habits matter the absolute most. Is it walking every day? Avoiding sugary snacks? Not smoking? While all of these actions are linked to longevity, there’s one sign even above all of these that longevity experts say is a tell-tale sign that someone will live a long, healthy life.</p><h2>The Top Sign You’ll Live To Be 100, According to Longevity Experts</h2><p>One common misconception about longevity is that it’s determined by genetics. <strong>Dr. Elise Eifert Freeman, PhD</strong>, the Graduate Gerontology Program Coordinator at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, explains that genes play a small role in life expectancy; only about 25%. “More significant factors include our environment and lifestyle,” she says. </p><p>There’s one factor in particular—when it comes to environment and lifestyle—that Dr. Freeman says is especially important when it comes to longevity: having social connections. “Dozens of research studies have proven that social connections can directly and indirectly impact longevity,” she explains. </p><p>Dr. Freeman points to research showing that people with larger social networks were 45% less likely to die prematurely than people who didn’t have a social network. “People who have more social support tend to have enhanced mental health, cardiovascular health, immunological functioning, cognitive performance, resilience, life satisfaction, stress response and more,” she shares.</p><p>“We also know that the opposite of social connections—loneliness and isolation—is detrimental to our longevity,” Dr. Freeman says, explaining that the same research that showed the benefits of having a large social network found that being socially isolated increased the odds of death by 91%. “More recently, the Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, MD, MBA, suggested that loneliness is as deadly as smoking up to 15 cigarettes daily!” she adds. </p><p><strong>Dr. John P. Walsh, PhD</strong>, an Associate Professor of Gerontology and the Assistant Dean of Education at the University of Southern California Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, says that strong, reliable familial relationships are especially important when it comes to living a long, healthy life. “Family can be genetic, but it is also the family of community and the family of choice. The trust of this bond means we look out for each other. We know we can rely on our support [system] to pitch in when needed, and you don’t have to ask,” he says. </p><p>Dr. Walsh highlights the Harvard Study on Adult Happiness (famous for being the longest study on happiness) as evidence, which shows that the quality of relationships in one’s life is linked to living a long and happy life.</p><h2>Other Signs You’ll Live To Be 100 </h2><p>Besides having strong relationships, there are other signs that you’re likely going to live a long, healthy life. Dr. Walsh says a big one is not smoking, a habit he says is linked to increasing the risk of the major chronic diseases known to shorten one’s lifespan. </p><p>If you move your body throughout the day, Dr. Walsh says this is another habit that you have in common with people who live to be 100. Walking instead of driving (when it makes sense to do so), taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and doing physical work (like gardening and chores) are all ways to work movement into your day in a purposeful way. </p><p>Of course, diet is important too. “Specifically, people who want to increase their chances of living a long life should get the daily recommended amounts of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids while limiting red and processed meats, beverages with added sugar, trans fat and sodium,” Dr. Freeman says. Dr. Walsh adds to this, saying that minimizing consumption of ultra-processed foods is also linked to living a longer life. </p><p>Again, it’s impossible to know how long one’s life will be. But if you maintain a healthy diet, move your body throughout the day, avoid smoking, and prioritize social connections in your life, you’re already living like a centenarian! </p></main>
