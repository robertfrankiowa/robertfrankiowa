    <title>The Cause of Alzheimer's Could Be Coming From Inside Your Mouth, Study Claims</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative neurological condition that is known for its debilitating symptoms, such as memory loss, confusion, and loss of identity. The two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease are the formation of plaques (beta-amyloid) and tangles (tau proteins)in the brain. How Does Plaque Buildup Impact The Brain? Over time, these build up to a point where […] The post The Cause of Alzheimer’s Could Be Coming From Inside Your Mouth, Study Claims appeared first on The Hearty Soul.">

    <main><h1>The Cause of Alzheimer's Could Be Coming From Inside Your Mouth, Study Claims</h1><h2>The Bacteria In Question?</h2><p><i>Porphyromonas gingivalis. </i>It's not only found in the mouth but in the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, colon, and vagina when suffering from bacterial vaginosis .Several scientific studies (including the examples below) back up the hypothesis that the two are indeed linked; while some researchers are trying to work out the exact mechanisms of the illness:</p><figure><img title="The Bacteria In Question?" src="IMG/BB1pFTsM_the_bacteria_in_question.jpg" alt="The Bacteria In Question?"><figcaption><em>The Bacteria In Question?.

Another study found that tooth loss also appeared to be linked to Alzheimer’s and that the more teeth that fell out, the more the illness increased.This evidence implies greater importance to keeping an optimal level of oral health than originally imagined.</p><p>In 2017 a study conducted in Bristol (UK) led scientists to believe that the pathogen was the cause of the neural inflammation previously associated with the disease. “We now have strong evidence connecting <i>P. gingivalis</i> and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis, but more research needs to be done before <i>P. gingivalis</i> is explicitly implicated in the causation or morbidity of AD (Alzheimer’s Disease),” reported David Emery .</p><figure><img title="What Did Studies Find?" src="IMG/BB1pG5kn_what_did_studies_find.jpg" alt="What Did Studies Find?"><figcaption><em>What Did Studies Find?.

It helps to solidify that the bacteria implicated, Porphyromonas gingivalis, is also found in the brains of deceased Alzheimer patients. To put it simply, the more chronic exposure a person has to this bacteria, the higher the risk of experiencing cognitive in later life. </p><p>Author of the latest, 2019 study, Stephen Dominy concurs that its findings have linked the likelihood of the cause-effect relationship shared by gum disease and Alzheimer’s. While not definitively proven, the findings certainly add to the weight of evidence already discovered: “Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, <i>P. gingivalis</i>, and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis while also demonstrating the potential for a class of small molecule therapies to change the trajectory of disease." </p><figure><img title="Confirmations Made" src="IMG/BB1pG2Rj_confirmations_made.jpg" alt="Confirmations Made"><figcaption><em>Confirmations Made.

These include getting a good night’s sleep, developing your brain by constantly learning and developing new skills, exercising regularly, and eating well . </p><p>In conclusion, Alzheimer’s still has some way to go in terms of a cure, but these new findings give new hope that its development can be averted. At the very least, this study gives us all more of an incentive to maintain good oral health and to visit the dentist regularly.</p><h4>Sources</h4><ol>   <li class="has-small-font-size">Harvard Health Letter.
