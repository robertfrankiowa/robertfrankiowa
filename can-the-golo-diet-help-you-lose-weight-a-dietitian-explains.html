    <main><h1>Can the GOLO diet help you lose weight? A dietitian explains</h1><p>Fad diets come and go, but the GOLO diet has been making the rounds for years now. It’s easy to see why. The promise of a pill to help promote weight loss, help with hunger, and burn fat — and a diet plan that says you’ll burn fat more efficiently? Who wouldn’t want to sign up? But before you do, let’s take a look at what the science says and who the plan will (and won’t) work for.</p><h2>What is the GOLO diet?</h2><p>The GOLO diet, created by the GOLO company, is a weight-loss program based on the premise that insulin resistance causes hunger, cravings, overeating and ultimately weight gain. It has two elements: the GOLO Release supplement, which they claim can help control insulin levels, and the GOLO for Life Food Plan, which they say helps "your body process stored fat, repair your metabolism, and reverse the damage caused by conventional diets."</p><p>Sounds impressive, but does it work? Here’s what you should know before deciding to try the GOLO diet.</p><h2>How the GOLO diet Works</h2><p>The core concept behind the GOLO diet is that insulin resistance is at the root of your weight problems. Insulin resistance happens when, over time, your cells become less responsive to insulin, and therefore, they don’t take up glucose (or sugar) from your blood efficiently. At this point, your body produces more insulin to clear the glucose from your blood, and when you over-produce insulin, you may experience an increased appetite and ultimately gain weight or have difficulty losing weight.</p><p>The GOLO diet claims that its proprietary supplement, Release, can help you control insulin and promote weight loss without dieting. The pill is paired with the GOLO For Life Food Plan, which they say will help eliminate stored fat and repair your metabolism. However, it’s worth mentioning again that the evidence behind this plan is weak, and almost anyone who has ever tried to lose weight can attest to the fact that it takes some (if not lots of) effort. Claims of easy weight loss are a big red flag.</p><h2>Can the GOLO diet pill help with weight loss?</h2><p>The bottom line? No. Be wary of any weight loss plan that suggests there may be an easy way to lose weight. Though the company cites data suggesting their Release supplement can enhance weight loss, the research quality is low. All of it is sponsored by the company, involves very small populations for a short period of time, and most isn’t published in peer-reviewed journals. The peer review process means that scientific findings are subject to the scrutiny of others with expertise in the field, and without this, the findings aren’t nearly as meaningful.</p><p>Plus, keep in mind that studies involve the GOLO system — not just the supplement but the diet and exercises too, so it’s hard to know what, if any, benefit comes from the pill. However, what we do know is that supplements have never been demonstrated to produce long-term weight loss benefits.</p><h2>GOLO side effects</h2><p>According to GOLO's website "Release contains no harmful ingredients, caffeine, or other stimulants and is considered safe to take with medications and has no known side effects."</p><p>But even if a supplement is plant-based and natural, it might cause side effects. Supplements can also interfere with the medications you’re taking. For example, ingredients in Release may interfere with diabetes medication, which might cause your blood sugar to dip too low.</p><h2>GOLO diet foods: What you'll eat on the plan</h2><p>Here are some of the foods you’ll eat on the GOLO Diet:</p><ul><li><p>Vegetables: salad greens, asparagus, broccoli, carrots and zucchini</p></li><li><p>Fruit: strawberries, grapefruit, bananas</p></li><li><p>Carbohydrates: whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, steel-cut oats, brown rice</p></li><li><p>Dairy: whole milk, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt</p></li><li><p>Protein: eggs, lean meat, fish, tofu</p></li><li><p>Fats: nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil</p></li></ul><p>It’s recommended that you eat these foods in the correct balance, which entails eating mostly protein, then non-starchy veggies, a small amount of starchy carbs (such as fruit, starchy veggies, or whole grains), and a small amount of fat.</p><p>Unprocessed, protein-heavy snacks are allowed, but most sweets and processed foods are limited on the GOLO diet.</p><h2>Will the GOLO diet help you lose weight?</h2><p>Make no mistake: The GOLO diet is a calorie-reducing diet. The GOLO Food for Life Plan supplies between 1,300 and 1,800 calories per day through mostly unprocessed foods. In studies on the GOLO diet, participants followed calorie goals that equated to a 500-calorie deficit.</p><p>If you’re used to eating larger portions of foods and your diet (like most Americans) includes a lot of ultraprocessed foods, making the changes suggested on the GOLO diet could produce weight loss. But these changes may also feel restrictive and overwhelming. That can set you up for failure with the program, leading to feelings of stress and shame. It isn’t you; it’s the plan.</p><p>Many weight loss programs are unsustainable because they don’t match your lifestyle (say, how often you like to cook or order out) and food preferences, and because they promote portions that aren’t filling enough for you, you might end up overeating. If you’re not used to cooking most of your meals, having to do so may be an additional challenge to overcome.</p><p>That said, the GOLO diet emphasizes whole foods over heavily processed ones, which is a good strategy for managing your weight. Time and again, studies show this approach is helpful and also promotes better life-long health.</p><p>Case in point: A Stanford University study compared the effects of a low-carb to a low-fat diet, trying to determine if a person’s genotype made one diet better than another for their weight loss. The results? People lost weight on both diets, but the main reason was this: They were following the advice to eat as many veggies and whole foods as possible and to reduce added sugars and refined flours.</p><p>A separate study fed a whole-foods diet or a calorie-, carb-, fat-, and protein-matched processed foods diet to a group of participants. When eating more processed foods, they ate faster and gained about two pounds over a two-week period. Those very same people lost about two pounds over the same period when eating whole foods.</p><p>Whole foods take longer to eat, have more fiber, and are more filling than processed foods, so embracing these types of foods may promote weight loss. Learning how to manage portion sizes and balance meals is also useful.</p><p>One thing we know by now is that losing weight can be challenging. Also, keep in mind that we’re all individuals, and just because a program works for one person, it doesn’t mean it will work for you.</p><h2>Who should not take GOLO?</h2><p>The GOLO diet and pill isn't a fit for everyone. You may want to avoid this diet if:</p><ol><li>You’re pregnant or nursing. The calorie levels may be too low, and it’s best to avoid supplements unless recommended by your doctor.</li><li>You have a medical condition, including insulin resistance, prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. Check with your physician before beginning the GOLO diet and Release supplement. If you do go forward with GOLO, you may need to adjust your medications.</li><li>You are a chronic dieter or have any disordered eating habits. These people should think twice about the GOLO diet. It’s unhealthy to lose and then regain weight repeatedly, and the GOLO diet may contribute to this pattern.</li></ol><h2>Things to consider before trying the GOLO diet</h2><p>Anyone can lose weight on a low-calorie menu, such as the GOLO diet, but whether that’s healthy or sustainable for you is the real question. And whether the supplement adds any benefit remains to be seen. If you want to give the GOLO diet a try, consult with your physician first. They may recommend an alternative that would be better suited for you.</p><p>And remember: For long-term success, pick an approach that’s based on whole foods, limits (but doesn’t unnecessarily restrict) less-healthful, processed fare, and teaches other tools, such as learning how to respond to your body’s appetite signals.</p></main>
