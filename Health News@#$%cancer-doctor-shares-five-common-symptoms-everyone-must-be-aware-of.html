    <main><h1>Cancer doctor shares five common symptoms everyone must be aware of</h1><p><strong>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, responsible for one in six deaths globally, and catching it early is the key to improving your survival rate. </strong></p><p>An oncology specialist has shared five common symptoms that everyone should be aware of as they could be a sign of any type of cancer.</p><h2>5 common cancer symptoms</h2><p>“Although cancer symptoms can present in different ways including without any symptoms at all, here are some common signs,” Oncology Hospitalist Dr. Tim Tiutan said on TikTok. “Please share this with someone because it can save a life.”</p><h2>1. Losing weight unintentionally</h2><p>The first symptom that could be a sign of cancer is losing weight unintentionally or sudden weight loss that cannot be explained.</p><p>・<strong>BE AWARE:</strong> Rare cancer symptom appears when you drink alcohol, hematologist warns</p><p>Weight loss or gain of 10 pounds or more for “no known reason” is listed as one of the main cancer symptoms by the American Cancer Society.</p><p>People often lose weight because cancer cells use up lots of the body’s energy supply, or cancer can change the way the body makes energy.</p><h2>2. Excessive fatigue </h2><p>Another common sign is extreme fatigue, which is feeling tired all the time despite sleeping, and it doesn’t get better with rest.</p><p>Cancer related fatigue affects almost 65 out of 100 people with the disease, Cancer Research UK reveals.</p><p>Lacking energy is one of the most common symptoms and can affect you physically, emotionally, and mentally.</p><h2>3. Chronic night sweats and fevers</h2><p>Experiencing regular night sweats and fevers is another early symptom of cancer that you should be aware of.</p><p>A fever is when your body temperature is higher normal, causing you to feel hot, sweaty and generally unwell.</p><p>Waking up with soaking wet night clothes and bedding even though your bedroom is cool is the main symptom of night sweats, the NHS reveals.</p><h2>4. Lumps and masses</h2><p>One of the first symptoms of cancer is often swelling or lumps anywhere in the body, commonly on the chest, neck, breast or armpit.</p><p>They are not always a cause for concern and can often be non-cancerous cysts or tumors, but it’s always best to get lumps checked.</p><p>The NHS says to see a doctor if your lump is hard and does not move, is painful, red or hot, gets bigger or lasts more than two weeks.</p><h2>5. Blood in the stool</h2><p>Blood in the stool is one of the most common signs of bowel cancer and should always be taken seriously.</p><p>The American Cancer Society says any change in bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhea, or a change in how your stools look can be a cancer symptom.</p><p>Bladder changes such as pain when passing urine, blood in the urine or needing to go to the toilet more or less often can also be a cause for concern.</p><p>Those are five of the most common cancer symptoms, but it’s important to remember they can also be signs of many other serious and non-serious diseases. It’s important to speak to your healthcare provider who can always offer further guidance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Timothy Tiutan is an Oncology Hospitalist who gained his medical degree from the University of Arizona College of Medicine. He treats people with cancer at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. </strong></p></main>
