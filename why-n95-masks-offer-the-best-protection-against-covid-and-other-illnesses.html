    <main><h1>Why N95 masks offer the best protection against Covid and other illnesses</h1><p><em>Select independently determines what we cover and recommend.

Learn more. </em></p><p>If you’re concerned about spiking COVID cases, you may be looking to restock your supply of face masks (and at-home COVID tests). For the highest level of protection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing properly fitted respirators, including N95s approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p><p>To learn more about N95 masks, I consulted medical experts about who should use them, when to wear them and how they're different from KN95 masks and other disposable face coverings. I also compiled highly rated N95 masks that are approved for use by NIOSH and available online. (Note that most people use “mask” and “respirator” interchangeably, but when the CDC and medical professionals say “respirator,” they specifically mean fitted face coverings with certified filtration, like N95s, KN95s and KF94s).</p><p><strong>SKIP AHEAD </strong><strong><em>How I picked the best N95 masks</em></strong><strong> | </strong><strong><em>The best N95 respirators to shop</em></strong> <strong>|</strong> <strong><em>How to shop for N95 masks</em></strong></p><h2>How I picked the best N95 masks</h2><p>While shopping for N95 masks, experts recommend keeping the following in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>NIOSH approval</strong>: You should only purchase N95s listed on NIOSH’s list of approved models — they’ve undergone specific testing to meet NIOSH’s performance and quality requirements, which includes making sure they filter out at least 95% of very small particles (0.3 microns in size).</li><li><strong>Appropriate markings</strong>: Specific markings on an N95 mask indicate that it’s NIOSH-approved. These markings include identifying information verified using NIOSH’s Certified Equipment List, filter designations, model numbers and more.</li><li><strong>Features</strong>: N95 masks should have two straps that go around your head and an adjustable wire nose bridge. These features help ensure that the mask fits tightly against your face, experts told us.</li></ul><h2>The best N95 masks to purchase</h2><p>There are dozens of N95s on NIOSH’s list of approved models, but some of them are surgical N95s, which should be reserved for medical workers, according to the CDC. Excluding those options, below I compiled the best N95 masks, which are available to shop online and meet NIOSH requirements, as well as expert-recommended criteria. Some N95s come packaged together, while others are individually wrapped.</p><h3>3M Aura N95 Respirator</h3><p>3M Aura N95 Respirator</p><figure><img title="Amazon" src="IMG/BB1o2KSQ_3m_aura_n95_respirator_amazon_amazon.jpg" alt="3M Aura N95 Respirator (Amazon / Amazon)"><figcaption><em>3M Aura N95 Respirator (Amazon / Amazon).

It is a quality assurance indicator that the respirator will perform as expected,” says Dr. Stella Hines, an associate professor in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</p><p>Medical experts told us that all N95s — whether they come in cup, flat fold or duckbill shapes — should have the following features:</p><ul><li>Appropriate markings printed on the respirator indicating that it’s NIOSH-approved</li><li>Two straps that go around the head, which experts say are used instead of ear loops on all N95 models to create a tighter seal against the face</li><li>An adjustable wire nose bridge</li></ul><p>You should not buy N95s that have exhaust ports, which holds true for all face masks, says Rempel. The CDC also states that “special N95 respirators labeled as ‘surgical’ or ‘medical’ should be prioritized for healthcare workers.”</p><h2>Meet our experts</h2><p>At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.
