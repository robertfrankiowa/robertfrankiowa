Your boss probably annoys you; your co-workers might talk all day, every day; and you’ve probably picked up someone else’s slack more times than you’d like to admit. However, while every job has its ups and downs, your mental health shouldn’t be spiraling out of control because of it. </p><p>In a 2005 study, 25 percent of people witnessed daily workplace incivility and 50 percent said they were victims of it at least once a week in the previous year. In addition, more recent studies have determined that employees who have experienced workplace incivility, such as low job security and social support, can develop adverse effects, like increased depression, impaired job performance or decreased job satisfaction. </p><p>Luckily, due to the increased awareness of toxic workplace culture, companies across America have been developing programs to combat incivility, but that doesn’t mean things are perfect. So to help determine if your job is negatively affecting you, we connected with a few experts to find out the signs you should look out for to determine if your mental health is in jeopardy.</p><h2>Your Sleep Schedule Has Changed</h2><p>“Changes in sleep patterns represent one of the clearest signs that your work is negatively impacting you outside of your job,” said licensed New York psychologist Gregory Kushnick. </p><p>It’s common knowledge that your mental health can deteriorate when you don’t get enough sleep. But it can be hard to end this vicious cycle when your job is the culprit for your lack of sleep. Instead of calling out from work, try to determine what exactly about your job is causing your restless nights. The minute you determine this, the earlier you can address it and get back to counting sheep.</p><h2>You’re Overcome With Fear While at Work</h2><p>The lack of stability at your job can cause mental stress over time, especially when clear communication isn’t a major concern at the office. Constantly worrying about your company or your performance can cause anxious thoughts and trust issues. </p><p>“You can identify if your job is the source of mental health issues by the presence of subtle or obvious shifts in your physical and mental state on a workday versus the weekend,” said Kushnick. “If you enter work and are overcome by a fear of impending doom or you lose hope, you know the job is doing something to you that must be deal with.”</p><h2>You’ve Become a Recluse</h2><p>When you’re no longer happy at your job, your drive to socialize with your co-workers will naturally decrease over time, especially if you no longer trust them. According to Kushnick, you may “find yourself avoiding any conversations at work” and may even separate yourself from the team entirely just to get work done.</p></main>
