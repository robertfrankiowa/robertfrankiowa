Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Emily Lachtrupp, M.S., RD</strong><p>Tomatoes: Sweet, juicy—and nutritious. From cherry and grape to Roma and Campari, these beauties are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that may play a role in helping to reduce your risk of certain diseases, as well as supporting digestive and skin health.</p><p>There are endless ways to add more tomatoes to your diet, with recipes like Hasselback Tomato Caprese Salad, Sheet-Pan Ratatouille and The Best Tomato Sandwich. If you’re eating tomatoes regularly, you’re doing a good thing for your health. Learn about the nutrition in tomatoes, plus their potential health-improving benefits.</p><h2>Health Benefits of Tomatoes</h2><h3>Reduces Heart Disease Risk</h3><p>Tomatoes are rich in the antioxidant lycopene, which provides their beautiful red color, says Erika Barrera, M.P.H., RDN, owner of Leafe Nutrition. Due to their lycopene content, eating tomatoes regularly may help protect against heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. How so? Lycopene may help neutralize inflammation involved in the process that leads to plaque buildup in arteries. Additional research has found that people who have the highest blood levels of lycopene have a 14% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Sun-dried tomatoes are among the foods that have the highest levels of lycopene.  And there’s no better time to try out this Slow-Cooker Sun-Dried Tomato and Spinach Pasta Bake.</p><h3>May Aid in Cancer Prevention</h3><p>Tomatoes are rich in a variety of carotenoids (including lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene), which may have anti-cancer properties—especially for specific types of cancer. Several studies have shown that eating tomatoes regularly, particularly cooked tomatoes, is associated with a lower prostate cancer risk in men. The American Cancer Society recommends eating a balanced diet for cancer prevention, including a variety of colorful vegetables, like tomatoes.</p><h3>Improves Skin Health</h3><p>You can probably guess why tomatoes promote skin health and a healthy complexion—it’s because of their high antioxidant content, which helps fend off free radicals that can cause damage to the body, including the skin. What’s more, they offer vitamin A, which is also important for skin and hair health.</p><p>Then, there’s the fact that they are rich in water. Barrera says, “Tomatoes also have a high water content of about 95%,” which provides extra hydration to the body and skin. There is some evidence to suggest that consuming tomatoes, particularly processed tomato products (like tomato paste), may pump up the skin’s natural defenses against UV damage. (That said, it’s never a substitute for consistent sunscreen application.) What’s more, tomatoes are an excellent source of vitamin C, a vitamin needed for synthesis of collagen, a structure in skin that keeps it springy.</p><h3>Tomatoes and Digestive Health</h3><p>Tomato sauce provides both soluble and insoluble fiber, which supports gut health and healthy digestion. (Fresh tomatoes provide mostly insoluble fiber.) Soluble fiber attracts water to create a gel-like texture during digestion, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool. Both of these nutrients support regular bowel movements that are easier to pass.</p><p>Although there is a misconception that nightshades—a family of plants that includes tomatoes —can cause digestive issues, tomatoes are generally safe to consume unless someone has an allergy or sensitivity. </p><h3>Are Tomatoes Safe for Everyone to Eat?</h3><p>Tomatoes are generally safe for everyone to eat unless you have an allergy to them. People with acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may want to avoid or limit the amount of tomatoes they eat, as acidic foods can often make heartburn worse. Some people with reflux can tolerate cooked tomatoes in small amounts. You can experiment with different types and amounts of tomatoes to see what your body can handle or if it’s better to avoid them altogether. There are so many other antioxidant-rich foods that you can incorporate in your diet if tomatoes don’t sit well with you.</p><h2>Nutritional Profile of Tomatoes</h2><p>One cup of raw grape tomatoes (approximately 152 grams) contains the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Calories:</strong> 47</li><li><strong>Total Carbohydrates:</strong> 8 g</li><li><strong>Dietary Fiber:</strong> 3 g</li><li><strong>Protein:</strong> 1 g </li><li><strong>Total Fat:</strong> 1 g </li><li><strong>Sodium: </strong>9 mg</li><li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> 41 mg (45% Daily Value)</li><li><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> 6 mcg (5% Daily Value)</li><li><strong>Vitamin A: </strong>672 mcg (75% Daily Value)</li></ul><h2>Tips for Enjoying Tomatoes</h2><h3>Oven-Roasted</h3><p>Not only does roasting bring out even more sweetness in tomatoes, heat actually boosts their health properties. “Cooking tomatoes makes the lycopene more available for your body,” says Krista Wale, RDN, founder and owner of Louisiana Nutrition Associates. This is because some of the phytonutrients are trapped in the cell walls of the tomato but, when heated, become easier for the body to absorb.We love this easy 3-Ingredient Cheese Tortellini with Tomatoes & Basil or this Warm Spinach Salad with Chickpeas & Roasted Tomatoes.</p><h3>As a Snack</h3><p>Add raw cherry tomatoes to a snack plate alongside hummus and crackers (like these Homemade Multi-Seed Crackers) to make a balanced snack that will lift you out of any afternoon slump. “Consuming tomatoes raw preserves their vitamin C content, which is great for your immune system,” says Wale. Her favorite way to use tomatoes is in a zesty salsa. “Whether scooped up on a crunchy tortilla chip or spooned over grilled chicken tacos, tomatoes can add freshness and flavor to all of your meals and snacks,” she says.</p><p>These Caprese Skewers are another fun and tasty way to snack on tomatoes. For a filling high-fiber snack, try tomatoes in our Chickpea Snack Salad.</p><h3>On Bread</h3><p>Sliced tomatoes make a flavorful and nutrient-dense addition to any sandwich, open-faced or closed. We’re obsessed with this Ricotta-Tomato Toast and enjoy it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Another favorite is The Ultimate Vegetarian Club Sandwich. You can’t go wrong with this classic Bruschetta recipe either.</p><p>Salads seem like the most obvious way to enjoy tomatoes, but the <em>EatingWell</em> salad recipes are anything but boring. This Grilled Corn Salad with Chili-Miso Dressing is perfect for a summer barbecue or a delicious take-to-work lunch. If you're not big on green salads, try this Taco Pasta Salad, which calls for cherry tomatoes.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Tomatoes contain many nutrients and phytochemicals, including vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium and lycopene. Adding tomatoes to your diet can improve heart health, reduce cancer risk and promote better digestion. The antioxidants contained in tomatoes may also have anti-aging effects and promote healthier-looking skin. Enjoy a variety of tomatoes, cooked or raw, in different ways to reap the most nutrients they have to offer.</p><p>    <strong>Are tomatoes healthy for weight loss?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Tomatoes are low in calories and high in fiber, making them helpful for people who are trying to lose weight.

If you like the flavor and wish to eat them daily, go for it. Canned, sun-dried or fresh, tomatoes can be a healthy addition to your routine.</p><p>    <strong>Are there cons to eating tomatoes?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Tomatoes are high in acid, so they can exacerbate symptoms of acid reflux (GERD) for some people.
