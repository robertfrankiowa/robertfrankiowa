    <main><h1>14 Reasons Why You Should Consider Single Lifestyle</h1><p>Nowadays, more and more women are embracing a single life. Gone are the days of being shunned for your singledom, and feeling like you simply <em>need </em>to be in a relationship. So why the recent shift? We’ve listed 14 of the most common reasons women are happily going it alone. </p><figure><img title="14 Reasons Why You Should Consider Single Lifestyle" src="IMG/BB1nCQ5J_14_reasons_why_you_should_consider_single_lifestyle.jpg" alt="14 Reasons Why You Should Consider Single Lifestyle"><figcaption><em>14 Reasons Why You Should Consider Single Lifestyle.

Not that any good partner should hold you back, but when you’re single you’re able to be a little bit more spontaneous. Imagine the freedom of setting your own itinerary and following your whims wherever they may lead.</p><h2>They no longer want to settle for less than they deserve</h2><p>Too many times, people jump into relationships because they hate the idea of being single. But at some point, you get to the stage where you know exactly what you want from a partner, and anything less than that simply isn’t worth entertaining. It’s about valuing your own happiness and not settling for anything less than the connection and compatibility you genuinely desire.</p><h2>No longer a taboo</h2><p>Once upon a time, if you were unmarried or unattached then you were seen as being ‘left on the shelf’ like you were waiting your whole damn life for someone to come and pick you up and save you. Well, in 2024 we’re not doing that anymore. As Hack Spirit states, people are less quick to judge single women. Just about time!</p><h2>Relationships aren’t easy</h2><p>Relationships aren’t always easy. Some women would rather do without the hassle and lead a simple life drama-free. Not that all relationships bring drama, but everyone has a little baggage that can rear its ugly head from time to time. However, there’s beauty in solitude and independence, where you can focus on your own growth and happiness without the complexities.</p><h2>Self-care is more important to them</h2><p>Self-care is so important, but we can often neglect to take that time out for ourselves when we’re in a relationship. That’s not to say we can’t prioritize self-care when we have somebody, but it can be forgotten. It’s essential to remember that nurturing our own well-being ultimately strengthens the relationship as well. When we prioritize self-care, we bring our best selves to the partnership, creating a healthier dynamic for both parties involved – should we want to be in a relationship.</p><figure><img title="Self-care is more important to them" src="IMG/BB1mQOxa_self_care_is_more_important_to_them.jpg" alt="Self-care is more important to them"><figcaption><em>Self-care is more important to them.

This also goes for same-sex relationships. No one wants to be in a relationship with a man-child. A lot of women want to find a man who has their shit together, and a lot of the good ones are already taken.</p><h2>They no longer believe in the fairytale</h2><p>Growing up watching Disney movies, it was always the same. The woman is saved by a handsome, charming man, otherwise – she dies at the hands of a dragon or a wicked stepmother. This idea that we need to be rescued is old news. We can rescue ourselves, thank you very much. Although, in all honesty, I don’t fancy my chances against a dragon. Where’s Shrek when you need him?</p><h2>They’re in no rush to settle down</h2><p>A lot of our parents and grandparents were married at 21 with their third child on the way. While that all sounds lovely, women nowadays want to live their lives a little before even thinking about kids and marriage (if ever). Some women focus solely on their careers, others want to travel the world, and some want to do both. There’s plenty of time for the other stuff later.</p><h2>Sex without the commitment</h2><p>While this belief isn’t shared by everyone, sex doesn’t just have to happen to make babies. For starters, not every woman wants children. Of course, slut shaming still exists, but we’re onto it now. If men can sow their oats and play the field, then why can’t we? Nowadays, hookup culture is all around us. And as long as everything is done consensually, scratching an itch without having to commit is perfectly normal.</p><figure><img title="Sex without the commitment" src="IMG/BB1mR22A_sex_without_the_commitment.jpg" alt="Sex without the commitment"><figcaption><em>Sex without the commitment.

But the idea of ‘letting yourself go’ when you’re with someone isn’t entirely false. A study, as seen in Time, highlighted the many health benefits that come with being single.</p><figure><img title="Benefits health" src="IMG/BB1mR4yT_benefits_health.jpg" alt="Benefits health"><figcaption><em>Benefits health.

This is why a lot of women would rather not put themselves through it all again, just to be let down. They’d prefer to focus on themselves and wait until someone genuine comes along who wants the same things they want.</p><h2>Self-love is more important</h2><p>A lot of women are now discovering that their self-worth comes from within, as opposed to relying on others to provide it for them. This isn’t exactly an easy one to achieve, so when you find out how to do this – let me know. It’s a journey of self-discovery and empowerment, learning to love and value oneself independently of external validation. But once you tap into that inner well of self-worth, it’s a game-changer, influencing every aspect of your life in the most positive ways.</p><h2>More Opportunities</h2><p>Being a single woman also gives you access to more opportunities. For instance, when it comes to your career, not having a partner gives you the freedom to travel to whatever country you fancy to start anew. Being single also means you can decide to travel full-time without fear of leaving your partner behind or start a new business knowing that your financial situation only impacts yourself and does not affect your family unit.</p><h2>Opportunity For Growth</h2><p>Some women may choose the single lifestyle only for some time to focus on themselves, particularly their personal growth. Right after a tough break-up or divorce, plenty of people usually decide to take a break from relationships not only to properly heal but also to figure out what went wrong and address their issues.</p></main>
