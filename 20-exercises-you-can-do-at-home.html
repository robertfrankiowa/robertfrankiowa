    <main><h1>20 exercises you can do at home</h1><p>There's never been a better (or more necessary) time for at-home workouts. With remote work continuing to be a part of our everyday lives, people spend a lot of time at home, which means working out from home is becoming a necessity for many. </p><p>Don't worry if you don't have the space (or the money) to build an at-home gym. The following exercises require nothing more than your body weight (and perhaps a chair or two). </p><h2>Push-ups</h2><p>Everyone knows the push-up exercise by now. It's no secret that this is one of the most versatile at-home workouts and has remained a staple in the fitness community. No weights are needed (though adding weight certainly adds intensity), and there are plenty of variations you can do from the comfort of your home, including wide-hand push-ups, diamond push-ups, and military push-ups, among others. </p><h2>Sit-ups</h2><p>Let's tackle another fitness staple: the sit-up. Why has it remained a constant for fitness-goers all these years? It gets the job done. There are only so many exercises that target the core in this compact way, which makes the sit-up one that you should always keep in your routine. </p><h2>Planks</h2><p>The dreaded plank pushes your body to its limit. Once you get over your disdain for this exercise, you'll quickly realize why it's essential. With your body horizontal to the ground and only your elbows, forearms, and toes holding you up, the plank puts all of the pressure on your core to keep you upright. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds and increase the time over each set.  </p><h2>Jumping jacks</h2><p>Jumping jacks not only have a cool name, but they serve your body well, thanks to them being a full-body workout. Everything from your arms to your legs and even your core are being utilized in this motion. If you feel you've mastered the basic jumping jack, variations, such as a squat jack, will increase the intensity. If you aren't doing these regularly, consider incorporating them into your routine with five one-minute sets. </p><h2>Squats</h2><p>You don't need a barbell loaded with weights to properly execute a squat. Your body weight will suffice, and you'll quickly notice the burn that comes along with this exercise. Your lower body will thank you for this one (well, maybe not at first, but once the burn subsides!). There are many variations of squats you can incorporate, including jumping squats and pulse squats. Both of which need no weights and can be done in the comfort of your home. </p><figure><img title="Squats" src="IMG/BB1jxyto_squats.jpg" alt="Squats"><figcaption><em>Squats.

The reason people have this reaction is because they're challenging. That's precisely what you want from an exercise! Standing upright to start, you squat before throwing your feet back into a push-up position. From there, you do the inverse, bringing your feet and knees back into a squatting stance, then leaping up into a standing position. A few minutes of these will have your body aching in the best possible way. </p><h2>Lunges</h2><p>Lunges are another exercise perfect for targeting the lower body. Whether you do the standard forward lunge or any of its variations, like reverse lunges, split squats, or a Curtsy lunge, they all aim to increase your balance and strengthen your glutes, hips, and the rest of your leg muscles. </p><h2>Mountain climbers</h2><p>If you haven't heard of the mountain climber, no worries! They're a fun exercise to add to your repertoire due to the intensity they naturally have. Assume a push-up stance and bring your knees towards your chest one leg at a time, going back and forth at whatever speed you're comfortable with while maintaining control. You can do short circuits of these, such as going for 20-30 seconds, taking a quick break around 10-15 seconds, then going right back into another set and repeating that for 3-5 sets.  </p><h2>Dips</h2><p>You can execute the proper dip by using that couch or the chair in the corner. This exercise targets your chest and triceps, and if you adjust your position, you can also feel them in your shoulders. </p><h2>Calf raises</h2><p>What's great about calf raises is that you can literally do them anywhere, whenever. While standing, you simply raise yourself up while keeping your toes on the ground. This is a concentrated exercise that really tones and strengthens your calves. </p><h2>Leg raises</h2><p>Leg raises make up for what certain abdominal exercises lack. They're one of the best at-home workouts to target your lower core, which is often one of the most underappreciated parts of your body when exercising. Focusing on your lower core will also help with belly fat.</p><h2>Bicycle crunch</h2><p>There are many at-home ab workouts, but the bicycle crunch is one of the best ones. Similar to the mountain climber in its high-paced nature, the proper bicycle crunch crushes your core while also burning calories. Assume a crunch position, and as the name suggests, pretend you're riding a bicycle while lying down, bringing your knees up towards your chin while performing a crunch. A circuit of these will have you sweating in no time! </p><h2>Bridge</h2><p>Like leg raises, this ab exercise targets often-forgotten parts of your core. Bridges are also great for your lower back, and we all know that's always an area we could improve! To perform a bridge, lay down with your arms extended down and your knees bent. Then, you simply elevate your bottom off the ground while keeping your upper back and shoulders on the ground. </p><figure><img title="Bridge" src="IMG/BB1jxiAK_bridge.jpg" alt="Bridge"><figcaption><em>Bridge.

You bring your knees to your elbows and go back and forth for a set amount of time. </p><figure><img title="Step-up knee raises" src="IMG/BB1jxytP_step_up_knee_raises.jpg" alt="Step-up knee raises"><figcaption><em>Step-up knee raises.

This workout targets your thighs and butt. Don't forget to switch sides and perform this with your other leg! </p><h2>Spider crawl</h2><p>This bodyweight exercise targets your chest and really tests your balance. Find a space at home or outside where you have about 10-15 feet of space to work with. Assume a push-up position, and just as Spider-Man climbs up walls, you move yourself by moving your right hand forward while bringing your right knee forward, then repeating with your left side and alternating back and forth until you run out of space. </p><h2>Long jump</h2><p>You don't need to have a sand pit like they do in the Olympics to perform a long jump at home. Instead of getting a running start, find a space at home, perhaps outside if possible or in a garage. Standing straight up, lower into a squat position before jumping forward. This motion boosts your lower half strength. If you don't have the space to jump forward, you can also jump upwards and accomplish a similar effect. </p><h2>Superman</h2><p>This fun exercise is performed exactly how you'd imagine. Do you recall how Superman looks when he's flying? That's all you need to do while lying on the floor. At the top point, with your arms fully stretched out and your feet a few inches off the ground, be sure to hold for 3-5 seconds. This ensures you're targeting your lower back, hamstrings, and back to the fullest potential. </p><h2>Kickbacks</h2><p>Kickbacks are a great workout for your lower half. While on all fours, this motion calls for you to kick back your legs one at a time. You can either go back and forth with this exercise or hold it in the "kickback" position for a few seconds to place more tension on your lower body and rest your balance. </p><figure><img title="Kickbacks" src="IMG/BB1jxiAR_kickbacks.jpg" alt="Kickbacks"><figcaption><em>Kickbacks.

Laying on your back, this exercise requires you to raise your legs in short bursts back and forth. It is best performed in time intervals of 30 seconds (or higher). The only thing that should be moving in this motion is your legs, placing a heavy emphasis on your core. </p></main>
