    <main><h1>The 9 Highest Protein Nuts to Snack on Daily</h1><p>All nuts have it, but these varieties are especially high in protein.</p><p>There’s a reason that nuts—all types of nuts—are considered superfoods by nutrition experts. In fact, there are <em>many</em> reasons for their reputation as some of the healthiest foods you can eat every day. Nuts of all varieties are high in healthy fats that support heart and brain health. They’re excellent sources of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, too.</p><p>Nuts (and nut butters) are also impressive sources of plant protein, providing a boost of satiating, cell-repairing, muscle- and tissue-building protein with each handful. When you want to add protein to anything from snacks to salads to breakfast on the go, nuts are a sure-fire way to load up on this vital macronutrient. All types of nuts are tiny packages of protein—but if you’re curious about how to get the most bang for your buck at the grocery store, we've ranked the top, highest protein nuts to eat.</p><h2>High Protein Nuts, Per 1-Ounce Serving</h2><p>Everyone's daily protein needs will be different, based on a variety of lifestyle and genetic factors. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans generally recommend consuming 46 grams of protein daily for the average woman, and 56 grams of protein per day for the average man. But the more active you are, the more protein your body requires. (Here's how to calculate your personal, daily, ideal protein needs.)</p><p>Based on nutrition data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the following is a ranking of nuts that offer the most protein per one-ounce serving of each.</p><h2>Peanuts</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Real Simple" src="IMG/BB1j7Yhh_high_protein_nuts_bowl_of_peanuts_on_pink_background.jpg" alt="High protein nuts: bowl of peanuts on pink background"><figcaption><em>Getty Images. Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>7.31 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Peanuts are technically legumes, but they're often considered nuts due to their nut-like nutritional profile, taste, and texture. This beloved ballpark and bar snack is an excellent source of protein. In fact, an ounce-sized handful of peanuts gets you more protein than one large egg! Peanut butter is also a stand-out protein source, so you can definitely keep your PB&Js.</p><p><strong>Peanut Recipes:</strong></p><ul><li>Pork and Peanut Lettuce Wraps</li><li>Thai Peanut Butter Ramen</li><li>Make-Ahead Oatmeal Peanut Butter Bars</li></ul><h2>Almonds</h2><p><strong>6.01 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Almonds are bursting with healthy nutrients and functional benefits. They're also one of the highest-protein nuts you can eat. Plus, they boast unsaturated fats, gut-supporting prebiotic fiber, and a range of micronutrients, including magnesium, vitamin E, copper, and phosphorous. Whether you eat them by the handful, season and roast them for a light hors d'oeuvres, blend them into pesto, or enjoy almond butter on toast, adding almonds to your meals and snacks gives you a super boost of protein and micronutrients.</p><p><strong>Almond Recipes</strong></p><ul><li>Nutty Superfood Breakfast Bites</li><li>Almond-Crusted Chicken With Arugula Salad</li><li>Broccolini With Lemon and Smoked Almonds</li></ul><h2>Pistachios</h2><p><strong>5.73 grams</strong> <strong>of protein</strong></p><p>Pistachio nuts, which are actually the edible seeds of the pistachio tree, are delicious in both sweet and savory recipes, from gelato to pesto to salads. And among its nut cousins, shelled pistachios are extremely high in protein—what's more, unlike other types of tree nuts, they are a complete protein source. This means pistachios contain not just some, but all essential nine amino acids, in addition to an impressive number of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals (or plant compounds). All animal proteins are complete proteins, but only a few plant foods are complete proteins (others include soybeans, quinoa, edible algae, and hempseed).</p><p><strong>Pistachio Recipes</strong></p><ul><li>Green Risotto With Pistachio Pesto</li><li>Spiced Sweet Potato Soup With Pistachio Dukkah</li><li>Lemon-Pistachio Bars</li></ul><h2>Cashews</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Real Simple" src="IMG/BB1j7VSe_high_protein_nuts_bowl_of_cashews_on_yellow_background.jpg" alt="High protein nuts: bowl of cashews on yellow background"><figcaption><em>Getty Images. Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>5.16 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Who doesn't love an order of flavorful cashew chicken, or snacking on roasted cashews with a cocktail in the other hand? Cashews tend to be higher in fats than the nut varieties discussed above—which is is likely why they're <em>so</em> tasty—but they also contain around 5 grams of protein per ounce. And that's why they're not just tasty, but filling and satisfying to boot. Beyond snacking on them straight from the container, blend cashews into smoothies, dips, sauces, and dressings for creaminess—without adding any dairy-based cream or cheese.</p><p><strong>Cashew Recipes</strong></p><ul><li>Cashew “Ricotta”</li><li>Zucchini Pesto Pasta</li><li>Cashew-Cauliflower Soup</li></ul><h2>Walnuts</h2><p><strong>4.31 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Walnuts don't just look like miniature models of brains, they're actually packed with brain-supporting nutrients and cognition-boosting properties, including omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and, of course, protein. They're also an excellent food to eat to support immunity, heart health, gut health, and more. If you've never had a salad topped with goat cheese and toasted walnuts, you're in for a real treat.</p><p><strong>Walnut Recipes</strong></p><ul><li>Honey-Paprika Walnuts</li><li>Walnut Energy Bars</li><li>Creamy Walnut Pasta With Thyme</li></ul><h2>Hazelnuts</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Real Simple" src="IMG/BB1j7Ril_high_protein_nuts_bowl_of_shelled_hazelnuts_on_green_background.jpg" alt="High protein nuts: bowl of shelled hazelnuts on green background"><figcaption><em>Getty Images. Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong> 4.25 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Hazelnuts might be most renowned for their starring role in Nutella—an iconic chocolate-hazelnut spread that's hard to resist. But this distinctive, flavorful nut is itself something to marvel at, offering over 4 grams of protein in an ounce. Yes, hazelnuts make any dessert mouthwatering, but don't forget to add these beauties to salads, pastas, grain bowls, sweet potatoes, trail mixes, and more. You won't be sorry—for the crunch, the taste, or the hit of plant protein.</p><p><strong>Hazelnut Recipes</strong></p><ul><li>Chocolate “Salami” With Hazelnuts and Figs</li><li>Gnocchi and Sweet Potatoes With Hazelnuts</li><li>Winter Citrus With Nut and Honey Crunch</li></ul><h2>Brazil Nuts</h2><p><strong>4.01 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Clocking in <em>just</em> behind hazelnuts in the protein department, Brazil nuts also deserve a moment to shine. Not only are they fueled with hearty plant protein, but they're one of the richest natural sources of selenium, a trace mineral with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that's fundamental to several body systems and health benefits, including immunity and mental health.</p><p><strong>Brazil Nut Recipe</strong></p><ul><li>Coffee-Glazed Nuts</li></ul><h2>Pine Nuts</h2><p><strong>3.88 grams of protein</strong></p><p>Good things really do come in small packages! Pine nuts have a reputation for being extremely delicious (especially when roasted/toasted), but also for being expensive and high in fats. It's not entirely untrue—so you may personally opt to save pine nuts for occasional indulgences. But pine nuts offer the good kind of fats. These little guys aren't just great sources of protein, they're also high in a specific, healthy fatty acid, pinolenic acid, which "studies indicate...has potential benefits...for chronic inflammatory and immune diseases as well as metabolic disorders," according to research published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences.</p><p><strong>Pine Nut Recipes</strong></p><ul><li>Universal Pesto Recipe</li><li>Garlicky Green Beans With Pine Nuts</li><li>Whole-Wheat Pasta With Chard and Pine Nuts</li></ul><h2>Pecans</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Real Simple" src="IMG/BB1j82Fx_high_protein_nuts_bowl_of_pecans_on_dark_blue_background.jpg" alt="High protein nuts: bowl of pecans on dark blue background"><figcaption><em>Getty Images.

This nut is lower in protein compared to other nut options, but the humble pecan is still a solid source of plant protein while also providing around 3 grams of fiber, heart-healthy monounsaturated fat, copper, manganese, zinc, thiamin, and more life-supporting nutrients.</p></main>
