    <main><h1>I’m a Fitness Instructor With Stage 4 Colon Cancer: What I Want Women to Know About Their Health</h1><h2>Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide</h2><p>According to a study published by the American Cancer Society (ACS), colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Despite continued overall declines of CRC, more people are being diagnosed with it at a younger age, at a more advanced stage, and in the left colon/rectum.</p><figure><img title="Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide" src="IMG/BB1iaXeh_colon_cancer_is_the_second_leading_cause_of_cancer_related_deaths_worldwide.jpg" alt="Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide"><figcaption><em>Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

In early 2023, the ACS “reported that 20% of diagnoses in 2019 were in patients under age 55, which is about double the rate in 1995,” according to Yale Medicine. Unfortunately, nobody knows for sure why colorectal cancer numbers are rising in young people.</p><h2>You are your first line of defense for your health</h2><p>You may be someone who looks up every single symptom you may be feeling on any given day. More often than not, it’s probably nothing, but remember, you are your first line of defense for your health. You know your body better than anyone else, and if something feels off or not right, it’s up to you to investigate further until you get some answers. Do not be afraid to wear that detective hat or even feel like a hypochondriac at times—it may save your life.</p><figure><img title="You are your first line of defense for your health" src="IMG/BB1iaULj_you_are_your_first_line_of_defense_for_your_health.jpg" alt="You are your first line of defense for your health"><figcaption><em>You are your first line of defense for your health.

These included pelvic pain, frequent urinary tract infections, and more serious signs like blood in her stools. She also knew something was off when she experienced bouts of extreme fatigue. Each of these symptoms could be written off as a one-time anomaly, but Sukay continued to pay close attention to how her body felt. She acted accordingly by booking multiple doctor appointments until they got down to the bottom of her health issues. Remember to pay attention to and trust your own body. Having peace of mind means so much more than waiting too long and wishing you would have booked that doctor’s appointment sooner.</p><h2>Know what signs to look for</h2><p>It can be hard to know what red flags are showing up when you don’t know what to look for in the first place, but according to the ACS, some symptoms of colorectal cancer are abdominal pain, blood in your stool, change in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss.</p><h2>Don’t be afraid to get tested at a younger age</h2><p>According to the ACS, the recommended colonoscopy screening age is 45, but if you have a family history of colorectal cancer or other signs and symptoms that are exhibited at an earlier age, don’t be afraid to consider screening earlier. You may also want to explore other options for overall health screenings. Always be sure to speak with your healthcare team and insurance providers to see what options would work best for you.</p><h2>If you're getting different answers, keep asking tough questions and seek more doctors</h2><p>Over six months, Sukay saw five different types of doctors and specialists spanning from gynecology to urology to gastroenterology, all providing her with different diagnoses. Everything from interstitial cystitis to internal hemorrhoids to a potential bladder infection were deemed the culprits for her pain. A few doctors even said she simply needed pelvic floor therapy. “There was a clear theme—there was no one theme,” says Sukay. “The guidance [I was getting] did not feel like the right treatment for the pain that I felt.” </p><p>This is why Sukay wishes more women would know to keep seeing more doctors if something feels off. What most doctors thought were pains related to being a woman and the reproductive system proved to be something far more: stage four colon cancer. “Trust your intuition. If you are not getting answers that feel like the right answers, be relentless with questions. Ask doctors what else could this potentially be related to and if it makes sense to see another specialist they can refer you to.”</p><h2>Avoid googling things</h2><p>Although it may be tempting to do your own online research, Sukay says it’s helpful not to Google things. “The stats can seem against you, so to stay positive I tried really hard not to read about survival rates, how hard cancer can be, etc.” Of course, this is way easier said than done. But if you can abstain or at least limit online research, it may be better for your overall mental health and emotional well-being. “Trust what the doctors say,” Sukay says. “The docs told me this was beatable, so that is the only information I prioritized.”</p><h2>Continue asking questions and be proactive during treatment</h2><p>It’s always good to ask questions at the beginning of any health journey, but don’t stop there. Although her healthcare team is an amazing group of esteemed doctors, Sukay has found that she still needs to be proactive in asking questions, because you don’t know what you don’t know. “For instance, I was able to switch one of my prescribed treatment drugs to avoid an unwanted side effect of that drug. I did not know that I had a choice to avoid the unwanted side effects, but through a series of questions on my part and then a discussion with my team, I was able to have a voice in my treatment.”</p><h2>Use your resources</h2><p>When it comes to any health diagnosis, Sukay says to use your resources. Friends who work in healthcare, health insurance programs, and company critical care support programs can all be integral in a health journey. “Tap your network! Your health insurance may offer a special cancer support program. They can assist with health questions, specialist and medical appointment information, health and diet goals,” Sukay says. Check if your employer has any employee assistance programs to help with critical care situations.</p><h2>Don’t feel like you are burdening people by asking for support</h2><p>Many people, like Sukay, pride themselves on being highly independent and do not want to inconvenience others. But dealing with your health is one of those times in life when you have to embrace vulnerability to come out stronger and lean on your support network for assistance, love, and care, according to Sukay.</p><p> “When people offer to help, take them up on it,” she says. If people are not reaching out, Sukay advises giving yourself permission and grace to reach out and ask for support when needed. And don’t forget to show your gratitude. “Thank your friends and family repeatedly for being there for you. Nobody knows how much the little things mean until you actually go through [a health] journey. Remind the people in your life how much their support matters and helps!”</p><figure><img title="Don’t feel like you are burdening people by asking for support" src="IMG/BB1iaXeY_dont_feel_like_you_are_burdening_people_by_asking_for_support.jpg" alt="Don’t feel like you are burdening people by asking for support"><figcaption><em>Don’t feel like you are burdening people by asking for support.

Even if it seems innocuous and manageable on your own, the added support will take the edge off. Whether they make sure to ask additional questions, take notes so you do not forget anything the doctor said, or simply hold your hand through treatment, this help can be invaluable.</p><h2>Embrace as many things that make you feel like yourself</h2><p>Even during challenging times, it can be helpful to do as many things that make you feel good about yourself as possible, Sukay says. Think: ordinary routine things that make you feel most like you. “On days when you feel good, try to keep your normal routine,” says Sukay. Maybe you love walking with a morning coffee, doing a morning workout (if your doctor clears it), working at your job (again, if your doctor clears it), visiting with a friend, or unwinding at the end of the day with a good show. “Get the manicure, the massage, the Botox, the wig,” says Sukay. “Do everything that makes you feel pampered, pretty, and restored because there will be days when you do not look or feel like yourself, so double down on the days where you can!”</p><figure><img title="Embrace as many things that make you feel like yourself" src="IMG/BB1ib1oO_embrace_as_many_things_that_make_you_feel_like_yourself.jpg" alt="Embrace as many things that make you feel like yourself"><figcaption><em>Embrace as many things that make you feel like yourself.

For Sukay, transitioning to a much more relaxed and forgiving routine was a massive adjustment. “I do not like to sit still and movement is my top way to release stress, but I have had to learn to exercise new muscles during this experience—my mind and my spirituality!” Take this time to feel productive and or challenged in new ways. Learn something new, practice relaxation, or catch up on things you have historically put off, like finishing some books you started or redecorating your home.</p><h2>Hygiene in the hospital counts</h2><p>This may not seem super health-related, but maintaining proper hygiene, even in the hospital, counts! As simple as it sounds, it is important to continue to brush or comb your hair while in the hospital. Sukay had her hair in a bun for days and ended up having to chop off her long locks from a massive knot that formed, so if you want to save your hair and still feel good about yourself in other ways (like applying skincare products) keep up that hygiene routine even in the hospital.</p><h2>Your body is fighting hard for you, even when you feel like you are doing nothing</h2><p>Whether you are going through treatment, gearing up for surgery, or recovering from surgery, remember that even on the days you feel like you’re doing nothing, your body is fighting so hard and using every fiber of your being to heal. So much is happening on the inside, which is all for you and the betterment of your health and future self to come back stronger than ever.</p><h2>Give back</h2><p>If it feels appropriate to you, give back. “For me, giving back means creating awareness about colon cancer, my personal journey, and showing up for others in a deeper way than what I would have understood how to do prior to my own personal experience,” shares Sukay. “My hope is that through awareness I can help others with prevention or early detection of possible health afflictions.”</p></main>
