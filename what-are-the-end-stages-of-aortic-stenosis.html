    <main><h1>What Are the End Stages of Aortic Stenosis?</h1><p><p>A number of patients are asymptomatic</p><strong>Medically reviewed by Anisha Shah, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Anisha Shah, MD</strong><p>Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve between the heart's left ventricle and the aorta narrows, restricting blood flow. Aortic stenosis can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the symptoms.</p><p>Often, aortic stenosis causes no symptoms or only mild symptoms until it becomes severe, which is a serious condition that may involve end-of-life considerations if surgical treatment is not an option.</p><p>This article discusses end-stage aortic stenosis facts, symptoms, treatment, prognosis, and advance care planning.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oa5e1_a_senior_woman_covering_her_eyes_due_to_a_headache.jpg" alt="A senior woman covering her eyes due to a headache"><figcaption><em>Halfpoint Images / Getty Images.

However, it most commonly occurs from calcium buildup or scarring in the aortic valve due to age.</p><p> <h2>End-Stage Aortic Stenosis: The Facts</h2><p>There are some facts you should know about end-stage aortic stenosis, such as heart damage, risk factors, and prognosis.</p><h3>Heart Damage</h3><p>In end-stage aortic stenosis, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood because the aortic valve is narrowed. This can cause the left ventricle wall to thicken, affecting the heart's ability to supply blood to the rest of the body.</p><p>Without treatment, aortic stenosis can lead to heart failure, a severe condition in which the heart doesn't pump well enough to supply the body with enough blood and oxygen.</p><h3>Risk Groups</h3><p>Aortic stenosis is a progressive condition, but the reasons it progresses are mainly unknown. Risk factors that can be associated with quicker progression or aortic stenosis include:</p><ul><li>Advanced age</li><li>Body mass index (BMI)</li><li>Tobacco use</li><li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li><li>High cholesterol</li><li>Metabolic syndrome (a combination of conditions that can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes)</li></ul><h3>Prognosis at Diagnosis</h3><p>Without valve replacement surgery, end-stage aortic stenosis without symptoms (asymptomatic) has a poor long-term survival rate similar to that of some cancers. The one-year survival rate in patients younger than 70 years old with severe aortic stenosis without symptoms is 46% at three years and 37% at four years. The four-year survival rate in patients over 70 years old with severe aortic stenosis without symptoms is 16%.</p><p>The average life expectancy for aortic stenosis with symptoms (such as shortness of breath or chest pain) is one to two years without treatment. About one-third of patients with aortic stenosis do not receive valve replacement surgery, which is the only effective treatment for the condition.</p><h2>Symptoms (or No Symptoms) of End-Stage Aortic Stenosis</h2><p><p>Aortic stenosis creates a unique heart murmur that changes as the disease progresses. The murmur can typically be heard when a healthcare provider listens to the heart with a stethoscope during a physical exam.</p><p>About one-fourth of patients with severe aortic stenosis don't have any symptoms. However, symptoms might be underreported in older adult patients because of other conditions they may have, such as memory issues, degenerative arthritis, and poor mobility.</p><p>Severe aortic stenosis can occur without symptoms for years. Unless treated with valve replacement surgery, the likelihood of having no symptoms from severe aortic stenosis is 82% after one year, 67% after two years, and 33% after five years.</p><p>Symptoms of aortic stenosis often don't occur until there is severe damage to the heart valve. Symptoms of end-stage aortic stenosis include:</p><ul><li>Chest pain or tightness</li><li>Rapid or fluttering heartbeat</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Dizziness or faintness</li><li>Increased exhaustion after activity</li><li>Swollen ankles and feet</li><li>Difficulty sleeping</li></ul><h2>Treatment During End-Stage Aortic Stenosis</h2><p>Valve replacement surgery is the only treatment that can improve survival and quality of life in those with end-stage aortic stenosis. It is performed through open-heart surgical aortic valve replacement surgery (SAVR) or minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).</p><p>With TAVR, a new valve is placed inside the diseased valve through a catheter. The procedure has fewer risks and a quicker recovery time than open heart valve replacement surgery. TAVR was first performed only in those with aortic stenosis who were too high risk for open heart surgery, but it is now performed in lower-risk patients as well.</p><p>Older patients who are frail or have other conditions such as lung disease, coronary artery disease, or renal (kidney) dysfunction might not be candidates for valve replacement surgery. In these cases, palliative care (specialized care aimed at relieving symptoms) can be used alongside medications and other methods to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.</p><h2>Specialists Involved and Hospitalization</h2><p>If you have end-stage aortic stenosis, your care team will usually include:</p><ul><li>A primary care physician</li><li>A general cardiologist (heart doctor)</li><li>A cardiac sonographer (a specialist who takes ultrasound images of the heart)</li></ul><p>If you have valve replacement surgery, it will be performed in a hospital. There, specialists who treat you can include:</p><ul><li>An interventional cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon</li><li>A valve clinic coordinator to help you navigate treatment</li><li>A cardiovascular anesthesiologist (gives anesthetic medicines during heart surgery)</li><li>Cardiovascular nurses</li></ul><h2>Tips for Caregivers</h2><p>One of the challenges in managing end-stage aortic stenosis is ensuring that medical treatment is balanced with supportive care.</p><p>At the time of diagnosis of end-stage aortic stenosis, advance care planning and palliative care should be discussed. Even if a patient is a candidate for valve replacement surgery, it's possible the surgery will not go as planned or have complications.</p><p>Palliative care is specialized care that can play an essential role in patients with end-stage aortic stenosis at the time of diagnosis and throughout the disease. Advance care planning and palliative care can help:</p><ul><li>Reduce caregiver and patient anxiety</li><li>Manage patient symptoms</li><li>Help caregivers follow patient wishes</li><li>Improve communication between patients, caregivers, and families</li><li>Provide psychosocial, spiritual, and bereavement support</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Because aortic stenosis often doesn't have symptoms, especially in its early stages, you might not know you have the condition until it's severe. End-stage aortic stenosis can cause serious heart damage and has a limited life expectancy unless valve replacement surgery is performed. Advance care planning should be discussed to benefit the patient and caregivers when end-stage aortic stenosis is diagnosed.</p>
