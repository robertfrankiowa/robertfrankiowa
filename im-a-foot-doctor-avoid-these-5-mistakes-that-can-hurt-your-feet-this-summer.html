    <main><h1>I'm a foot doctor. Avoid these 5 mistakes that can hurt your feet this summer</h1><p>Summer is officially here, which means warmer weather and releasing our feet from their closed-toe confines. But as people swap boots for sandals and spend more time outside, foot doctors are urging caution. </p><p>The summer can be hard on the feet and present a number of challenges, which is why it tends to be a busy time for podiatry offices. Taking extra foot care steps can go a long way.</p><p>We spoke to foot doctors about common foot problems and mistakes they see people making in the summer, and how to prevent them to keep the feet healthy all summer long.</p><h2><strong>Going barefoot in the wrong places</strong></h2><p>The nice weather may seem like a great excuse to live footloose and fancy free, and ditch shoes altogether. However, there are several reasons to limit or avoid going barefoot in the summer, according to experts.</p><p>There's the obvious: hot asphalt or pavement can burn the soles of the feet, and running around a backyard without shoes can result in cuts, puncture wounds, or insect bites.</p><p>Walking barefoot around public pools and locker rooms can expose the feet to fungal and bacterial pathogens, Dr. Deena Horn, a podiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, tells TODAY.com. "These can live on the surfaces of locker rooms and pool decks, so you’re exposed when you go barefoot,” says Horn.</p><p>Horn says she tends to see more foot fungus in the summer, namely athlete’s foot, a type of ringworm infection. Plantar warts, which are caused by HPV, can live on these surfaces and enter through breaks in the skin of the soles of the feet. Bacterial foot infections are less common, says Horn, but germs like staphylococcus aureus can also enter through wounds on the feet.</p><p>Try to wear sandals around public pools, says Horn, and always keep them on in locker rooms. Avoid walking barefoot if you have any wounds on your feet. </p><p>What about the beach? “If you’re going to be swimming in water where you can’t see what you’re stepping on, or there are a lot of rocks and shells, it makes sense to have water shoes on,” Dr. Holly Johnson, a foot and ankle surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery, tells TODAY.com.</p><p>Water shoes are a must if you’re swimming in water with coral or critters lurking. “We see coral cut the feet, and I pull sea urchin spines out of people’s feet more than you’d think,” says Horn.</p><h2>Sporting unsupportive shoes</h2><p>"We see a lot of issues with increased activity with poor shoe gear, such as stress fractures, and we see a lot of plantar fasciitis and heel pain," Dr. Heather Schaefbauer, a podiatric foot and ankle surgery specialist with the Mayo Clinic Health System, tells TODAY.com.</p><p>Plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the feet, per the Mayo Clinic. It's common in the summer, when people are doing activities without sneakers or supportive shoes, says Horn. </p><p>“You can develop pain within minutes of walking. ... In less than a mile, you can develop issues that can last for a long time,” Horn adds. People are also more prone to accidents, slips and trips when wearing more casual shoes or sandals, Johnson notes.</p><p>Many of these issues can be prevented by wearing the right shoes with a sturdy base, arch support and cushioning, the experts note. "It's very important if you're doing any high impact activities or exercises to wear a supportive shoe to prevent injuries," says Schaefbauer.</p><p>Even if you just plan to be walking for longer than usual, opt for comfortable sneakers or supportive sandals, says Horn. </p><h2><strong>Forgetting sunscreen on the feet</strong></h2><p>When it comes to sunscreen, the feet are commonly missed. But just like any other part of the body, the skin of the feet can get seriously burned when exposed to ultraviolet rays. “We’ll see second- and even third-degree sunburns on the top of the feet,” says Horn.</p><p>When applying sunscreen, slather your body from head to toe — literally, says Johnson. Apply a generous amount of broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) to the feet, and don’t forget to reapply every two hours or after swimming. </p><p>Even if your feet get less sun, it’s still possible for skin cancers to develop on any part of the foot, even the soles, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. This includes melanoma, the most deadly type of skin cancer.</p><p>People often forget to look on their feet for signs of skin cancer, which can allow the cancer to spread before it’s detected. The experts recommend checking every part of the feet for any suspicious or changing moles — aka the ABCDEs of melanoma.</p><h2>Slacking on foot hygiene </h2><p>Another mistake the experts see people make in the summer is skipping foot care and hygiene. </p><p>Athlete’s foot and toenail fungus tend to flare in the summer, as they thrive in warm, moist environments — like a sneaker after walking on a hot day. "People who have damp, sweaty feet are more likely to get a fungal infection," says Horn. </p><p>On the other hand, exposing feet to the elements can worsen dryness. “Cracking of the heels we see more in the summer, just because you have drier feet, and you’re walking in sandals, so the heel pad is moving,” says Horn. </p><p>Going barefoot or wearing flip flops makes it easier for the feet to pick up dirt and germs. “Try to have good foot hygiene,” says Horn. Always wash your feet thoroughly, especially before bed.</p><p>The experts also recommend keeping the feet dry and cool. "Change your socks more often if you're a sweaty person, and use disinfectant spray in your shoes to avoid too much microbes, fungus and bacteria growing," says Horn.</p><p>"Make sure to moisturize your feet when you're inside, which will help to prevent the cracking and peeling," says Horn, adding that she recommends using a urea-containing cream for dry heels.</p><h2>Becoming too active too quickly</h2><p>During the summer, many people suddenly become more active. Going straight from a sedentary lifestyle to an action-packed vacation outdoors, for example, can be very hard on the feet. </p><p>"I think people are inspired to go outside as the weather gets nicer, but they're not in proper shape ... and suffering foot injuries related to increased activity they’re not conditioned for,” Johnson adds. </p><p>“We see more patients with injuries related to outdoor activities such as running, hiking and sand sports,” says Schaefbauer. These injuries include Achilles tendinitis, tendon ruptures, plantar fasciitis and stress fractures.</p><p>Even walking too much can cause overuse injuries. "The root of all evil for the foot is a tight calf muscle," says Horn. "When people are walking a lot, their hamstrings become tight and the calf muscles become tight," Horn explains. </p><p>Always make sure to stretch these muscles before and after activities such as walking, running or hiking. If you aren't used to a certain activity level, try to prepare your body first. “Many of these issues can be prevented by gradually increasing activity level and trying to warm up prior,” says Schaefbauer.</p><p>"It is important to see a doctor if you have had any type of injury where you are unable to bear weight or are limping," says Schaefbauer. If you have any sudden foot pain that does not resolve with rest or persists beyond a week or two, it's probably time to get checked out.</p></main>
