    <main><h1>7 Healthy Carbs That Can Help You Lose Weight</h1><p>With the rise of popular eating patterns like keto, you might think you need to avoid carbs completely if you want to lose weight. Yet many healthy carb foods can fit into a balanced diet.</p><p>So, what are these “good carbs”? Let’s take a closer look at seven good carbs for weight loss, according to registered dietitians.</p><h2>1. Quinoa</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>39.4 grams (g) in a 1-cup serving size, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</p><p>With over 8 g of protein in each cooked cup, per the USDA, quinoa doubles as a good source of protein and carbs. Research shows that protein can promote weight loss by boosting metabolism and increasing feelings of fullness.</p><p>Quinoa also contains a small amount of natural sugars in each serving. Natural sugars are found in high-carb foods like fruits, starches, and dairy products. Foods high in natural sugars also offer a host of other beneficial nutrients without the same negative health effects caused by the added sugars found in sweets and processed foods, according to research.</p><p>“[Quinoa] is also high in fiber, which helps with managing appetite and can aid in weight loss,” says Dalia Beydoun, a registered dietitian and certified nutrition support clinician based in Newport Beach, California, echoing a research review. Interestingly, another study found that eating quinoa for 28 days can lead to weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and increased satiety in 29 adults with prediabetes. For this reason, making quinoa a regular part of your rotation might be an especially good option if you’re looking to lose weight or keep your appetite in check.</p><p>Quinoa works well in sweet and savory dishes alike. Use it to add extra protein to your morning meal with this Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl or give this One-Pan Quinoa Mexican Skillet a try for an easy weeknight dinner.</p><h2>2. Oats</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>28.1 g in a 1-cup serving size, per the USDA</p><p>Although they may be high in carbs, oats can help make weight loss much easier, says Su-Nui Escobar, a doctor of clinical nutrition and registered dietitian nutritionist who is based in Miami. “First, they are high in soluble fiber, which can help you control your hunger levels,” says Dr. Escobar. A research review that examines fiber’s effect on post-meal energy intake supports this notion. </p><p>“[Oats] can also lower your blood sugar, which, when elevated, can increase food cravings,” says Escobar, which is backed by research on oats and blood sugar control. Not only that, but a research review suggests oats may support weight management by enhancing the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which regulate your metabolism.</p><p>Try whipping up a batch of overnight oats for a quick, grab-and-go breakfast. You can also mix oats into meatballs, veggie burgers, or energy bites for an added boost of protein and fiber.</p><h2>3. Farro</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>44 g in a 1-cup serving size, per the USDA</p><p>While it may not be as well-known as other whole grains, farro deserves a spot on your shopping list. “Farro is a type of ancient grain that’s high in fiber and protein, both of which help in feeling full and satisfied,” says Beydoun. The satiety-boosting effects of these nutrients is also noted in a research review on fiber and other research on protein. “It also has a chewy texture and nutty flavor that can make meals more satisfying.” According to a meta-analysis, eating whole grains like farro could reduce hunger and desire to eat while increasing ratings of satiety and fullness — all of which could translate to weight loss.</p><p>“Farro can be a great substitute for rice in certain dishes, or it can serve as a base for salads,” says Beydoun. You can also make White Bean and Farro Soup, which pairs farro with other nutritious ingredients like sweet potatoes, onions, celery, and tomatoes for a hearty dinner option.</p><h2>4. Beans</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>39.8 g in a 1-cup serving size of black beans, per the USDA</p><p>“Beans are one of my favorite ways to add healthy carbohydrates to my patients’ (and my own) diet,” says Escobar. “Beans provide many nutrients beyond carbohydrates and can make meals more interesting; they are a great source of fiber, protein, and other vitamins and minerals” — which research bears out. Not only that, but beans could also help with weight loss. In fact, one study analyzed the diets of 246 primarily non-Hispanic white, adult women and found that those who consumed more beans tended to have less body fat and smaller waists.</p><p>Try giving your favorite recipes a plant-based twist by swapping in black beans or kidney beans. Or break out a can of chickpeas and try this Chickpea Salad Sandwich, followed by these Chocolate Chip Chickpea Blondies for dessert.</p><h2>5. Berries</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>21.5 g in a 1-cup serving size of blueberries, per the USDA</p><p>“Berries are high in fiber and antioxidants while being low in calories, making them an excellent choice for weight loss,” says Beydoun. They are especially rich in antioxidants called anthocyanins, according to a review. Anthocyanins are compounds that could reduce inflammation caused by obesity and help balance the bacteria in the gut.</p><p>“[Berries] can help you feel full and provide a natural sweetness, making them a great addition to your yogurt bowl, oatmeal, or smoothies,” says Beydoun. Plus, berries can fit into a wide range of recipes. For example, this Amaretto Ricotta and Berries recipe pairs fresh berries with high-protein ricotta for a quick and easy way to satisfy your sweet tooth.</p><h2>6. Lentils</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>38.6 g in a 1-cup serving size, per the USDA</p><p>Beydoun says lentils may be high in carbs, but they’re also an excellent source of protein and fiber. “This combination can help stabilize blood sugar, reduce hunger, and thereby support your weight loss goals,” she says, which is also noted in a research review. Plus, making lentils a mainstay on your menu might also offer some other added health perks. In fact, a study found that regular consumption of lentils could keep blood sugar steady and lower levels of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol.</p><p>These BBQ Lentils make a great addition to sandwiches topped with veggies and slaw. Lentils can also be used in dishes such as curries, soups, and salads.</p><h2>7. Apples</h2><p><strong>Carb count: </strong>14.8 g in a 1-cup serving size, per the USDA</p><p>“Many people are scared of the sugar content of fruits and limit themselves to berries,” says Escobar. Apples are an awesome option. Although a medium apple contains around 23 g of carbs and some natural sugars, it also packs a whopping 4 grams of fiber, per the USDA. What’s more, research in both humans and animals consistently shows that adding apples to your diet could lead to weight loss.</p><p>While apples can be a simple snack as is, you can also pair them with cheese, Greek yogurt, or even peanut butter for a sweet treat. “If you have a sweet tooth, it is much easier to stick to healthy eating for weight loss if you have alternatives to that piece of candy you are craving!” says Escobar.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Whether you’re trying to lose weight, improve your health, or simply eat better, you don’t always need to steer clear of carbs. Plenty of good carbs can be enjoyed as part of a balanced meal plan, including the options above. Remember to fill your plate with nutritious whole foods whenever possible to ensure you also include lots of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals in your diet.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
