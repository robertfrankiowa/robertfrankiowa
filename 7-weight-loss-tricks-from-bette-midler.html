    <main><h1>7 Weight Loss Tricks From Bette Midler</h1><p>Bette Midler is 77 and still giving us so much entertainment. The <i>Hocus Pocus</i> actress makes a point of staying busy, whether through her work or just her many charitable volunteer activities. "I'm very involved in projects that help clean up New York parks," she says. "It makes me feel young and feel good to give back to the next generation. They deserve a clean, beautiful park to dream their dreams. Getting involved at every age is helpful because it's a way to stay engaged in the world." Well said! Here are 7 ways Midler keeps her weight in check—while staying healthy and happy.</p><h2>1. Lots of Dancing</h2><p>Dancing is one of Midler's favorite ways to stay active while having a good time. "The main thing is you have to move," she says. "Dancing is one of my favorite ways to move. You can do it anywhere. You don't need to leave the house. Just put on your favorite music. Dancing really breaks a sweat, plus it's fun."</p><h2>2. Lots of Walking</h2><p>Walking is another way Midler stays in shape. "A pair of studies from the University of Exeter found that a 15-minute walk can curb cravings for chocolate and even reduce the amount of chocolate you eat in stressful situations," say the experts at Harvard Health. "And the latest research confirms that walking can reduce cravings and intake of a variety of sugary snacks."</p><figure><img title="2.

Starring on Broadway</h2><p>Midler lost 30 pounds in the run up to her starring role as Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical <i>Hello, Dolly!</i> on Broadway. "It's a very, very tough schedule and I'm a woman of a certain age," she joked. "I'm at death's door so I wasn't really keen to put these dancing shoes on again. But [producer Scott Rudin] made it sound as though I had missed something in life and I would be a changed person from this experience and indeed I have been."</p><figure><img title="3.

Mindful About Alcohol</h2><p>Midler is adamant about being aware of how the body changes as a result of lifestyle choices, like drinking alcohol. The actress believes both men and women should take care of themselves. "You should stop beating your hair into submission, even if you don't like it," she says. "Everyone should exfoliate, every day, even guys… More than two drinks a day will ruin your skin. And if you don't have a full-length mirror, you're going to get fat. Period."</p><figure><img title="4. Mindful About Alcohol" src="IMG/AA1dfzcg_4_mindful_about_alcohol.jpg" alt="4. Mindful About Alcohol"><figcaption><em>4.

"Pilates is a form of muscle strengthening exercise, which is well-known to be important for maintaining good health," says Lindsay Bottoms, Reader in Exercise and Health Physiology, University of Hertfordshire. "Strength training is important as it helps us prevent the slow muscle deterioration that occurs as we get older. It also increases muscle mass, which can in turn increase metabolism – which is important for maintaining a healthy weight."</p><h2>6. Learn To Love Your Body</h2><p>Midler emphasizes how important self-love and acceptance is along with working out and eating the right foods. "At the same time, you have to accept your body and learn to actually like your body," she says. "Once you decide to like your body, you stop putting stuff in it that will turn against you or that throws you out of whack. It's all about balance."</p><figure><img title="6.

"When women are together and have a bond or a sisterhood, it is very important and crucial for mental health," she says. "Women know how to lean on each other. We count on each other. We're seriously funny, which women aren't supposed to be. We're decisive. We're intensely loyal to each other, too. These are all positives."</p></main>
