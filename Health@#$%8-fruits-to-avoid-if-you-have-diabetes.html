    <main><h1>8 Fruits to Avoid if You Have Diabetes</h1><p><p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recommends that people with diabetes should include fruits in their diet. While fruits are a healthier option and can even present your risk of getting certain diseases, some fruits have a high sugar content and can spike your blood sugar levels, further worsening your diabetes.</p><p>Managing diabetes doesn’t have to be challenging. Eliminating these fruits from your diet can help you better control your blood sugar levels and manage diabetes. Consume other diabetic-friendly fruits like raspberries, blackberries, avocados, green apples, and kiwis to get essential minerals and vitamins.</p><p>Here are fruits you need to avoid if you have diabetes.</p><h2>Pineapple</h2><p>Although pineapple is high in vitamin C and fiber, it also has a lot of sugar. A cup of pineapple contains about 16 grams of sugar, and its high glycemic index can lead to a spike in blood sugar levels, making it harmful for people with diabetes. Additionally, pineapple has a high carbohydrate content, which can interfere with diabetes management.</p><figure><img title="Pineapple" src="IMG/BB1m6Wk2_pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple"><figcaption><em>Pineapple.

Although this natural fruit has a high water content, it also has a high natural sugar content. Fructose can increase blood glucose levels, further complicating diabetes management. Opting for other low-glycemic-index fruits, such as avocado, can help control your blood sugar levels and still deliver essential nutrients.</p><h2>Overripe Bananas</h2><p>Bananas are a great snack and can be filling due to their carbohydrate content. However, bananas may not be the best fruit for people with diabetes. A single medium-sized banana has 14 grams of sugar and 27 grams of carbohydrates, which can affect blood sugar levels. Although bananas have a glycemic index of 51 to 55, the moderate levels can still cause a spike in blood sugar and make it difficult to manage diabetes.</p><p>Overripe bananas have more fructose and can cause a faster increase in blood sugar. You can replace bananas with avocado or berries to keep your sugar levels under control.</p><h2>Mango</h2><p>Mangoes are delicious and great as snacks or in smoothies, but they should be approached with caution if you have diabetes. A single cup of sliced mango has 23 grams of sugar. The high sugar content can increase blood glucose levels and make it difficult to manage diabetes. Although mangoes have a moderate glycemic index of around 51, they can still cause a slight rise in blood sugar levels. Limit your serving portion to half, and eat mango as an occasional treat to manage your sugar levels.</p><figure><img title="Mango" src="IMG/BB1oS0xQ_mango.jpg" alt="Mango"><figcaption><em>Mango.

Nutritional experts recommend limiting your daily intake of papaya to a single cup.</p><figure><img title="Papaya" src="IMG/BB1oBTER_papaya.jpg" alt="Papaya"><figcaption><em>Papaya.

A 50-gram tin of dates has 25 grams of sugar, while 43 grams of raisins has 25 grams of sugar. Their high glycemic index and sugar content make them unsuitable for people with diabetes.</p><h2>Cherries</h2><p>Cherries are a delicious and convenient summer snack, but not ideal for people with diabetes. A cup of cheese has 20 grams of sugar and a glycemic index 62, which can cause a noticeable increase in blood sugar levels. The fruit has a high carbohydrate content that can lead to a noticeable blood sugar spike.</p><h2>Lychees</h2><p>Lychees are high in fructose and glucose. A serving of 100 grams of lychee has 15 grams of sugar, which can impact blood sugar levels. Lychees also have a GI index of 79, which is considered high and can cause fluctuations in blood glucose levels.</p><figure><img title="Lychees" src="IMG/BB1oBVw1_lychees.jpg" alt="Lychees"><figcaption><em>Lychees.
