    <main><h1>25 TV Characters Who Accurately Portray Mental Illness</h1><ul>          <li>                    TV characters with mental disorders offer a wide spectrum of accurate representation, breaking down barriers in popular media.            </li>          <li>                    Portrayals of mental illness help viewers open up about their struggles, destigmatizing conditions and encouraging seeking support.            </li>          <li>                    Shows like BoJack Horseman, Shameless, and Ozark provide accurate depictions that help raise awareness and open up dialogue on mental health.            </li>      </ul><p>          Mental health is a serious subject that requires a great deal of sensitivity and honesty when it comes to representation in popular media, and <strong>these TV characters with mental disorders provide a wide spectrum of representation</strong>. Many shows and movies have been criticized for their portrayal of mental health, with characters being reduced to two-dimensional clichés that promote damaging stereotypes. Contemporary media has risen to the challenge when it comes to depicting an accurate representation of mental health. Shows like <em>BoJack Horseman</em> gained critical acclaim for explorations of mental illness, as well as becoming iconic staples of popular culture.   </p><p>          Mental illness is becoming less taboo on television. Part of that is because <strong>actors and writers are vocal about seeking support for mental health themselves, and encouraging viewers to do so too. </strong>Telling serialized stories depicting how fictional characters learn to live with depression, anxiety, and more helps break down the barriers to fans talking about it. Sometimes, depictions of mental illness in media can be divisive as there can be overlapping symptoms in different illnesses, and not everyone experiences them the same way. These TV characters with mental disorders are at the forefront of opening up a dialogue.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">10 Movies Praised For Their Depiction Of Mental Health Issues</h5><p class="display-card-excerpt not one">These movies help in destigmatizing mental health issues and conditions, leaving audiences with more empathy for those who are in need of help.</p><h2>            Maria Bamford (Lady Dynamite)        </h2><h3>      Played By Maria Bamford  </h3><p>          <em>Lady Dynamite</em> is a special show because it stars Maria Bamford as herself. This is a fictionalized version of her life story and Bamford uses it as a chance to show what living as a character with mental illness is really like. The series follows Maria as<strong> she moves back to Los Angeles after spending six months in recovery for bipolar disorder. </strong>Her goal is to rebuild her life with the help of her agent (Fred Melamed) and her life coach (Ana Gasteyer), and ultimately mount a stand-up show centered around her mental breakdown.   </p><p>          Star Maria Bamford has been diagnosed in real life with Bipolar II Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  </p><p>          Thanks to her real-life experience with bipolar disorder, <strong>Bamford is able to bring a realistic look to the condition and not over-exaggerate things or make it look different from how it really is.</strong> The show also reveals how hard this is on the friends and family of a person with the condition and how it is difficult to control the destructive behavior that mania causes. <em>Lady Dynamite </em>finds humor in Maria's situation, but it is always based on truth and never makes fun of people with bipolar disorder.   </p><h2>            Ian Gallagher (Shameless)        </h2><h3>      Played By Cameron Monaghan  </h3><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1lk3Ua_ian_gallagher_looks_on_from_shameless.jpg" alt="Ian Gallagher looks on from Shameless"><figcaption><em>Ian Gallagher (Cameron Monaghan) looks on outside a house's front door in Shameless. Provided by ScreenRant</em></figcaption></figure><p>          <em>Shameless</em> is full of characters dealing with various mental illnesses, and most of them are not in treatment.<strong> Ian Gallagher has bipolar disorder, and he was receiving treatment in the series.</strong> The series shows his mood swings, from his highest of highs to the lowest of lows, with depression issues causing many of his problems on the show. Throughout the <em>Shameless</em> storylines, Ian shows how bipolar disorder can change a person, affect his emotions, and alter his outlook on the world.   </p><p>          It changes his relationship with his family, his partners, and almost everyone around him. Ian's biggest issues came when he stopped taking his medications, and it was obvious something was wrong. <strong>His actions in the series when off his meds are very accurate to what it is like to live with this mental illness.</strong> By the end of <em>Shameless</em>, the show remained a positive depiction of moving forward with a mental illness as it showed a person could still thrive in the workplace and advocate for themselves when practicing self-care.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">Shameless</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h2>            Ben Davis (Ozark)        </h2><h3>      Played By Tom Pelphrey  </h3><p>          <em>Ozark </em>doesn't get mental health conditions perfect, as seen in a variety of characters. However, one character who ended up being very accurate was Ben Davis and his bipolar disorder. <strong>Ben's actions in the series highly represent what a person with bipolar disorder goes through on a daily basis</strong> as he struggles to make it through life and make the best possible decisions while dealing with this disease. When small things caused his mood swings and bouts of crying, it was a masterclass of acting by Tom Pelphrey.   </p><p>          Tom Pelphrey received a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.  </p><p>          <em>Ozark</em> also got a lot of the little things down, such as how he grunts when frustrated or wipes back his hair when vexed. These little moments really showed what it is like to deal with bipolar disorder, even when people around them don't understand there is anything wrong. <strong>Pelphrey also worked hard to keep his facial expressions mostly devoid of energy, which is another symptom of the disorder.</strong> From the little things to the actions in the show, this might be one of the best depictions of bipolar disorder on television.   </p><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1jR7ev_ozark_poster.jpg" alt="Ozark Poster"><figcaption><em>Ozark Poster.

She had no choice, as her mother left and her father had fallen into alcoholism. Sadly, there was no one there to take care of Fiona herself. <strong>Fiona had severe depression issues, and as the series wore on, these mental health struggles continued to push her into dark places. </strong>She dealt with her family problems, and losing a job in season 9 finally caused Fiona to fall into bad habits.   </p><p>          Even when she saw what alcoholism did to her dad, Fiona began to drink more. She began to pretend to be happy when she was not and changed her perception of reality to something that she could deal with. Throughout that season, she began to lose her mental fortitude and, since she was the person who took it upon herself to care for others, she had nothing left to give to herself. Her siblings, who she helped raise, didn't even stop up to help her and Fiona eventually had to leave everything behind for her own mental well-being.   </p><h2>            Ted Lasso (Ted Lasso)        </h2><h3>      Played by Jason Sudeikis  </h3><p>          <em>Ted Lasso</em> is, above all, a comedy. It is about a former American football coach who is hired to coach a soccer team in the U.K. The owner hopes that Lasso can drive the team into a freefall, but he does the opposite and makes the team stronger. But <em>Ted Lasso</em> isn't afraid to get serious, especially when it comes to depicting the effects of mental illness on Ted himself. He is truly optimistic and leads his team to greatness by never giving up on them. However, <strong>Ted suffers panic attacks and realizes he needs help</strong>.   </p><p>          Jason Sudeikis and the <em>Ted Lasso</em> cast met with President Joe Biden to talk about mental health issues.  </p><p>          This is where the show shines, as <em>Ted Lasso</em> doesn't make a joke of Ted's anxiety issues and mental illness. Instead<strong>, it shows how therapy can be used to really help a person</strong> understand where the issues are coming from and set up plans to help deal with them. Ted actor Jason Sudeikis told <em>CNN</em>,   </p><blockquote>            <p>          <em>Myself and other people in the cast, especially the writing staff, get messages daily from people thanking them for really opening their eyes to what it means to go to therapy and what it means for someone in their own life to go to therapy </em>and just speaking about these things and taking the stigma off of any form of health whether it be nutrition or mental, emotional health.  </p>      </blockquote><h5 class="display-card-title ">Ted Lasso</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Rating</strong><h2>            Rainbow Johnson (Black-ish)        </h2><h3>      Played By Tracee Ellis Ross  </h3><p>          It's rare for sitcoms to seriously tackle any issues remotely associated with mental health without turning a stereotype into a punchline. <em>Black-ish</em>, however, has done a great job at integrating serious topics into its comedy and allowing episodes to be more dramatic than sitcoms typically would. One storyline, though it might have been shorter than some fans liked, involved <em>Black-ish's</em> <strong>Bow</strong><strong> dealing with postpartum depression after the birth of her child.</strong>   </p><p>          Audience members praised the episode for both its portrayal of Bow's struggle with her own guilt about her very real feelings and the point of view of others in the house who might not have understood what Bow was going through. <strong>Bow has become one of the best depictions of characters with postpartum depression</strong> <strong>in recent years. </strong>This was a strong storyline and touched on a serious topic in a responsible manner.   </p><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1oiUnk_black_ish_tv_series_poster.jpg" alt="Black-ish tv series poster"><figcaption><em>Black-ish tv series poster.

Season 2, specifically, pivots to highlight <strong>Gretchen being diagnosed with depression</strong>. The character explains that her "<em>brain is broken</em>" at one point, highlighting her own feelings of inadequacy.   </p><p>          The reveal of her diagnosis allowed viewers to see how some of her behavior was rooted in the feelings that resulted from her depression. While some fans didn't enjoy the show taking a detour from its comedic route, the <strong><em>LA Times</em> praised the episode, calling it television's "<em>best depiction of clinical depression ever</em>" among TV characters diagnosed with mental disorders. </strong> Aya Cash earned a Critics' Choice Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Gretchen Cutler in <em>You're the Worst</em>.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">You're the Worst</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><h2>            Edgar Quintero (You're The Worst)        </h2><h3>      Played By Desmin Borges  </h3><p>          Also in <em>You're The Worst</em> is Edgar, who is a combat veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Unlike Gretchen, whose mental illness is treated as a story reveal,<strong> Edgar's PTSD is a part of his character from the start of the show, woven into his storylines with sensitivity and a realism that isn't always present in comedies</strong>.   </p><p>          Edgar struggles with his medication, wanting to take it to attempt to have as much normalcy in his life as possible, but also giving it up completely in season 3. <strong>Viewers are able to see Edgar's story from his own point of view instead of the outside</strong> looking in as he struggles with sleep, paranoia, and treatment. <em>You're the Worst </em>season 3, episode 5, "Twenty-Two", puts the spotlight on Edgar and his condition, and is meant to raise awareness for the number of combat veterans who end their lives because of PTSD.   </p><h2>            Rebecca Bunch (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend)        </h2><h3>      Played By Rachel Bloom  </h3><p>          There's no denying that <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em> is an extremely fun (and rare) musical series. That comedy, however, manages to deal with a lot of incredibly serious topics in a way that doesn't alienate viewers or pass judgment on those who might be dealing with the same subjects as the characters, including a TV character with a mental disorder that is rarely highlighted in dramedies.   </p><p>          Initially, many fans thought Rebecca might have been depressed or afflicted with a more generalized anxiety disorder as the show demonstrated her mental health issues, but left many aspects of them ambiguous. That changed as <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em> built to <strong>Rebecca's diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and attempt to end her life.</strong> Fictional characters with BPD are also often vilified instead of presented as people learning to exist with their illness. Rebecca marks a change in that.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h2>            Carrie Mathison (Homeland)        </h2><h3>      Played By Claire Danes  </h3><p>          <strong>Carrie Mathison lives with bipolar disorder while being a top-notch agent for the CIA in <em>Homeland</em></strong>. Her portrayal definitely deals with the stigma attached to those living with mental illness as she hides her mental disorder from her employers in an effort to keep her job. There's a fear of judgment and repercussions if she can't "control" it.   </p><p>          The show allows the audience to see what it's like when Carrie feels supported and takes her medication regularly, and what happens when the opposite is true. <strong>Bipolar disorder doesn't dictate the narrative of the show, but it does inform a lot of Carrie's decisions. </strong>While some members of the audience might have found the depiction to use Carrie's diagnosis as nothing more than a plot point, <em>Psychology Today</em> found the way bipolar disorder was depicted to be incredibly accurate.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">Homeland</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h5 class="display-card-title ">Homeland: 10 Things You Forgot From The First Episode</h5><p class="display-card-excerpt not one">Homeland went through a lot of changes over its run. So much was different by the end, that fans probably forgot key things from the first episode.</p><h2>            Jackson Marchetti (Sex Education)        </h2><h3>      Played By Kedar Williams-Stirling  </h3><p>          <strong>Male characters dealing with mental illness are far less common than females in modern media</strong>, though this does not reflect reality. Jackson Marchetti is a great example of a male TV character breaking the stigma, with some help from his loved ones, and accepting his mental illness. Jackson is a prolific swimmer in his school, has always dated "popular" girls, and is elected Head Boy at school.   </p><p>          He seems to have everything going for him, yet <strong>he's one of the newer fictional characters who have to deal with debilitating anxiety, so much so that it leads him to self-harm.</strong> He goes through a journey in which he evaluates his relationship with swimming and his moms, eventually accepting help from his friends and allowing himself to open up to others. Seeing someone portrayed as a popular jock yet needing to accept help is a very positive example of representation in the TV show.   </p><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1lqab2_sex_education_tv_poster.jpg" alt="Sex Education TV Poster"><figcaption><em>Sex Education TV Poster.

She also develops an addiction to a tranquilizer pill in her childhood, something that impacts her greatly. <strong>Beth's mental illness isn't labeled explicitly in the series</strong>, but she has an unhealthy obsession with winning. She also does everything in her power to sabotage herself: she drinks, smokes, takes other substances, and drowns herself in sorrow.   </p><p>          She also isolates herself and often rejects the help of other people. A reporter even labels her a genius and implies that she is "mad." Care Clincs wrote, "<em>Throughout the mini-series, Beth was battling her own inner demons, including insecurity and self-loathing which led to self-destructive behaviors</em>." However, by the end of <em>The Queen's Gambit</em>, "<em>Beth’s journey was a tale of self-discovery.</em>"   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">The Queen's Gambit</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h2>            Beth Cassidy (Dare Me)        </h2><h3>      Played By Marlo Kelly  </h3><p>          <em>Dare Me</em>'s Beth Cassidy is a lesser-known character when it comes to television shows, but a powerful one nevertheless. She's used to having power, but when her best friend starts to spend more time with their new cheer coach, Beth feels their friendship — and her hold over the team — slipping away. Like other TV characters with mental disorders, though, <strong>Beth is depicted with symptoms of more than one, her mental illness isn't explicitly labeled.</strong>   </p><p>          She starts to spend time with people who are bad for her, even abusive. She withdraws into herself, ignoring texts and botching commitments. Nobody around Beth seems to notice or understand what's going on with her because she can't bring herself to be honest about her experiences. This is all too common when it comes to mental illness, as is Beth's isolation.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">Dare Me</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h2>            Hannah Horvath (Girls)        </h2><h3>      Played By Lena Dunham  </h3><p>          Lena Dunham plays the main character of HBO's <em>Girls. </em><strong>Hannah Horvath struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a well-known but not well-represented mental illness in media. </strong>Hannah also struggles to financially support herself. She mostly experiences the symptoms of OCD at particularly stressful times in her life, which viewers have praised as an accurate depiction of the condition. OCD is often made fun of or used as meme fodder, and Hannah's portrayal has helped to change that.   </p><p>          Dunham felt it was important to ensure that her character's symptoms and journey were as accurate as possible.  </p><p>          <em>Psychology Today</em> broke down Dunham's depiction of OCD in <em>Girls</em>. According to the site, while the show follows Dunham's personal journey, it also displays "<em>genuine symptoms"</em> of the illness. <strong>Dunham herself was diagnosed with OCD when she was nine</strong>, and she has often said she is "<em>afraid of everything</em>." As a result, Dunham felt it was important to ensure that her character's symptoms and journey were as accurate as possible.   </p><h2>            Sydney Novak (I Am Not Okay With This)        </h2><h3>      Played By Sophia Lillis  </h3><p>          In <em>I Am Not Okay withThis</em>, Sydney is an angsty teen trying to process her father's recent death by suicide, her romantic feelings toward her best friend, and her newfound supernatural abilities. In th end, it turns out that these abilities are metaphorical representations of her mental health. <strong>Sydney lives with anxiety and depression and seems to have inherited her powers from her father, who struggled with PTSD</strong>.   </p><p>          Her outbursts of telekinesis are physical manifestations of how she feels when she's anxious, angry, frustrated, embarrassed, or sad. They're also an accessible way for those in the audience who can't empathize with these feelings to understand how she feels. It might not be realistic when it comes to the supernatural situations, but by seeing them unfold based on her own mental illness, it makes it easier to comprehend.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">I Am Not Okay with This</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h5 class="display-card-title ">I Am Not Okay With This: 10 Questions We Still Have</h5><p class="display-card-excerpt not one">Netflix's I Am Not Okay With This will not be returning for a second season, but that doesn't mean we don't have a lot of questions left...</p><h2>            BoJack Horseman (BoJack Horseman)        </h2><h3>      Voiced By Will Arnett  </h3><p>          <strong><em>BoJack Horseman</em> explores the titular character's struggles with addiction, depression, and the aftereffects of childhood neglect</strong>. The Netflix show blends BoJack's hard-hitting and emotional story with surreal humor, producing some of the most insightful explorations of mental health in an animated show. The characters in the series have become some of the most recognizable TV characters with mental disorders in pop culture.   </p><p>          BoJack's character is not two-dimensional. His mental health issues and struggle with addiction are depicted in an honest and thought-provoking way. <em>BoJack</em> creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg told <em>Vice</em> that he wanted to portray BoJack's depression "truthfully" and explore "<em>l</em><em>ots of explanations for why BoJack is the way he is</em>." The one thing that this show does is attack these issues head-on. Nothing is easy, and nothing is handed to BoJack. He has to accept or deny any of the problems he faces and then deal with the repercussions of those decisions.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">BoJack Horseman</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><strong>Directors</strong><h2>            Alyssa (The End Of The F****ing World)        </h2><h3>      Played By Jessica Barden  </h3><p>          In season 2 of <em>The End of the F***ing World</em>, Alyssa copes with the aftermath of the first season. Her arc is an intense introspective into mental health as <strong>Alyssa deals with depression and recovering from trauma</strong>. Alyssa's arc in season 2 is handled honestly and respectfully and depicts the feeling of separation from reality. While the first season saw James self-diagnosis himself as a psychopath, the series never confirmed Alyssa's diagnosis or lack thereof in that season. Things change in the second season.   </p><p>          Actress Jessica Barden said in an interview with <em>Radio Times</em> that <strong>Alyssa is "<em>dealing with depression and doesn't understand it</em>."</strong> She went on to say, "<em>I've always related to Alyssa in her more brusk personality traits. And it was really interesting, and it was a great challenge to play somebody struggling with the things she's struggling with</em>."   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">The End of the F***ing World</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><h2>            Diane (BoJack Horseman)        </h2><h3>      Voiced By Alison Brie  </h3><p>          In <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, no two characters truly understand each other better than Diane and BoJack, and a large part of that can be attributed to their shared struggles with their mental health. <strong>Diane's depression is directly addressed in the first half of season 6, with her new boyfriend, Guy, urging her to take anti-depressants.</strong>   </p><p>          Diane's struggle is honest and raw. Her decision to take medication for her mental health mirrors BoJack's journey in rehab. During the closing scenes of the season, a rejuvenated Diane reunites with Guy at the airport conceding defeat about <em>Dawson's Creek. </em>It is interesting contrast to see BoJack, who seems to continue his downward spiral, which at one point metaphorically leads to the darkness of the abyss, and then <strong>see Diane, who seems to be on the road to self-help thanks to her finally accepting that she can't do it alone.</strong>   </p><h2>            Rae (My Mad Fat Diary)        </h2><h3>      Played By Sharon Rooney  </h3><p>          <em>My Mad Fat Diary</em> is a British comedy-drama that first aired in 2016 on E4 and <strong>focuses on teenager Rae's readjustment after leaving a psychiatric hospital</strong>. Rae is a lovable and heart-warming character and her struggles with self-esteem and mental health are handled in a sensitive but touching manner. Set in the mid-1990s, the show follows Rae as she reconnects with her best friends.   </p><p>          Critics praised <em>My Mad Fat Diary</em> for its portrayal of mental health and gentle humor, with Rae's voice-over giving a "<em>funny insight into her experience fighting her darker times</em>." (via <em>Vulture</em>) <strong>The show is about trying to adjust to the world after a person already feels broken in it</strong>. The best thing is that the series never uses Rae's mental illness as an excuse for what she does, but instead it is all about the motivation to be better as she improves herself.   </p><h2>            Jessica Jones (Jessica Jones)        </h2><h3>      Played By Krysten Ritter  </h3><p>          <strong><em>Jessica Jones</em> is an insightful exploration of post-traumatic stress disorder,</strong> and Jessica herself is a relatable heroine. Her season 1 arc in which she faces off against Kilgrave is a chilling analysis of abuse and trauma, but Jessica is as emotionally strong as she is physically, and her final confrontation with him is a satisfying end to a despicable villain.   </p><p>          <em>Jessica Jones</em> has been praised for putting "<em>women at the forefront</em>" (via <em>Independent</em>), and the third and final season features her inevitable confrontation with Trish, who descends into sympathetic villainy as she deals with her own addiction and feelings of inadequacy. <strong>Jessica struggles with her PTSD from childhood trauma</strong>, which is made worse thanks to Kilgrave, and possible, but undiagnosed, bipolar disorder. She works through these, finds help, and becomes a great hero without letting her condition wear her down.   </p><h5 class="display-card-title ">Marvel's Jessica Jones</h5><strong>Cast</strong><strong>Release Date</strong><strong>Seasons</strong><strong>Network</strong><strong>Directors</strong><p class="display-card-excerpt not one">Marvel and Disney have changed the title and logo of Jessica Jones' pilot episode on Disney+ - and the change may be an important one...</p></main>
