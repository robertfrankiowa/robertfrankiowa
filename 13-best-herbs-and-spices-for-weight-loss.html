    <main><h1>13 Best Herbs and Spices For Weight Loss</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Aviv Joshua, MS</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Aviv Joshua, MS</strong><p>Weight loss strategies can often focus on staying in a calorie deficit, but sustainable weight loss involves more than simply restricting your dietary intake. Successful weight management requires a holistic approach, which may include being intentional about adding certain nutrients that may help boost your weight loss efforts, including certain herbs and spices.</p><p>According to research, many herbs and spices can support weight loss by boosting metabolism and decreasing food cravings, among other benefits. While your spice rack can't replace routine medical advice, it may support your efforts to reach a body weight that optimizes your overall health.</p><p>Here are the best herbs and spices known to support weight management.</p><h2>1. Fenugreek</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1oSCRC_dried_fenugreek_leaves.jpg" alt="Dried fenugreek leaves"><figcaption><em>ajaykampani / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fenugreek is a common household spice derived from a legume plant scientifically known as <em>Trigonella foenum-graecum Linn</em>. It has proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, and current research indicates it may also support weight management efforts.</p><p>In a study, mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks and then given fenugreek. Results showed that fenugreek significantly suppressed body weight and fat accumulation while reducing fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Evidence indicates that fenugreek can activate the insulin receptor signaling pathway, which means that insulin increases the uptake of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and decrease inflammation in the body.</p><p>Those who are allergic to fenugreek may experience side effects, such as abdominal bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and low blood sugar. Discuss potential adverse effects and drug interactions with your doctor before incorporating fenugreek into your diet.</p><h2>2. Ginseng</h2><p>Ginseng offers many health-promoting properties, as evidenced by its role in various ancient herbal remedies. Modern science indicates that its bioactive compounds may play a role in weight management through multiple mechanisms. The ginsenosides found in ginseng can help fight inflammation caused by a high-fat diet and help regulate appetite.</p><p>Consuming ginseng can help prevent excessive food intake by regulating leptin, the appetite hormone, and decreasing glucose absorption. While there is no standardized dose of ginseng for weight loss, one small study involving 10 participants found that 8 grams (g) of ginseng extract per day helped facilitate weight loss when taken for eight weeks.</p><p>Ginseng isn't likely to interact with prescription medications, but it's important to discuss potential adverse effects with your healthcare provider before starting a ginseng supplement or adding the herb to your well-balanced diet.</p><h2>3. Cayenne Pepper</h2><p>Cayenne pepper, a type of chili pepper, may be influential in weight loss. It contains capsaicin, which gives cayenne pepper its spicy flavor and many other health benefits. According to research, capsaicin can boost metabolism, increasing the number of calories burned daily and supporting a calorie deficit for weight loss.</p><p>There currently is no standardized recommendation for cayenne pepper for weight loss. However, a recent study examined capsaicin's effects on weight when taken in doses of 2 or 4 milligrams (mg) daily. Participants in the study saw an average decrease of 257 calories per day secondary to capsaicin's role in appetite.</p><p>Those who like spicy food may enjoy incorporating cayenne pepper into their dishes. Sprinkle cayenne pepper over sauteed vegetables, eggs, and hummus for an added kick. Some people even enjoy it in their lemonade.</p><h2>4. Black Pepper</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1oSwC1_black_pepper.jpg" alt="Black pepper"><figcaption><em>Tim UR / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Black pepper, derived from the fruit of the <em>Piper nigrum</em> plant, is a staple spice in most households. It contains piperine, a potent compound responsible for its robust flavor and many purported health benefits, including weight loss. Piperine can boost metabolism during exercise by regulating carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Adding black pepper to your food may substantially increase calorie-burning and weight-management efforts.</p><p>There is currently no standardized dose of black pepper for weight loss. However, recent research found that oral piperine at a dose of 27 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight can lead to significant weight loss over time. A healthcare provider, such as a registered dietitian or nutritionist, can help you safely incorporate black pepper into your weight loss efforts.</p><h2>5. Turmeric</h2><p>Turmeric is a promising spice for weight loss support. Its main bioactive compound, curcumin, is responsible for its bright color, robust flavor, and various medicinal benefits. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties that help fight inflammation caused by oxidative stress and metabolic disorders.</p><p>Turmeric's bioactive compounds may also support weight loss by improving insulin sensitivity. Curcumin has been linked to improved blood sugar control and improved insulin resistance, which can help prevent fat accumulation.</p><p>There is no standardized dose of turmeric for weight loss. However, it's simple to incorporate into a well-balanced diet. Add it atop roasted vegetables or toss it into smoothies and teas.</p><h2>6. Cinnamon</h2><p>Cinnamon is well-known for its evidence-based impacts on weight loss. It can improve metabolism and enhance leptin levels, which are responsible for regulating appetite. Cinnamon may also support weight loss through its influence on insulin sensitivity. Research has found that cinnamon can improve insulin resistance, support appetite control, and reduce cravings for certain foods.</p><p>Additionally, cinnamon's anti-inflammatory properties can support overall health and weight loss. However, some research indicates that you need to consume a significant amount of cinnamon to see beneficial results. According to research, cinnamon can be a complementary weight-loss agent in doses of at least 3 g per day.</p><p>Cinnamon may also interfere with certain medications, including those that treat high blood pressure and diabetes, so it's important to discuss the herb with your healthcare provider before adding it to your diet.</p><h2>7. Cumin</h2><p>Cumin is made from the dried, ground seeds of the <em>Cuminum cyminum </em>plant. In addition to its delicious nutty flavor, cumin offers many potential health benefits, especially for those trying to lose weight.</p><p>A 2014 study found that adding 3 g of cumin twice daily to a serving of yogurt reduced the serum levels of fasting cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol. It also increased the participants' HDL cholesterol and significantly reduced their weight, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass. A 2015 study solidified these results with intriguing results of its own. Participants who took a cumin supplement three times daily lost 2.2 pounds (lbs) more than the control group.</p><p>You can add cumin to rice dishes, spice rubs, apple pie, roasted vegetables, yogurt sauces, and more.</p><h2>8. Oregano</h2><p>Oregano, a perennial herb known for its rich flavor, offers many medicinal properties that may support weight loss. It contains various active compounds, including carvacrol, which has been researched for its potential effects on metabolism and fat reduction. Carvacrol boasts antioxidant properties andÂ inhibits the expression of proteins associated with fat cell accumulation.</p><p>Still, research regarding oregano and its impact on weight is extremely limited. There is no standardized dose of oregano for weight loss, so it's best to discuss recommendations with your healthcare provider or registered dietitian before supplementing with oregano.</p><h2>9. Cardamom</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1oStRV_cardamom_seeds_on_a_wooden_bowl.jpg" alt="Cardamom seeds on a wooden bowl"><figcaption><em>Image Source / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cardamom, scientifically known as <em>Elettaria cardamomum</em>, is prized for its flavor and active compounds that offer various health benefits. It contains phytochemicals and volatile oils that may support weight loss through different mechanisms. For example, animal research has discovered that cardamom can increase energy expenditure or the number of calories burned daily.</p><p>The spice may also contribute to a lower body fat mass by regulating appetite. Unfortunately, there is no standardized dose of cardamom for weight loss. However, many studies have provided 3 g of cardamom daily to their experimental groups and have seen beneficial results.</p><p>While 3 g of cardamom is a lot to consume in one day, the spice is easy to incorporate into various recipes. Cardamom can add a depth of flavor to soups, curries, and baked goods.</p><h2>10. Caralluma Fimbriata</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1oSCRN_caralluma_fimbriata.jpg" alt="Caralluma Fimbriata"><figcaption><em>ePhotocorp / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Caralluma fimbriata</em>, an edible succulent commonly found in the dry regions of Asia, has been linked to weight loss due to its ability to suppress appetite. While more research is needed, multiple studies have found that 1 g of <em>Caralluma fimbriata</em> daily can support weight loss, especially in the abdominal region. Its influence on appetite can reduce feelings of hunger and support calorie restriction for those pursuing a calorie deficit.</p><p>Many weight loss supplements incorporate <em>Caralluma fimbriata </em>into the ingredients list. However, it can also be consumed whole. Despite its strong aroma, it can be eaten raw, boiled, or added to various sauces and condiments.</p><h2>11. Gymnema Sylvestre</h2><p><em>Gymnema sylvestre </em>is an herb commonly found in India and known for its effects on blood sugar. It contains gymnemic acid, which science says may help reduce the perceived sweetness of foods and reduce sugar cravings. The powerful herb can suppress glucose absorption and weight gain through its role in blood sugar control.</p><p>Research is limited regarding its ideal dosage for weight loss. However, <em>Gymnema sylvestre </em>can be enjoyed in a variety of ways, including in teas and smoothies. If you're taking diabetes medications, you should exercise caution when consuming <em>Gymnema sylvestre, </em>since it can affect your blood glucose levels.</p><h2>12. Green Coffee Bean Extract</h2><p>Green coffee bean extract has gained attention due to its antioxidant profile, which is reported to play a role in weight loss. It contains chlorogenic acids and other bioactive compounds that influence fat metabolism, appetite, and energy output. The chlorogenic acids in green coffee beans may also help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, which may contribute to fat burning.</p><p>Green coffee bean extract is often used alongside a healthy diet. However, while research has explored its benefits for several years, there isn't currently a standardized dose for weight loss. Individual results will vary, so it's best to discuss with your healthcare provider before adding the supplement to your routine.</p><h2>13. Ginger</h2><p>Ginger, a spice made from the flowering <em>Zingiber officinale</em> plant, is a staple in many kitchens. It has been used as a flavoring agent and in herbal medicine for years, and when included in a well-balanced diet, it may support your weight loss efforts.</p><p>A study found that participants who consumed 2 g of ginger powder daily experienced weight loss with a significant decrease in their BMI. Researchers continued to explore ginger's influence on body weight and found that it can support weight loss by increasing metabolism, inhibiting fat absorption, and controlling appetite.</p><p>There are several ways to enjoy ginger, including fresh, dried, and ground into a powder. It can be added to several culinary dishes, such as soups and lentils, but one of its most common uses is in ginger tea.</p><h2>Safety Tips For Taking Herbs For Weight Loss</h2><p>When taking herbs for weight loss, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider first to ensure safety and optimize their effectiveness. It's also crucial to source herbs from reputable brands and seek supplements that have been third-party tested for purity and safety.</p><p>Start conservatively and follow dosage instructions carefully unless directed otherwise by your healthcare provider. Monitor your response to the herbs or supplements and stop taking them if you experience adverse effects or negative reactions. Seek medical care immediately if you experience side effects or notice exacerbations of existing health conditions.</p><h2>When To See a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Sustainable weight management requires a holistic approach, and a qualified healthcare provider can be a valuable asset to your efforts. Weight loss may require changes to your dietary intake, sleep patterns, stress management, and physical activity. A healthcare provider can help you navigate the many factors affecting weight and safely implement any necessary changes.</p><p>It may be especially important to seek help from a healthcare provider if you've previously experienced weight loss challenges or have a chronic health condition. A registered dietitian or nutritionist can help you optimize your nutritional intake and safely implement herbs for weight loss.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Herbal remedies have been an influential aspect of wellness for many years. Herbs like ginger, green coffee bean extract, turmeric, and oregano have been linked to various weight loss effects. Some herbs help suppress appetite, while others increase metabolism and fat oxidation.</p><p>That said, more research is needed surrounding herbs and their optimal doses for weight loss, since not all herbs are appropriate for everyone. It's essential to consult your healthcare provider before incorporating new herbs into your regular diet.</p></main>
