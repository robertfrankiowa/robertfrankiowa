    <main><h1>5 Holistic Ways To Connect With Yourself Today</h1><p>There are many things we are expected to be taught at a young age, like how to communicate with each other, how to get from one room to another, and how to nourish our bodies. But when you think about it, were you ever taught about <em>self-connection?</em> We are often expected to develop individual personalities while rarely being taught how to connect with ourselves—the main ingredient in individualism. Seems like an oxymoron, doesn’t it?</p><p>Connecting to your inner being makes it easier for you to find the path in life that <em>just feels right</em>. It makes it easier for you to recognize what is actually harmful to you, even though you may think it feels good at the time. A personal example of this would be when I sleep past noon. </p><p>For decades, I enjoyed sleeping past noon because, why not? I am a night owl who doesn’t like breakfast food anyways. It wasn’t until recently, when I started beginning my days by at least 10am, that I realized I actually feel happier and more accomplished with myself when I get a somewhat early start. I only realized this after a long-time of trying to figure out what really makes me happy. </p><p>Self-connection is needed, but learning how to connect with yourself is easier said than done. There are many techniques that can be used to connect with the real ‘You.’ </p><p>Surprisingly, most aren’t modern. They are holistic. Holistic wellness sometimes gets a bad rep—often labeled “hippie medicine”—but in reality, most individuals equate a holistic approach with being all-natural or a way to enjoy life as safely as possible. </p><p>It often takes years of practicing some form of self-connection technique before they finally enter a state of feeling connected. Be patient and graceful with yourself because no life journey is easy. </p><p>Here are five holistic ways to connect with yourself and unlock happiness and uniqueness you never knew possible!</p><h2>What Are The Benefits Of Meditation?</h2><p>I am going to be honest with you, I used to hate meditation, or at least what I <em>thought</em> it was. <em>“Seriously, what’s the purpose of sitting in silence? Isn’t that friggin’ boring?”</em> I said often. During my self-connection journey, I realized that I was fearful of meditation because I was—and am—scared of complete silence. The idea of being alone with just my thoughts is scarier than Michael Myers could ever be.</p><p>Yet, there are so many evidence-based benefits to meditation: generating a positive mindset, increasing mindfulness and physical awareness, alleviating stress, and increasing calmness within yourself. Basically, meditation is proven to lead to a better life. It’s crazy to think how meditation yields so many benefits beyond just focusing on your own breathing and thought patterns. The results of this ancient practice are proof of the importance of self-connectedness.</p><p>Start Journaling</p><figure><img title="Provided by Swift Wellness" src="IMG/AA1gexe2_journal_prompts_when_youre_feeling_down.jpg" alt="Journal Prompts: When You're Feeling Down"><figcaption><em>Journal Prompts: When You're Feeling Down.

Guided meditations are easier for me to digest because I am not alone with my thoughts. There is a peaceful voice advising me on what to envision while I practice controlling my breath. This allows me to focus better than I would if I were left to meditate all on my own. </p><p>Following the few occasions I immersed myself in a guided meditation, I enjoyed the restful sleeps of my adult prone-to-insomnia life. I woke up, too, with a clearer mindset and more energy to enjoy the day. </p><p>All forms of meditation, from guided meditation to deep meditation, can be free with hundreds of videos available on YouTube.</p><h2>What Are The Benefits Of Yoga?</h2><p>Yoga is another ancient practice that focuses on connectedness. This thousands-year-old healing method is linked to many physical benefits, such as flexibility, increased strength, alleviating back pain, reduced inflammation, and improved heart health. However, it’s the other benefits that help make yoga a perfect tool for your journey of self-discovery. Yoga is known to improve brain functioning and mental health, promote sleep, reduce stress, and increase a positive vantage point of life. These are each key components of connecting with yourself. </p><p>Practicing yoga can sometimes be expensive, but it certainly doesn’t have to be. Many yoga instructors offer free full-length classes on platforms like YouTube and sequence ideas on TikTok. </p><h2>How Can Writing Be Healing?</h2><p>We love journaling here at Swift Wellness. Scratch that. We’re kind of <em>obsessed </em>with journaling. There are so many reasons for why we collectively feel everyone should prioritize journaling. One big reason is because journaling is therapeutic. By putting your words onto paper, you are literally clearing your mind. It is then easier for you to both think generally and understand your (and others’) complex emotions. This powerful tool isn’t limited to just journaling.</p><p>As a whole, writing can easily lead to <em>serious</em> self-realization. Creative prompts can be just as therapeutic as personal journaling or writing an autobiography. Getting your creative juices following is a key step in unlocking your unique imagination. Sometimes, within your fantasies, you’ll find a life you actually want to make a reality. You <em>deserve</em> that reality. You could even use writing to map out steps to make that reality happen. </p><p>Related Posts</p><figure><img title="Provided by Swift Wellness" src="IMG/AA1geFTB_20_best_guided_journals_to_become_your_best_self.jpg" alt="20 Best Guided Journals To Become Your Best Self"><figcaption><em>There are many things we are expected to be taught at a young age, like how to communicate with each other, how to get f.

All you will need is a pen or pencil and paper. If you are able, many people enjoy purchasing a dedicated journal or pad within their budget. </p><blockquote><em>“Sometimes, within your fantasies, you’ll find a life you actually want to make a reality.

Sound therapy is a medicinal practice that incorporates sounds such as chants, music, and instruments in a therapeutic manner intended to promote wellness. Some physical benefits linked to sound or music therapy include reducing stress, cholesterol, blood pressure, and the chance of heart and stroke. </p><p>Yet, sound therapy can also lead to feeling connected with yourself and others by way of reducing anxiety and depression while promoting intense self-reflection and a sense of calmness. This may be why so many of us view music itself as therapeutic and even euphoric.</p><blockquote><em>“Yet, sound therapy can also lead to feeling connected with yourself and others by way of reducing anxiety and depression while promoting intense self-reflection and a sense of calmness.

It is likely the earliest time that people recognized the benefits of enjoying nature. However, the term “forest bathing” is quite modern. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries coined the phrase “shinrin-yoku,” which in English means “absorbing the forest atmosphere” or “forest bathing” in 1982. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Swift Wellness" src="IMG/AA1geI3o_woman_walking_through_the_forest_bathing.jpg" alt="woman walking through the forest bathing"><figcaption><em>woman walking through the forest bathing. Provided by Swift Wellness</em></figcaption></figure><p>The benefits of forest bathing are extensive. This holistic healing practice is linked to reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and harmful stress hormones. This medicinal practice encourages extreme mindfulness where you become actively aware and engaged with each of your senses, all while in the naturally healing environment that is nature. As a result, forest bathing is believed to relieve anxiety, stress, and depression and promote mental clarity, calmness, and happiness.</p><p>No matter how busy life gets, it will always remain important to carve out some alone time as best as possible. This can be just five minutes of journaling in the morning or being alone together with a close friend in a quiet sound therapy session. These brief periods can make a world of difference for both your mental and even physical health. </p><p>Not just that, connecting with yourself often leads to a better ability to connect with your loved ones and strangers. Self-connection is the not-so-secret healing tool essential to happiness. </p></main>
