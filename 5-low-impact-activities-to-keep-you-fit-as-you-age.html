    <main><h1>5 low-impact activities to keep you fit as you age</h1><h2>Yoga</h2><p>Yoga originated as a spiritual practice based on stillness and breathing. In the United States, yoga typically includes other physical elements that require balance and strength. The slow movements and deep breathing in yoga can ease chronic pain and arthritis, benefit heart health, and improve energy and sleep. As part of a treatment plan, yoga can also help manage stress, anxiety, or depression, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine, among others.</p><p>Yoga positions and practices are also applied to specific illnesses and diseases and provide targeted relief for physical, emotional, or spiritual pain. Although the risk of injury in yoga is lower than in higher-impact activities, beginners should use caution to avoid strains and sprains.</p><figure><img title="Yoga" src="IMG/AA1eGvrT_yoga.jpg" alt="Yoga"><figcaption><em>Yoga. fizkes // Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Swimming</h2><p>Swimming is uniquely beneficial for protecting joints because it is zero-impact. The buoyancy provided by the water makes this an ideal exercise for people who experience pain during weight-bearing exercises. Swimming also helps with joint stiffness and pain by increasing circulation and maintaining muscular strength. Swimming also involves movement that directly counteracts the sedentary postures that aggravate lower back pain. Beginners can start by simply walking in the pool; this movement engages the muscles and increases mobility while providing support for joints.</p><figure><img title="Swimming" src="IMG/AA1eGsLN_swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming"><figcaption><em>Swimming.

Consistent walking can also lower one's risk of dementia, heart disease, and, according to the American Cancer Society, some cancers. Experts say in order to maximize these benefits, walkers should walk at least 30 minutes a day, keep a brisk pace, and aim for 10,000 steps a day. Walking is a flexible activity that can easily pair with unstructured activities such as gardening, housework, or running errands. Walking can also be a social activity and can play a significant role in reducing loneliness and social isolation. </p><figure><img title="Walking" src="IMG/AA1eGhHt_walking.jpg" alt="Walking"><figcaption><em>Walking.

There is also a wide range of bikes available to accommodate the different levels and environments that people choose to traverse. Biking outdoors combines the benefits of a full-body workout and the positive impact of fresh air, but stationary cycling still engages and strengthens muscles in a way that can reduce stress on the knees.</p><p>Experts say the continuous motion of cycling lubricates joints and increases mobility, no matter the speed or intensity of the cycling. Studies also found that people with knee osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis strengthened muscles and reduced the effects of the disease through indoor cycling.</p><figure><img title="Cycling" src="IMG/AA1eGrhw_cycling.jpg" alt="Cycling"><figcaption><em>Cycling.

The movements in Pilates require great control and core balance. Pilates offers a range of health benefits, including improved muscle strength, posture, mobility, and flexibility. The focus on core muscle strength can also reduce persistent back pain and increase the quality of life for people suffering from chronic pain in joints, bones, or muscles. One study found that people who practiced Pilates three times a week for eight weeks increased their mobility, stability, and balance—even more so than with yoga!</p><p><em>Story editing by Brian Budzynski.
