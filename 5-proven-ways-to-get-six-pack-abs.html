    <main><h1>5 Proven Ways to Get Six-Pack Abs</h1><p>Are you about to go on a diet? If the answer is yes, incorporating these five habits into your lifestyle will supercharge it and help you lose as much weight as possible the healthy way, according to certified fitness trainer Jason Kozma. Jason Kozma, aka Mr. America, is a champion bodybuilder who trains clients at Santa Monica-based High Performance Personal Training.</p><figure><img title="5 Proven Ways to Get Six-Pack Abs" src="IMG/BB1nsbG2_5_proven_ways_to_get_six_pack_abs.jpg" alt="5 Proven Ways to Get Six-Pack Abs"><figcaption><em>5 Proven Ways to Get Six-Pack Abs. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 Get Enough Sleep</h2><p>Abs start in the bedroom, according to Kozma. "Lack of sleep increases cortisol, a hormone that builds and maintains belly fat while wasting muscle," he says. "Most people require 8 hours for adequate restorative rest." The Sleep Foundation adds that enough z's is a mood booster, promotes heart health, regulates blood sugar, improves mental function, restores your immune system, helps relieve stress, and aids in weight loss.</p><figure><img title="1 Get Enough Sleep" src="IMG/BB1mj5Xe_1_get_enough_sleep.jpg" alt="1 Get Enough Sleep"><figcaption><em>1 Get Enough Sleep. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Hydrate</h2><p>Drinking enough water is also crucial. "The lowest recommended amount of water is eight 8-ounce servings of water per day," says Kozma. However, a better amount is 100 ounces. "Once you are actually thirsty, you are likely already dehydrated," he points out. "People often confuse thirst with hunger. Being hydrated optimizes metabolism." According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, men should drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day and women about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids.</p><figure><img title="2 Hydrate" src="IMG/BB1jSL21_2_hydrate.jpg" alt="2 Hydrate"><figcaption><em>2 Hydrate. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Avoid All Processed Foods</h2><p>Just say no to processed foods, says Kozma. "Processed foods are not recognized by your body and are more likely stored as fat," he explains. And, the more refined the food, the worse it is for you. "This means man-made foods like bread, cereal, frozen dinners, crackers, and chips are out," he adds. "Shop around the edge of the store, not within it. Cut all that out and you'll probably lose a ton of weight in a month."</p><h2>4 Create a Caloric Deficit</h2><p>Exercise is also an important component. "Losing weight entails creating a caloric deficit," explains Kozma. "Every pound of fat contains 3500 stored calories. If you want to lose one pound a week, you have to burn 500 more calories than you take in. That's hard to do and keep up with using only dietary intervention." Besides, "your body and mind require a certain number of calories to function, and going below that for an extended time (if you can keep it up) leads to damage to your metabolism. You can much less painfully create this caloric deficit by adding exercise."</p><h2>5 Exercise For 60 Minutes</h2><p>He suggests doing at least 60 minutes 6 days per week – 3 days of weight training and 3 days of cardio for beginners or intermediate level types.</p><figure><img title="5 Exercise For 60 Minutes" src="IMG/BB1mj5Xf_5_exercise_for_60_minutes.jpg" alt="5 Exercise For 60 Minutes"><figcaption><em>5 Exercise For 60 Minutes. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Amp Up Your Protein Intake</h2><p>Finally, eat more protein. "Your muscles are made of protein, not potato chips," Kozma says, who suggests that a good macro ratio for people who lift weights is 40/40/20. "That means 40% of daily calories from protein, 40% from carbohydrates, and 20% from fat. All these foods should be as whole and natural as possible; yes, oatmeal, no Fruit Loops."
