All it takes are a few days in a slightly off-kilter position, and boom: low-back pain for a week. Should you accidentally slip into the habit of slouching while you sit, the pain can last even longer. The frustrating part is that oftentimes, unhealthy sitting postures don't even feel bad (at least not at first). </p><p>"It's very common to slip into some of these positions because, at the time, they can feel super comfortable," says Supreet Shah, DC, MS, CCSP. But sitting with a slumped or slouched posture can eventually put strain on your muscles and make it more difficult to activate them when you get up and start moving again. This is typically when lower-back pain occurs. Lower-back pain can also happen from leaning too far forward. This can occur if you're not giving your lower back enough support, or even just placing your keyboard and mouse a little too far away. Again, it's not always easy to tell when you're slipping into one of these sitting positions that can cause lower-back pain, but knowing how to spot them is the first step. From there, it's just a matter of tweaking your habits or desk setup (or maybe both) to help you and your back find some relief. To help you figure out exactly why your back may be hurting while sitting, we spoke to an expert about potential causes, solutions, and exercises you can do to alleviate pain. Read on to find out how to help your hurt and sit more comfortably in the long run. </p><p>Supreet Shah, DC, MS, CCSP, is a chiropractor, as well as the owner and clinic director of TruSpine in San Francisco.</p><h2>What Causes Lower-Back Pain?</h2><p>According to Dr. Shah, there are two main types of slouching, and both can cause lower-back pain. The first is kyphosis, which occurs when you hunch your shoulders forward, causing your upper back to round. Lordosis is the opposite: an overarch in the spine, creating a large C shape in your lower back. "These two [positions] put extra pressure on the neck and the back," Dr. Shah tells PS. Added pressure can reduce blood supply to the muscles in your back, core, and abs, which can lead to "extra stiffness and weakness in certain parts of the body, like the lower back and the trunk," he says.</p><p>The problem is that it's not always easy to tell when you're starting to slouch. On an obvious level, stiffness and soreness in your lower back can indicate that you're slouching, or that your current sitting position isn't working for you. Sometimes though, seated positions can cause pain in other areas before triggering pain in your lower back. Here are some warning signs to look out for:</p><p><strong>Rounded Shoulders.</strong> If you often sit with your shoulders rolled forward, you may first feel pain at the base of your neck, across your shoulders, or between your shoulder blades, Dr. Shah says.</p><p><strong>Hiked-up Shoulders.</strong> It's common to let your shoulders drift up toward your ears, which can lead to tightness and stiffness in your upper back. You also might find that one shoulder is lifted slightly higher than the other due to unequal use. "Most activities that are performed are generally like one-sided," Dr. Shah explains, such as using a computer mouse or carrying a bag or backpack. "What you'll notice is there'll be a hiking of one of the shoulders . . . which can lead to pain at that part of the body."</p><p><strong>Head Dipping Forward.</strong> Also known as tech neck, a forward head carriage puts extra pressure on your neck, Dr. Shah says. Every inch that your head tilts forward "is about 10 extra pounds of weight for the neck," he adds. "That's a lot of work for the neck to do over the course of a day."</p><p><strong>Recurring Tension Headaches.</strong> Tension headaches are typically felt at the base of the skull or on one side of the head, Dr. Shah says. They can also feel like a tight band wrapping around your head. While tension headaches can be caused by a number of things - including stress, anxiety, eye strain, and sleep deprivation - poor posture can also act as a trigger.</p><p>These postures and signs of slouching might not cause lower-back pain immediately, but over longer periods of time, they can lead to muscle strain that puts extra pressure on your lower back.</p><h2>How to Reduce Lower-Back Pain</h2><p>When you're dealing with low-back pain, the fix isn't always as simple as just sitting up straighter. These are a few ways to quickly relieve a painful flare-up, but if the pain persists or continues to get worse, consider speaking with your healthcare provider for the best personalized medical advice. </p><p><strong>Ice the Area</strong>: Inflammation could be worsening your discomfort, so Dr. Shah recommends placing an ice pack on areas of pain in your lower back. Keep it there for 10 to 20 minutes, followed by a break of about the same length of time, and repeat as necessary.</p><p><strong>Try Cat-Cow Pose</strong>: This yoga posture puts your low back through its full range of motion, which can help to "decompress the low back," Dr. Shah says. Try a couple of rounds of cat-cow pose or incorporate it into a gentle yoga flow.</p><p><strong>Take a Standing Break</strong>: Stiffness can occur when less blood reaches the muscles in your back and core, which can cause them to "turn off" and result in pain. Standing up from your seat and walking around, even for a few minutes, tells your muscles to stay activated, Dr. Shah says.</p><p><strong>Assess Your Desk Setup</strong>: Make sure your screen is at eye level and that your keyboard and mouse are close to your body and not too high or too low - you shouldn't feel like you're reaching or straining at all when using them. "Seat height is important as well," Dr. Shah adds. Ensure the angle between your hips and torso is "a little bit more than 90 degrees," he says.</p><p><strong>Add Low-Back Support</strong>: Place a rolled-up towel or blanket behind your lower back to provide extra support, especially if you have a tendency to round your low back.</p><p><strong>Stretch the Area</strong>: In addition to yoga and stretches like Cat-Cow, Dr. Shah recommends trying a shoulder stretch if you find your upper back hunching forward. Bring your shoulders up toward your ears while keeping your arms by your sides, palms facing forward. Roll your shoulders back down your back to reset them and ease tension.</p><p><strong>Use a Foam Roller</strong>: Five to 10 minutes of foam rolling can serve as a nice self-massage for your back and the supporting muscles in your legs. Dr. Shah recommends placing the foam roller horizontally on the ground, lying on top of it, and running it along your upper back, glutes, and hamstrings. You can also turn the foam roller lengthwise and lie down on top of it, with the roller right along your spine. Stretch your arms out to the sides to open up your chest muscles, which have a tendency to cave in and contribute to slouching when you're working at a desk.</p><p><strong>Make an Appointment With Your Doctor</strong>: If your lower-back pain is intense or debilitating, make an appointment with a doctor or chiropractor. You should also see a doctor if back pain occurs after a fall or injury or if it's paired with bowel or bladder issues, leg weakness, or fever. These could be signs of serious health issues, such as sciatica or a kidney infection. Note that seeking professional help isn't only reserved for intense flare-ups. If your lower-back pain doesn't go away after a few weeks of trying these strategies, or if it gets worse, call a doctor or a chiropractor and make an appointment to receive individualized treatment.</p><p><em>- Additional reporting by Chandler Plante</em></p><em>Maggie Ryan was an assistant editor at PS.
