Eating hydrating foods can help you maintain your body's water balance, which is essential for good health. This article will take a look at how to increase your daily water intake with 15 choices of healthy and tasty foods.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pToD3_a_person_cutting_tomatoes_and_cucumbers_at_home.jpg" alt="A person cutting tomatoes and cucumbers at home"><figcaption><em>milan2099 / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Should You Get Water From Foods?</h2><p>Nutrition guidelines recommend a total water intake of 11.5 cups for women and 15.5 cups for men. However, this guideline assumes you get about 20% of this water amount from food, or about 18 ounces (2.25 cups) for women and 25 ounces (a little over 3 cups) for men. Food is a great way to increase your hydration levels.</p><p><h3>A Note on Gender and Sex Terminology</h3><p>Verywell Health acknowledges that sex and gender are related concepts, but they are not the same. To accurately reflect our sources, this article uses terms like “female,” “male,” “woman,” and “man” as the sources use them.</p><h2>Why Is Hydration Important?</h2><p>Staying hydrated is essential to health. Adequate hydration has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Regulates body temperature</li><li>Lubricates joints</li><li>Carries nutrients to the system</li><li>Maintains organ function</li><li>Can help with mood, cognitive function, and sleep</li></ul><h2>15 Hydrating Foods</h2><p>Enjoy these foods with high water content.</p><h3>Cucumber</h3><p>Cucumbers are 96% water, and pickled cucumbers are not far behind at 95%. They are not a great nutrient source, but the water in cucumbers contributes to your daily hydration needs.</p><p>Cucumbers are good for more than just chopping into salads as an afterthought, including:</p><ul><li>Make cucumbers the centerpiece of a salad by adding fresh dill and a creamy dressing (such as ranch).</li><li>Make an Asian-style salad with cucumbers and a dash of sesame oil, soy, and honey dressing, topped with sesame seeds.</li><li>Thinly slice cucumbers to add to a sandwich.</li><li>Add cucumber to bean salad or a Mexican corn salad with cotija cheese, lime, and cilantro.</li></ul><h3>Iceberg Lettuce</h3><p>It isn't called "iceberg" for nothing—this familiar form of salad green is 95.6% water. Though iceberg lettuce is not packed with nutrients. Two cups of chopped lettuce contain 16 calories and 20 milligrams (mg) of calcium, while the recommended daily calcium intake is 1,000 mg for adults before menopause.</p><p>For low-calorie, crunchy, fresh-tasting iceberg lettuce options, try:</p><ul><li>Wedge salads with cheese or a protein, iceberg lettuce, and cabbage slaw</li><li>Iceberg lettuce stir-fried with shallots or thin-sliced onions</li><li>In Asian-style wraps with satay chicken or beef, topped with a few chopped peanuts</li></ul><h3>Celery</h3><p>Celery is 95% water and full of fiber, which aids digestion.

It's a source of vitamins K and C, plus folate and fiber.</p><p>Explore ways to use romaine, such as:</p><ul><li>Romaine can take the heat from cooking better than iceberg can. Slice them lengthwise, baste them with a bit of olive oil, season, and grill them.</li><li>Romaine pairs well in a simple salad with lemon and grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.</li><li>Romaine is delicious sautéed with lemon and garlic.</li></ul><h3>Zucchini</h3><p>Zucchini, a form of summer squash, comes in at 94.8% water.

They are very low in fat and calories, with just 19 calories per cup raw and diced. Their nutrients include B vitamins, phosphorus, copper, and potassium. Mushrooms are the only plant food from which you can get vitamin D, but only when they are grown under ultraviolet light rather than in a darkened area.</p><p>Think of portobellos as a great meat alternative. Their umami flavor and dense texture are highly satisfying. Try these options:</p><ul><li>A grilled portobello mushroom on ciabatta, with some melted cheese and chopped lettuce, is filling and delicious.</li><li>You can stuff them with a mix of finely diced veggies and goat cheese, top with breadcrumbs, and bake them.</li><li>They hold up well when sliced and sautéed, making a delicious side dish.</li></ul><h3>Watermelon</h3><p>Watermelon is a delicious way to hydrate, containing 92% water.

Nonfat milk contains calcium just like full-fat milk, and 1 cup supplies 23% of the daily recommended amount. It also contains phosphorus. The vitamin D is added back during processing since it is lost when the fat is removed.</p><p>Ideas besides simply drinking nonfat milk include:</p><ul><li>You can make ice "cream" with nonfat milk, which has larger ice crystals and a less creamy texture, but plenty of taste.</li><li>Use nonfat milk to make smoothies for breakfast.</li></ul><p>Broccoli, which is 90% water, is also packed with nutrients. It supplies vitamins C and K, folate, iron, potassium, and fiber.

Sweating during exercise or on hot days depletes your body's water supply. Being sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea is also dehydrating.</p><p>Boost your intake of water and hydrating foods on those days. Watch for signs of dehydration, which include:</p><ul><li>Dark urine</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Dry mouth</li><li>Dry skin</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Less frequent urination</li><li>Less perspiration</li><li>Persistent thirst</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Staying hydrated is an important part of staying healthy, but you can get some of the water you need through food. Certain fruits and vegetables deliver substantial amounts of water and have the extra benefit of containing nutrients and making your meals delicious and hydrating.</p>
