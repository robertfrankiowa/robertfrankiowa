    <main><h1>I'm a Fitness Expert and 7 Simple Steps Keep Me in the Best Shape Ever</h1><p>Olivia Nevill is sharing a message of self-love with her followers. In a new social media post, the fitness guru known as Liv Livin Life issues a reminder that things aren't always as they seem online. What other advice does the fitness influencer and self-love advocate have for her followers? Body Network has the lowdown.</p><h2>1 Don't Believe Everything You See on Social Media</h2><p>"Reasons why you should NEVER believe what you see online," she writes in the post. "The workout claiming to 'snatch' your waist can be edited in seconds. The nutrition plan to get the 'body of your dreams' may be of a body that doesn't even EXIST. If something looks too good to be true, it probably is," she continues, calling photo editing apps "scary" and revealing that many influencers "you may be comparing yourself to can do this within a few clicks."</p><figure><img title="1 Don't Believe Everything You See on Social Media" src="IMG/BB1oJfEW_1_dont_believe_everything_you_see_on_social_media.jpg" alt="1 Don't Believe Everything You See on Social Media"><figcaption><em>1 Don't Believe Everything You See on Social Media.

"But it's so scary how easy it is. The app I/most influencers use for video editing has a body edit option where you can slim your waist, arms, and legs, change the size of your butt, lips, and eyes, add makeup, you name it. These used to be photos, but now videos, too. It's so hard to be able to tell what's actually real and what's not. So please remember, 'often the grass is greener because the grass is fake.' Not only does that mean just editing, but poses and angles are only showing a highlight reel here. This is why reminders like this are more important than ever. You are worthy just as you are !!"</p><h2>2 Do This "Leg Day" Workout</h2><p>Liv recently shared her "strong girl" leg day workout on Instagram. She started with RDLs, 4 sets of 10 reps. She moved onto dumbbell reverse lunges, 3 sets of 12 per leg, followed by glute-focused hyperextension, 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps, leg curls (4 sets of 10), and finally, a standing calf raise superset.</p><figure><img title="2 Do This " leg="" day"="" workout"="" src="IMG/BB1oJvw9_2_do_this_leg_day_workout.jpg" alt="2 Do This " leg="" day"="" workout"=""><figcaption><em>2 Do This "Leg Day" Workout.

"More people than you think struggle with their relationship with food & by doing this, it can almost glamourize disordered eating/cause relapse, which is something we should never be glamourizing or striving towards," she wrote in a post, reminding her followers that "skipping meals/forgetting to eat/avoiding certain foods, ISN'T SOMETHING TO BE PROUD ABOUT," she wrote. "This is the type of comment you really shouldn't say to someone struggling, or anyone for that matter, as it can really negatively impact them more than you think! Just be mindful of what you say."</p><figure><img title="3 No Skipping Meals" src="IMG/BB1oJrun_3_no_skipping_meals.jpg" alt="3 No Skipping Meals"><figcaption><em>3 No Skipping Meals.

Pumpkin Spice Lattes from Starbucks, which she encourages drinking. "Something that I know a lot of people will be scared to order us a pumpkin spice latte or other autumnal drink on a cafe menu, so this is your sign to get it!" she wrote in a post. "Missing out on moments like these makes me so sad â€“ these are the little things that romanticize life! Order it, go on a little autumn walk, go sit on a bench with a book whilst you drink it, and realise it's something that's meant to bring you JOY and not FEAR!!!"</p><h2>5 Change Up Your Meals</h2><p>Olivia says to "step away from your safe breakfast, go and buy yourself to chef up something different !!!" she wrote in a post. "It's so easy to get into the habit of having the same thing every day, but it can mean that anything else becomes a 'fear.' So step out of your comfort zone & try this challenge one morning. If there's one thing I learned in recovery and the journey to food freedom, it's that the change had to come from you. So many people can tell you all these things and try to help, but you have to make the change from within to fully commit to healing and starting your recovery journey."</p><figure><img title="5 Change Up Your Meals" src="IMG/BB1oJhWl_5_change_up_your_meals.jpg" alt="5 Change Up Your Meals"><figcaption><em>5 Change Up Your Meals.

"This smoothie is literally what I'm drinking every afternoon because it tastes so good & packs in the protein at 30g !" she wrote in a post, adding that it "contains 20 superfoods too ðŸ‘€ and has helped with my digestion MASSIVELY." Sometimes, she will add in oats and bananas to make it "more of a filling one."
