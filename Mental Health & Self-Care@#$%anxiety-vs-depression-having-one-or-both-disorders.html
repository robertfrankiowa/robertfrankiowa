    <main><h1>Anxiety vs. Depression: Having One or Both Disorders</h1><p><p>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are mental health conditions that can affect your emotions, state of mind, and behavior. Many people refer to these conditions as "anxiety" and "depression."</p><p>Depression can make you feel sad, empty, hopeless, and sluggish. Anxiety, on the other hand, can make you feel excessive worry, fear, and restlessness. It's possible to have both anxiety and depression; in fact, they frequently occur together.</p><p>In this article, learn more about the characteristics of anxiety and depression and how to cope with one or both conditions.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1mV5D6_upset_teenage_girl_looking_away_and_sitting_in_room_at_home.jpg" alt="Upset teenage girl looking away and sitting in room at home"><figcaption><em>Galina Zhigalova / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Anxiety Attacks vs. Depression Episodes </h2><p>Some anxiety and depression symptoms overlap, whereas others are different. Below is a comparison of the official symptoms of anxiety versus depression, according to the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition </em>(DSM-5), which is the handbook that providers in the United States use to diagnose mental health conditions.</p><h4>General Anxiety Disorder Symptoms</h4><ul>   <li><p>Excessive anxiety or worry</p></li>   <li><p>Being easily fatigued</p></li>   <li><p>Sleep disturbance</p></li>   <li><p>Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank</p></li>   <li><p>Restlessness or feeling on edge</p></li>   <li><p>Irritability</p></li>   <li><p>Muscle tension</p></li>   <li><p>Difficulty controlling worry</p></li>   <li><p>Problems in daily life stemming from anxiety</p></li>  </ul><h4>Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms</h4><ul>   <li><p>Depressed mood</p></li>   <li><p>Fatigue or low energy</p></li>   <li><p>Sleep disturbance</p></li>   <li><p>Difficulty concentrating or thinking</p></li>   <li><p>Decreased efficiency</p></li>   <li><p>Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities </p></li>   <li><p>Changes in appetite</p></li>   <li><p>Weight loss or gain</p></li>   <li><p>Psychomotor changes (slower- or faster-than-usual movement)</p></li>   <li><p>Feelings of worthlessness and guilt</p></li>   <li><p>Recurrent thoughts of dying</p></li>  </ul><h3>Similarities</h3><p>As noted above, some shared symptoms of anxiety and depression include:</p><ul><li>Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping too much or too little</li><li>Challenges with concentration and thinking. In anxiety, this may also manifest as your mind "going blank," and in depression, you may struggle with decision-making</li><li>Having low energy and being easily fatigued</li></ul><p>Both anxiety and depression can affect your moods, thoughts, how you see yourself, and how you interact with others and the world around you.</p><p>There are similar changes in the brain that lead to anxiety and depression. Research shows that among people with anxiety and depression, there are shared brain changes in the areas that manage cognitive control, executive functioning, and emotional regulation.</p><h3>Differences </h3><p>There are also differences between anxiety and depression. At its core, depression brings feelings of despair and sadness, whereas anxiety is associated with worry, fear, and dread that is disproportionate to the situation.</p><p>While both conditions affect you physically, they do so in different ways. People with anxiety are more likely to be restless, tense, sweaty, have heart palpitations, or fidget. Those with depression are more likely to have slowed-down movement and speech, appetite changes, and weight loss or gain.</p><h2>Why Anxiety and Depression Occur Together</h2><p>You can have anxiety and depression at the same time. Among people with depression, 45.7% also have an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. For people with anxiety disorders, between 20% and 70% will also have depression in their lifetime, with rates varying based on different types of anxiety disorder.</p><p>The reasons for this co-occurrence are complex, but there are multiple theories about shared causes and risk factors, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Chronic disease and pain</strong>: People with chronic illness or chronic pain are also more prone to both anxiety and depression due to the effects of these conditions on their quality of life.</li><li><strong>Genetics</strong>: There is a high level of shared genetic risk factors between anxiety and depression, but there is a lot that scientists have yet to understand about this connection. The ongoing Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) study is the most extensive genetic study on this subject, with over 40,000 participants.</li><li><strong>Nongenetic risk factors</strong>: There are other characteristics that anxiety and depression have in common, which could explain the overlap between the two conditions. These include childhood trauma or neglect, parenting style, and stressful events.</li><li><strong>Personality traits</strong>: Studies have identified the personality trait of neuroticism as linked to a higher risk of both anxiety and depression.</li></ul><h3>Can Anxiety Cause Depression?</h3><p>Older longitudinal research shows that having an anxiety disorder significantly increases your of developing secondary depression.</p><p>The symptoms of anxiety can be very limiting. You may constantly feel worried and afraid, leading you to avoid socializing or feeling restricted in where you can go and what you can do. Over time, this can lead to feelings of depression.</p><p>Anxiety affects the brain in ways that can contribute to depression. In people with anxiety disorders, the amygdala (the brain structure involved in the fight-or-flight response) processes become exaggerated, leading to a greater perception of danger and difficulty regulating other parts of the brain, like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.</p><p>These changes can lead to depression. Some studies have found an enlarged amygdala in people who have both anxiety and depression.</p><h2>Do You Need a Diagnosis Before Treatment?</h2><p>You don't need an official anxiety or depression diagnosis to make lifestyle changes to help you feel better. However, effective treatment for these conditions often includes medications and therapy, which are typically only accessible with a diagnosis.</p><p>That's why it's in your best interest to seek professional help for a proper diagnosis if your symptoms impact your daily life.</p><h3>For Anxiety</h3><p>There are several different anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety. Treatment can vary among conditions, which is one reason getting an official diagnosis is essential.</p><p>If symptoms like worry, fear, difficulty concentrating, feeling on edge, and more affect your daily life, then it's time to seek professional help.</p><h3>For Depression</h3><p>Similar to anxiety, there are different types of depressive disorder. These include major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), perinatal depression, and bipolar disorder.</p><p>Treatment is different for each condition. For example, someone with SAD would greatly benefit from a light box, whereas overexposure to this type of therapy may trigger someone with bipolar disorder. That is why a diagnosis is needed to get the most effective treatment.</p><h2>How to Cope Through Anxiety vs. Depression </h2><p>Whether you have anxiety, depression, or both, it can be challenging to cope in day-to-day life. You may feel that your symptoms are controlling you and making it difficult to do the things you need to do, such as going to work or school, socializing with friends, or even engaging in hobbies that you used to enjoy.</p><p>Healthcare providers often treat anxiety and depression with a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Because everyone is unique, treatment should reflect each individual's symptoms, values, and preferences.</p><p><p>If you have both anxiety and depression, your healthcare providers will create an integrated approach to treatment since many of the treatments for these two conditions overlap.</p><p>For example, antidepressant medication is also effective at treating anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective form of talk therapy shown to improve symptoms of both anxiety and depression. Various lifestyle changes benefit people with both depression and anxiety. Examples include exercise, mindfulness, sticking to a routine, and sleep hygiene.</p><h2>Reminders to Offset Anxiety vs. Depression </h2><p>Do not blame yourself if you have anxiety or depression. There are ways to help manage your mental health, particularly if you know that you are prone to anxiety or depression.</p><p>These strategies include:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet.</li><li>Get 2.5 to 5 hours of exercise per week or 30 minutes daily.</li><li>Keep up with regular healthcare appointments.</li><li>Learn your triggers.</li><li>Limit your intake of alcohol, caffeine, smoking, or drugs.</li><li>Practice mindfulness.</li><li>Practice sleep hygiene, including sticking to a sleep schedule.</li><li>Take any medication as prescribed.</li></ul><p>While these strategies won't completely cure or prevent anxiety and depression, they can help you limit symptoms, identify anxious or depressive episodes, and seek the care you need.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Anxiety and depression are two separate disorders that often occur together due to shared risk factors, heritability, and overlapping brain changes associated with each condition. In simple terms, people who are depressed experience sadness, hopelessness, and despair, whereas people who are anxious experience excessive worry and fear. Treatment is available for both conditions.</p>
