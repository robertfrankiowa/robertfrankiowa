    <main><h1>20 Ways to Boost Your Mental Health With Daily Habits</h1><p>The struggle with mental health issues may feel like fighting a losing battle. Sometimes you’re burned out, while other times, crippling anxiety looms over you. However, before losing hope, a change in lifestyle and incorporating simple daily habits that positively impact our minds and souls can help. A little goes a long way.</p><h2>1. Stay In Touch With Friends and Family</h2><p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 7% of adults in the United States have experienced a major depressive episode. To combat mental health issues head-on, staying in touch with the people you love is extremely important. They’re your first line of defense because you can share your sorrows and lighten the burden you’re feeling. Set up calls if you’re both busy so you can stay connected no matter what.</p><h2>2. Stay Active</h2><p>Experts at UCLA Health found the average person experiences at least 3.4 days of poor mental health in a month. However, when you exercise, that number drops by 40%. Staying active helps you release pent-up energy and pumps up endorphins that make you feel much better. If you start your day with happy neurotransmitters, you’re more likely to feel like you can conquer the day.</p><figure><img title="2. Stay Active" src="IMG/BB1ieeps_2_stay_active.jpg" alt="2. Stay Active"><figcaption><em>2. Stay Active. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3. Appeal to Your Senses</h2><p>We’re so engrossed in our lives that we forget to do basic things we enjoy. Do you like a serene walk in the park? Or does squeezing a stress ball make you feel better? Maybe some scented candles can help you relax after a long day. In any case, little sensory tweaks can enhance your mental well-being with minimal effort.</p><h2>4. Make Time for Relaxation</h2><p>Taking a break is crucial, especially when working a 9 to 5 in a corporate sector where you can’t breathe. Work and chores will always be waiting for you, but you’ll burn out if you don’t make time to help yourself relax. Set aside 30 minutes to release some of that tension you’ve stored.</p><h2>5. Eat a Good Diet</h2><p>According to Harvard Health, the more processed and refined foods you consume, the higher the risk of depression. It’s safe to say that we all know the benefits of a healthy diet, yet we continue to ignore it. To prevent this from happening, start small. Incorporate a fruit snack or make a delicious bowl of soup instead of resorting to processed foods to satiate those cravings.</p><h2>6. Take Time for Yourself</h2><p>Hobbies give you satisfaction like nothing else. Pursuing something you’re deeply passionate about helps lift your mood and boosts your mental health. No matter how busy you are, you should always take time to read your favorite book, watch a TV show, or enjoy a quick gaming session.</p><h2>7. Get a Good Night’s Sleep</h2><p>According to Columbia University, not getting proper sleep has been linked to adverse reactions to stressful situations and a lack of positive emotions. This is why resting and sleeping on time is vital to your well-being. It can be challenging to sleep when there’s so much work to be done, but sometimes, you have to push yourself to meet your needs.</p><figure><img title="7.

Find Your Purpose</h2><p>Knowing your goals and what you’re striving for in life is a tricky question, but once you find an answer, it helps you have control that improves your mental health. You can actively engage in activities that make you feel worthwhile, find ways to care for others, do one good deed every day, or do anything else that might make you feel whole.</p><h2>9. It’s Okay to Ask For Help</h2><p>If all else fails and you can’t find a solution that helps you, then reaching out to a professional is a good thing. Contacting your therapist and scheduling weekly sessions can help you get the help you deserve and need. With so much stigma around mental health, it’s essential to put yourself first.</p><figure><img title="9. It’s Okay to Ask For Help" src="IMG/BB1ibteK_9_its_okay_to_ask_for_help.jpg" alt="9. It’s Okay to Ask For Help"><figcaption><em>9. It’s Okay to Ask For Help. Provided by Kinda Frugal</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10. Cut back on Social Media</h2><p>According to Gitnux, 40% of girls who spend more than five hours a day on social media show symptoms of depression. Cutting back on social media is no longer optional because we see the negative implications it brings to our lives. You don’t have to go on a detox completely, but reducing screen time and replacing it with more fruitful activities will help you feel much more satisfied.</p><h2>11. Get Some Sunshine</h2><p>Experts at Healthline report that sunlight is thought to increase the release of serotonin, the happy chemical in your brain that directly impacts your mood. Instead of staying in your room all day, feeling miserable, get up and bask in warm sunlight to help improve your day. Enjoying your coffee in the sun can go a long way.</p><h2>12. Drink Plenty of Water</h2><p>Keeping those hydration levels up can uplift your mood immensely. According to CNET, proper water intake boosts serotonin production and helps you regulate your emotions much better. Instead of chugging down 50 cups of coffee in a day, opt for some plain water, and you’ll see a positive impact on your life.</p><h2>13. Positive Self-Talk</h2><p>You have to be there for yourself when the world is trying to pull you down. If you’re also talking about yourself poorly and being way too hard on yourself, no one is in your corner rooting for you. Practicing positive self-talk might seem useless, but in the long run, you eventually start believing what you tell yourself, making you more confident and improving your mental health.</p><h2>14. Find a Routine</h2><p>Routines help you feel in control, which helps ground you even with the most challenging schedules. Having a routine can reduce anxiety because it’s fixed and removes the fear of the unknown. You don’t need an elaborate routine to find semblance in your life; it can just be a walk and a hot shower.</p><h2>15. Journal Your Feelings</h2><p>Many people will tell you journaling helps, but you don’t understand how until you try it yourself. With all daily life stressors, penning down your thoughts is freeing because you can let all those feelings out in a word vomit. Journaling is one of those things that only helps if you do it every day.</p><figure><img title="15. Journal Your Feelings" src="IMG/BB1hGQOK_15_journal_your_feelings.jpg" alt="15. Journal Your Feelings"><figcaption><em>15. Journal Your Feelings. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>16. Make Yourself Laugh</h2><p>As absurd as it sounds, making yourself laugh is a great way to improve your mental health. When you’re crying, even cracking a simple smile, even when you don’t mean it, can help reduce some of those negative emotions. Watch a funny video, look at some memes, crack a dumb joke, or do anything that helps you laugh.</p><h2>17. Be Creative</h2><p>According to Forbes, creativity can have a positive impact on your mood. When you get into a flow, your anxiety is reduced, and your heart rate slows because you’re enjoying something and feeling fulfilled. Creativity can come in different forms, whether music, art, cooking, or something else; adding it to your day will help you feel better.</p><h2>18. Boost Motivation</h2><p>Lack of motivation is a common symptom of depression because nothing in life seems to be meaningful. To curb such feelings, pumping yourself help can improve your mental state. Reading a motivational book, watching an inspiring video, or even listening to a podcast that lifts you up are great ways to boost morale.</p><h2>19. Establish Healthy Boundaries</h2><p>Establishing healthy boundaries is crucial to achieving zen, whether it’s with friends, family, your partner, or coworkers. These boundaries help minimize arguments and fights that can impact your mood and allow you to have meaningful and respectful connections with the people around you.</p><p>Healthy boundaries should also be for yourself. When it’s time to work, you should focus on that, but when it’s time to rest, you have to turn off your work mode and let loose.</p><h2>20. Enjoy the Little Things</h2><p>Little things seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, though they aren’t. Living in the moment and enjoying little victories that come your way will help your overall happiness. If your coffee turned out better today, savor it; if your partner brought your flowers, take time to appreciate them because life is all about the little things we tend to ignore.</p><h2>18 Life Lessons Many Wish They’d Learned Earlier in Life</h2><p>As Gen X journey through the ever-changing landscapes of work, relationships, and personal growth, they’ve gained insights they wish to impart to their younger selves.
