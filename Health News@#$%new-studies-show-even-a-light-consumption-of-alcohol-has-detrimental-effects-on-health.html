    <main><h1>New Studies Show Even a Light Consumption of Alcohol Has Detrimental Effects on Health</h1><p>The study has found that consuming just one alcoholic beverage per day can drastically shorten your lifespan. Some researchers suggest that a pint of beer or a glass of wine can reduce your lifespan by two-and-a-half months.  </p><figure><img title="New Studies Show Even a Light Consumption of Alcohol Has Detrimental Effects on Health" src="IMG/BB1pCP2h_new_studies_show_even_a_light_consumption_of_alcohol_has_detrimental_effects_on_health.jpg" alt="New Studies Show Even a Light Consumption of Alcohol Has Detrimental Effects on Health"><figcaption><em>New Studies Show Even a Light Consumption of Alcohol Has Detrimental Effects on Health.

The information presents a rude awakening for those who like to relax at night with a glass of wine or a pint of their favorite beer.  </p><figure><img title="Significant Alcohol Intake Has Detrimental Effects" src="IMG/BB1pCRAf_significant_alcohol_intake_has_detrimental_effects.jpg" alt="Significant Alcohol Intake Has Detrimental Effects"><figcaption><em>Significant Alcohol Intake Has Detrimental Effects.

We use it for pleasure and relaxation, and the last thing we want to hear is that it causes any harm."    </p><p>However, researchers think that the outcomes are worth knowing about. Even though drinking has become proliferated in society, the negative ramifications are no less real.   </p><h2>No Amount of Alcohol Is Recommended by Doctors</h2><p>According to doctors and researchers, no amount of alcohol is safe for adults.  </p><p>Frequent or casual alcohol consumption can create a myriad of health conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, liver disease, and more.  </p><h2>High Amounts of Alcohol Related Deaths in the U.S.</h2><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 20,000 people die due to alcohol-related cancers in the United States.    </p><p>Most of these people self-identified as "moderate drinkers," which means one drink per day for women and two drinks for men.   </p><h2>Health Warnings Are Becoming More Popular</h2><p>Adding informational health warning labels on alcohol is becoming more commonplace to warn the public of the dangers of drinking.    </p><p>Ireland became the first country to pass a new bill requiring all alcohol bottles sold in the country to come with a specific health warning. Meanwhile, Canada has changed its health guidelines to recommend avoiding more than two drinks per week. </p><h2>The Case of Red Wine</h2><p>In the past, many people have considered a glass of red wine good for the body due to the high levels of antioxidants found in fermented grapes. </p><p>Many studies show a link between heart health and reduced inflammation to drinking red wine daily.     </p><h2>Studies Can Give False Results</h2><p>Unfortunately, the outcomes of studies can often be skewed due to uncounted variables.   </p><p>Often, with the case of finding health benefits of red wine, the studies often focus on individuals who live extremely healthy lives in other ways, such as exercising often and eating a nutritious diet. When a study confirms findings like these, it can often ignore the other variables in a persons life.  </p><figure><img title="Studies Can Give False Results" src="IMG/BB1pCTrb_studies_can_give_false_results.jpg" alt="Studies Can Give False Results"><figcaption><em>Studies Can Give False Results. Helena Lopes/Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Many Young People Choosing Sobriety</h2><p>Choosing sobriety and abstaining from drinking and smoking has become something of its own trend in recent years. Many people who avoid stimulants like alcohol and tobacco have no previous history of substance abuse.   </p><p>Instead, younger generations like Millenials and Gen Z have opted to take charge of their health and eliminate toxins and cancer-causing substances such as booze and tobacco.   </p><h2>Experts Warn To Always Avoid Alcohol on Planes</h2><p>Having a drink before a flight and following it up with another few to pass the time on a plane can be commonplace for many travelers. However, experts are recommending avoiding all alcohol on planes for a surprising health benefit.  </p><p>The combination of alcohol and the high altitude of flying can often be the reason why so many people experience anxiety, headaches, and even blood clots while on a flight.   </p><h2>Take Care When Drinking</h2><p>Stockwell's groundbreaking study has shown a clear link between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality.  </p><p>His findings might be a bit depressing for people who prefer to partake in libations as it contradicts the widely held belief that a little bit of booze can be beneficial for a long and healthy life. </p><figure><img title="Take Care When Drinking" src="IMG/BB1pCP2p_take_care_when_drinking.jpg" alt="Take Care When Drinking"><figcaption><em>Take Care When Drinking. Fred Moon/Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Make Choices Freely</h2><p>Although it has been scientifically proven that no amount of alcohol is good for you, it's still wise to make your own choices for your life. Anything can be safely added to your diet when consumed in moderation.    </p><p>Spreading information to society so that everyone knows the facts is the best thing to do for public health.  </p></main>
