    <main><h1>I Lost 60 Pounds by Walking and Following a Few Simple Food Rules</h1><p>Shawndra Sublett, Lead Teacher, YogaSix DTC, is a yoga instructor who personally lost a whopping 60 pounds by making a few impactful lifestyle changes, primarily in regard to her workout routine and diet. "My diet has evolved a lot in the last several years," she tells Body Network. What does she eat, and what are the rules she follows on a daily basis? Here is everything you need to know about her diet.</p><h2>1 Walking Is Critical for Her</h2><p>Shawndra gets her steps in. "It is a critical component for me to get outside and walk my dog a couple miles at lunch daily. This helps break the day, allows time for fresh air and sunshine, and is a mood boost mid-day," she says.</p><figure><img title="1 Walking Is Critical for Her" src="IMG/BB1psXfx_1_walking_is_critical_for_her.jpg" alt="1 Walking Is Critical for Her"><figcaption><em>1 Walking Is Critical for Her. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Small Portion Sizes</h2><p>Shawndra pays attention to portion size. "I only have a serving that can fit in my hand," she says.</p><h2>3 She Takes Time Before Allowing Herself Seconds</h2><p>Shawndra also allows herself time before going for seconds "because usually, we are full, but our desire for more of the good taste can trick us into thinking we are still hungry," she says.</p><figure><img title="3 She Takes Time Before Allowing Herself Seconds" src="IMG/BB1psUQH_3_she_takes_time_before_allowing_herself_seconds.jpg" alt="3 She Takes Time Before Allowing Herself Seconds"><figcaption><em>3 She Takes Time Before Allowing Herself Seconds. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 She Tries Not to Eat Alone</h2><p>Shawndra also tries to eat with company "as it helps you enjoy your meal more than eating alone, and if you live alone, eat at the table without television," she says.</p><h2>5 She Includes Whole Foods</h2><p>Shawndra tries to include whole foods that are detoxifying, "such as broccoli, beets, carrots, turmeric, lemon, avocados, and nuts," she says, "to help cleanse from environmental pollutants and help with digestion and inflammation."</p><h2>6 She Is an "Intuitive Eater"</h2><p>"I was a strict vegan for years, have tried Keto and other diet fads over the years, and now consider myself an 'intuitive eater,'" Shawndra explains. "Along with my fitness journey, I have found value in keeping my diet diverse and well-rounded."</p><h2>7 She Drinks Lots of Fluids</h2><p>"I like to begin my day with a saltwater/lemon cleanse, swish coconut oil, and drink mushroom tea," says Shawndra. She also drinks at least 36 ounces of juice throughout the day.</p><h2>8 She Doesn't Eat Until Afternoon</h2><p>"I usually eat my first meal in the early afternoon, which is usually very light, with some fish or chicken salad and a vegetable. I enjoy a full dinner of protein and plenty of vegetables, specifically a dark green leafy or broccoli," she says. "Depending on my emotional state (because my eating habits are directly linked to my emotional state), I'll have dessert, which can range from fruit and sorbet to a slice of cake."</p><h2>9 Here Is What She Doesn't Eat</h2><p>Shawndra avoids "processed foods of any kind & sugar," seed oils, and caffeine. "I tend to stay away from any meat that is not locally sourced if I can," she adds. "I have not completely eliminated any food, although I closely monitor my dairy intake. I work to eliminate processed sugar and sodium, so I try to prepare all of my meals or, when eating out, make selections from the salad menu."</p><h2>10 Her Number 1 Tip: Start a Journal</h2><p>Shawndra's number one tip? "Start a food journal of everything you eat and why," she says. "It will tell the complete story and help identify behaviors and patterns that can't be denied and should be eliminated, as well as any emotional ties that should be addressed."</p><h2>11 Keep Your Goals Small</h2><p>"For me, the hardest part of my fitness routine is keeping it a priority. It is easy to make excuses, to get too busy, or not to have the energy to keep up with it," she tells Body Network. One of her main tools? She keeps her goals "small and achievable" and doesn't beat herself up if she misses a workout.</p><figure><img title="11 Keep Your Goals Small" src="IMG/BB1oJhWc_11_keep_your_goals_small.jpg" alt="11 Keep Your Goals Small"><figcaption><em>11 Keep Your Goals Small. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>12 Get Out of Your Comfort Zone</h2><p>"Find a way to implement workouts with friends, try new activities that involve movement, get out of your comfort zone, and make it an activity that's enjoyable instead of something to check off your list," she says. Here are some of the workouts that helped her achieve her weight loss goals.</p><figure><img title="12 Get Out of Your Comfort Zone" src="IMG/BB1oJmvk_12_get_out_of_your_comfort_zone.jpg" alt="12 Get Out of Your Comfort Zone"><figcaption><em>12 Get Out of Your Comfort Zone. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>13 Shawndra Has a "Hybrid Workout Routine"</h2><p>Shawndra doesn't rely on a single workout to keep her mentally and physically fit. "I have come to love a hybrid exercise routine! I think that variety in your fitness is key to success," she tells us.</p><h2>14 She Does Strength and Weight Training Three Times a Week</h2><p>"Outside of my daily routine, I have found tremendous benefit from implementing a weight lifting routine three times a week," she says. "This helps keep up my overall strength and has supported my day-to-day functionality overall."</p><h2>15 Shawndra Starts with Shoulder Presses</h2><p>Her exercises included shoulder presses to "build overall shoulder size and development," side lateral raises to make her waistline smaller, body weight squats, and "effective" move that "can be done anywhere and work the entire body and so many variations," and planks, which also "can be done anywhere, target the entire body, strengthens the core" and can be done in "so many variations."</p><h2>16 She Also Does Yoga</h2><p>She also takes a hot or power yoga class "to jumpstart my day, regulate my mood, set my mind up, and increase my overall heart health," says Shawndra.</p><h2>17 She Never Forgets to Stretch</h2><p>Shawndra makes sure to stretch. "To counter the energy, I implement a deep stretch routine (oftentimes with red-light therapy) to slow down, recenter myself, and release any mental and physical stress I've accumulated throughout the day," she says.</p><h2>18 She "Loves" to Add New Ideas</h2><p>In addition to these exercises, Shawndra "loves" implementing a new fitness activity two to three per month, "hiking, paddle boarding, rock climbing, you name it, I'm there," she says. "As an adventure seeker myself, I find so much joy in learning new things and pushing my limits. Exercise is a gift! I've cultivated a life around fitness, mobility, and movement. Keep it fun!"
