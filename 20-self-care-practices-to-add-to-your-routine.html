    <main><h1>20 self-care practices to add to your routine</h1><p>Taking care of yourself is an essential part of being a grown-up, even if self-care hasn't always been a priority in our culture. Now, though, more and more of us are realizing that it's just as important to tend to our mental and emotional health as it is to look after our physical health.</p><p>Looking to work more self-care into your routine? Flip through the slideshow below for 20 easy, low-lift ideas for making your life a little more calm, cool, and collected. </p><h2>Try meditation</h2><p>Everybody recommends it, but meditation is one of the few self-care practices that's actually backed by science to improve your mental health. Consider downloading a meditation app, or simply spend a few minutes each day focusing on your breath and working to clear your mind. </p><h2>Go on daily walks</h2><p>Getting exercise can provide a mood boost, and there's nothing like a little bit of fresh air when you're feeling a little blah. It doesn't have to be a hike, either — even a 15-minute walk on your lunch break can serve as a mood boost. </p><h2>Work on your sleep hygiene</h2><p>Sleeping well is an essential part of good health, and many Americans just don't get enough sleep. Try to work on your sleep hygiene by setting a bedtime, or plan to put your phone away for a few hours before it's time to go to bed to ensure that you're getting optimal sleep. </p><h2>Set aside time for something you enjoy each day</h2><p>Even if it's just 10 minutes to work on a crossword puzzle, setting aside a little time each day to do something that you love can seriously boost your mood. Pencil your "me time" in on the calendar, and stick to it. </p><h2>Read more</h2><p>Most of us spend too much time idly browsing social media, and that can have an impact on mental health. Swap the screen for a good book for a less stressful way to pass the time. </p><h2>Minimize screen time</h2><p>Whether it's for work or pleasure, most of us are glued to a screen all day long. Making a conscious effort to step away from the computer (or phone) for a few hours each day can seriously boost your well-being. </p><h2>Take up a hobby</h2><p>After two years of being stuck indoors thanks to the pandemic, it's no wonder that plenty of folks are just plain bored. Use your free time to pursue an interest you've always wanted to try, like taking a ceramics class or learning a new sport and reap the mood-boosting benefits. </p><h2>Stretch in the mornings</h2><p>Tense muscles make it harder to relax in every sense of the word. When you wake up in the morning, spend 10 minutes after getting out of bed doing simple stretches that will get the blood flowing and help reduce stiffness. </p><h2>Take up journaling</h2><p>Journaling has a meditative quality for many folks, and spending a little time every day jotting down your thoughts can be of real benefit. It doesn't have to be anything fancy — any notebook and pen will do — and you don't have to stick with a theme or a prompt. Just open the book to a blank page and see where your mind takes you. </p><h2>Get outside in nature</h2><p>Getting outside for some sun, trees, and grass is an almost guaranteed boost for your mental health. Even if it's just sitting outside with your laptop while working, time spent in nature is a strong part of any self-care routine. </p><figure><img title="Get outside in nature" src="IMG/AA1kaVkA_get_outside_in_nature.jpg" alt="Get outside in nature"><figcaption><em>Get outside in nature.

Treat yourself to a deep-tissue massage every once in a while for a potent dose of tension relief. </p><figure><img title="Treat yourself to an occasional massage" src="IMG/AAU8vKS_treat_yourself_to_an_occasional_massage.jpg" alt="Treat yourself to an occasional massage"><figcaption><em>Treat yourself to an occasional massage.

As such, it's worth splurging on the perfect water bottle or cup that will make you actually want to drink water. Consider something large, like a HydroJug, or a cute insulated tumbler that can serve double duty as a coffee cup in the mornings. </p><h2>Fill your space with things that make you happy...</h2><p>If you're tired of looking at boring walls in your home or office, change them! Brighten your walls with cheery art prints, or consider textured pieces like macrame wall hangings and tapestries. </p><h2>...and get rid of stuff that doesn't</h2><p>Clutter can exacerbate stress and anxiety, especially when your space feels crowded and cramped. Take a weekend to purge your home of the stuff you no longer need and don't be surprised if you feel so much better once your old junk is out of the way. </p><h2>Consider therapy or counseling</h2><p>Even folks who aren't seriously struggling with mental health issues can benefit from therapy or counseling. Now, it's easier than ever to speak with a therapist thanks to apps like TalkSpace and BetterHelp. </p><h2>Treat yourself from time to time</h2><figure><img title="Treat yourself from time to time" src="IMG/AA1eEvEp_treat_yourself_from_time_to_time.jpg" alt="Treat yourself from time to time"><figcaption><em>Treat yourself from time to time.

Set a gentle alarm, think soothing music or vibration on your phone, and close your eyes for a little revitalizing sleep when you're struggling to power through the day. </p><h2>Try breathing exercises to reduce anxiety</h2><p>It seems silly, but taking deep breaths can actually reduce stress and make you feel calmer. Do some research on breathing exercises and find the ones that work best for your routine for a little dose of everyday zen. </p><figure><img title="Try breathing exercises to reduce anxiety" src="IMG/AA1kaQzc_try_breathing_exercises_to_reduce_anxiety.jpg" alt="Try breathing exercises to reduce anxiety"><figcaption><em>Try breathing exercises to reduce anxiety.

Adding a little calming music to the background, like light classical music or a stream of chill lo-fi beats on YouTube, can help calm your mind and make getting through the day easier. </p><h2>Take mental health days when you need them</h2><p>Taking care of your mental health is tough, but important to prioritize. When you need a mental break, treat it just like you would a sick day — take some time to yourself, spend the day in bed or doing something you enjoy, and start over the next day feeling refreshed and calm. </p></main>
