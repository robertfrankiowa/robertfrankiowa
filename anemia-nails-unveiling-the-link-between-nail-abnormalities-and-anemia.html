    <main><h1>Anemia Nails: Unveiling the Link Between Nail Abnormalities and Anemia</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by William Truswell, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by William Truswell, MD</strong><p>Anemia is a health condition in which the body does not produce or have enough healthy red blood cells. This can cause several changes in the body, including in the nails. Anemia nails often present as spoon-shaped with pale nail beds.</p><p>This article will discuss all the characteristics of anemia nails, diagnosis, and treatment options.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oSCRk_person_looking_at_nails.jpg" alt="person looking at nails"><figcaption><em>maruco / Getty Images.

People with anemia may experience nail changes like pale or whitened nail beds, spoon-shaped nails, and other nail changes that will be explained below.</p><h2>How Anemia Affects the Nails</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oSCRn_a_person_with_anemia_and_their_nails_have_koilonychia_or_spoon_nails.jpg" alt="A person with Anemia and their nails have Koilonychia or spoon nails"><figcaption><em>Reproduced with permission from Â© DermNet and Â© Raimo Suhonen dermnetnz.org 2023.. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Anemia is a health condition that can lead to changes in the nails. It can cause the nail bed to appear pale.</p><p>Spoon nails (koilonychia) is a nail abnormality caused by anemia that creates nails that change in shape and become both thin and brittle. This abnormality occurs in approximately 5.4% of people with anemia. The nails become concave in the middle and curve up around the edges, creating a spoon shape.</p><h2>Why Does Anemia Cause Nail Irregularities?</h2><p>Anemia is a health condition in which the body does not produce a normal amount of red blood cells. Without enough red blood cells, the body does not receive enough oxygen. This results in several changes throughout the body, including causing spoon nails.</p><p>Researchers do not have a clear understanding as to why spoon nails occur. One thought is that there is decreased iron in the epithelial cells (cells in tissue that line areas of the body such as the skin and nails), weakened skin around the nail, and decreased blood flow to the nail.</p><h2>What Causes Anemia?</h2><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 3 million people in the United States have anemia. Anemia occurs when the body does not make enough or loses too many red blood cells. Without enough red blood cells, the body cannot carry the proper amount of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. Many health conditions and other factors can cause anemia. They include:</p><ul><li>Autoimmune disease</li><li>Blood loss</li><li>Cancer</li><li>Chronic kidney disease</li><li>Consuming too much alcohol</li><li>Family history</li><li>Increased age</li><li>Inflammation from an infection</li><li>Nutrient deficiencies (B12, iron, and folic acid)</li></ul><h2>How Anemia Is Diagnosed</h2><p>Anemia is diagnosed by a healthcare provider who will perform a physical exam and look for signs of anemia. They may ask about a family health history for anemia or other blood conditions.</p><p>Blood tests also can detect anemia. A complete blood count (CBC) is the most common blood test, providing results on red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts.</p><p>If standard tests cannot explain the cause of anemia, a bone biopsy may be performed in which samples of bone are removed for analysis in a lab.</p><h2>Treatments for Anemia</h2><p>Treatment for anemia will vary and be based on the cause and severity of the condition. People with mild anemia may not need treatment. Below are treatment options that include dietary suggestions, medicine, and procedures.</p><h3>Dietary</h3><p>Iron supplements treat iron deficiency anemia, and B12 supplements or injections can treat B12 deficiency anemia.</p><p>Dietary changes can help increase iron intake. Lean meat and seafood, as well as nuts, beans, fortified grains, and vegetables, are rich in iron.</p><p>Medications to help your body make more red blood cells may be prescribed. Other options are medications to help manage the conditions causing the anemia.</p><p>Another option is a blood transfusion, which involves giving red blood cells through an intravenous (IV) line. This is typically reserved for people who are having serious complications related to their anemia and need fast resolution.</p><h2>How to Maintain Nails</h2><p>Nails need to be maintained to keep them healthy and clean. Here are tips on how to protect the nails and prevent issues:</p><ul><li>Keep your nails short.</li><li>Do not bite, pick, or tear nails.</li><li>Clip hangnails.</li><li>Use moisturizer after washing or showering.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet.</li></ul><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>A healthcare provider should be contacted when nails are not growing properly, are discolored, or have changes in shape. These changes can be the result of an underlying health condition.</p><p>Medical treatment is necessary for health conditions like anemia to prevent long-term complications like fatigue, headaches, heart problems, and restless legs syndrome.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Anemia is a serious health condition that can cause several symptoms and changes within the body. One of the changes is spoon-shaped nails.</p><p>A healthcare provider should be sought to manage the treatment of anemia and the resolution of any nail changes. Treatments that may be used include supplements or dietary changes.</p></main>
