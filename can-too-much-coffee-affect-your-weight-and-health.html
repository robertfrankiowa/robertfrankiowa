    <main><h1>Can Too Much Coffee Affect Your Weight and Health?</h1><p>When you’re trying to lose weight, it can feel like you have to give up — or at least cut way back on — all the vices you once enjoyed: refined carbohydrates, desserts, alcohol, sugary drinks. Surely, coffee is the one habit you can embrace with abandon, right?</p><p>Coffee actually has a lot going for it: On its own, it’s a zero-calorie beverage that delivers antioxidants and has been linked to lower risk of several chronic diseases. A lot depends on how you take it, however. Are you okay with decaf or do you crave caffeine? Do you brew your own coffee at home or prefer fancy drinks from a coffee shop? Are you one of the 18 percent of Americans who drink their coffee black, according to market research firm Drive Research, or do you add coffee creamer, and if so, what kind?</p><p>If these questions, like coffee itself, have been keeping you awake at night, you can relax. We asked Anna Smith, registered dietitian nutritionist for Lose It!, and Kaytee Hadley, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of Holistic Health and Wellness, how much coffee is too much, especially if you’re trying to lose weight. While you certainly don’t have to give up your daily cup, there are some ways to help ensure that coffee remains a habit that supports your overall health and weight goals, instead of one that detracts from them. </p><h2>Benefits of Coffee </h2><p>The majority of Americans are coffee drinkers: 73 percent drink it every single day, according to Drive Research. That’s generally a good thing. Research has shown that coffee, especially black coffee, is associated with many potential health benefits, including the following:</p><p><strong>It’s high in antioxidants. </strong>“Your cup of coffee delivers a boost of antioxidants to your morning, coming from flavonoids and phenolic acids,” says Smith. It’s phenomenally rich in these beneficial bioactive compounds, a study found. And antioxidants are chemicals that help protect cells against damage, per the Mayo Clinic. </p><p><strong>It helps with hydration. </strong>It’s a common misconception that coffee is dehydrating, likely because caffeine in large amounts is a diuretic, but past research found that consuming up to four cups of coffee a day provided hydrating qualities similar to water. And staying well-hydrated has been associated with weight loss, according to one systematic review. While water is hands down the best beverage when it comes to staying hydrated, Smith says coffee can be “a bonus to further boost your hydration status.” </p><p><strong>It’s associated with weight loss. </strong>You read that right. Although more than a quarter of those surveyed by Drive Research reported wanting to quit coffee to lose weight, drinking coffee is actually associated with weight loss — as long as you skip the sugar, according to a study. Adding even a teaspoon of sugar to coffee was associated with weight gain over time, the study found, and 44 percent of people prefer coffee with sweeteners, according to the Drive Research survey. </p><p><strong>It’s correlated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. </strong>Habitual coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, according to a 2022 research review, possibly because coffee helps the body use fat more efficiently as fuel, which can help maintain healthy blood sugar levels. </p><p><strong>It may help keep hunger in check. </strong>Caffeine is a well-established appetite suppressant, according to the Cleveland Clinic. For that reason, and because it’s so low in calories — just 3.6 calories per cup, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) — coffee is typically permitted on fasting diets, even when you are fasting before a blood test, according to the University of Mississippi Medical Center. </p><p><strong>It may boost your workout. </strong>A research review found that consuming 3 to 6 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per kilogram of body weight about an hour before working out can improve athletic performance by up to 8 percent. For a 150-pound person, that’s equivalent to about a 16-ounce cup of coffee. Why does this help? Caffeine acts on the central nervous system, making you more alert and quick to react, and it also makes the effort feel easier. “Coffee can be a great option if you want the caffeine boost without the added sugar or additives of energy drinks,” says Hadley.</p><p><strong>It could help you live longer.</strong> People who drink two to three cups of coffee a day had a longer lifespan and lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with non-coffee drinkers, according to one study.</p><h2>Risks of Coffee </h2><p>For all of its benefits, coffee is not without its risks. Here are some to be aware of:</p><p><strong>It can affect your sleep. </strong>If you’ve ever tossed and turned all night after a late-day espresso, you know caffeine interferes with sleep. How much caffeine is too much? Well, if you’re trying to lose or maintain a healthy weight, it’s smart to protect your shut-eye. “It’s worth considering how caffeine, such as coffee, is impacting you,” says Smith. “Sleep is one of those lifestyle pillars of weight loss.” There’s good evidence to suggest that obesity is associated with fatigue and sleep duration. One cross-sectional study found that those who slept less than seven hours a night had double the rate of overweight and obesity compared with people who slept from seven to nine hours nightly. </p><p><strong>It can up your intake of sugar and artificial sweeteners. </strong>Sugar is one of the major drivers of the rise in obesity, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Depending on how much sugar you add to your coffee, and how many cups of coffee you drink each day, that sugar can add up quickly without you noticing it. You might think an artificial sweetener is a better choice, especially if you’re watching calories or trying to lose weight — but it doesn’t help. A study found that consumption of artificial sweeteners is linked to increased body fat. Another study suggests that adding artificial sweeteners to your coffee could increase your risk of cancer. </p><p><strong>It can increase the calories and saturated fat in your diet. </strong>Most brands of coffee creamer have around 20 calories, 1 gram (g) of fat, and at least 1 g of sugar per serving, according to the USDA. “If you’re drinking one cup of coffee per day, the switch might be to begin measuring your cream or creamer. But if you’re drinking several cups of coffee, you likely need to make a bigger switch to eliminate those excess calories,” says Smith. </p><h2>How to Enjoy Coffee Without Sacrificing Your Health Goals </h2><p>While there are definitely some minefields to watch out for in the coffee landscape, it is possible for coffee to be part of your healthy lifestyle. Here’s what registered dietitians have to say about how much coffee a day is excessive, and how to enjoy it in moderation. </p><p><strong>Don’t drink it in the afternoon. </strong>Sip your coffee in the early hours to protect your sleep. “The half-life of caffeine is six hours, which means that if you have 100 mg of caffeine from a cup of coffee at 3 p.m., you’ll still have 50 mg in your system at bedtime,” says Hadley. </p><p><strong>Make your coffee at home. </strong>“I always tell my clients that coffee shops are catering to your taste buds. They aren’t prioritizing your health goals,” says Smith. These concoctions are notoriously high in sugar, fat, and calories. A medium French vanilla swirl frozen coffee from Dunkin’ clocks in at 680 calories, 9 g of fat, and 132 g of sugar — that’s the equivalent of about 32 teaspoons of sugar in one drink! What you put in your coffee really does matter to your health and weight goals. “Keep in mind that a lot of the studies done on the benefits of coffee are based on black coffee,” says Smith. </p><p><strong>Scale back on sugar. </strong>The USDA’s 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting added sugars to less than 10 percent of your total daily calories. If your daily calorie target is 1,800, that means no more than 180 calories or 11 teaspoons of sugar throughout your entire day. “Eliminating excess sugar from your diet is always helpful in long-term health and weight goals,” Smith says. If you make your own coffee, try to gradually cut back on the amount of sugar you add, or experiment with different roasts that may not taste as bitter. When ordering out, be specific with the barista about how many pumps of flavored syrup you want in your drink. “Typically, one pump contains 10 to 20 calories (all from sugar), and the average drink allows for four pumps,” says Smith. </p><p><strong>Pair coffee with protein. </strong>If you do use any sweetener in your coffee, it’s a good idea to have a snack alongside it that contains protein. “It helps balance blood sugar so that you have a more steady rise instead of a sudden spike followed by an energy crash,” says Hadley. “An example would be eating a handful of nuts.” </p><p><strong>Savor it. </strong>Smith says many of her clients really look forward to their daily cup of coffee. “Perhaps one of the biggest benefits of coffee is the joy it brings to your diet. And this joy is pretty important because a diet that includes things you genuinely enjoy is more likely to be a sustainable dietary pattern,” she says. </p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>A daily cup of coffee can be a good thing for your health, and regularly drinking coffee has even been linked to weight loss. The key is making sure you limit added sugars and saturated fat in your cup, and don’t let caffeine interfere with your sleep.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking </p></main>
