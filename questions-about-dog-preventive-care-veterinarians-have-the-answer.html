It is rich in essential nutrients, antibodies, and growth factors, providing vital support to newborn puppies. Colostrum plays a crucial role in the early development and immune system health of puppies. It provides passive immunity, transferring antibodies from the mother to the puppies, which helps protect them from various diseases and infections during their early weeks of life when their immune systems are still developing. </p><h5>Expert opinion from Dr. Jisha S<h5>Bachelor of Veterinary Science · 3 years of experience · India</h5></h5><p>Colostrum is the yellowish nutrient-rich, milk produced by the mammary glands of the mother dog in the first few days after giving birth. It is essential for new puppies as it contains important antibodies and nutrients they need to boost their immune systems and protect against infections in their vulnerable early stages of life. </p><h2>Why do dogs lick their paws?</h2><h5>Expert opinion from Dr. Deeksha Rao<h5>Bachelor of Veterinary Science · 2.6 years of experience · India</h5></h5><p>It can be a natural grooming instinct, similar to how cats clean themselves. However, excessive paw licking may indicate underlying issues such as allergies, skin irritation or pain. Dogs may also lick their paws when they're stressed, anxious, or bored, as a form of self-soothing. Monitoring the frequency and intensity of paw licking, along with other accompanying symptoms, can help determine the underlying cause and whether veterinary attention is needed. </p><h5>Expert opinion from Dr. Jisha S<h5>Bachelor of Veterinary Science · 3 years of experience · India</h5></h5><p>Dogs lick their paws for a variety of purposes, such as self-cleaning, pain relief, calming discomfort, and itching or an irritation. Always consult your veterinarian to identify the underlying problem, which may include allergies, wounds, or skin infections. </p><h2>What are some safe vegetables for dogs to eat?</h2><h5>Expert opinion from Dr. Jisha S<h5>Bachelor of Veterinary Science · 3 years of experience · India</h5></h5><p>Carrots, peas, green beans, and sweet potatoes are some examples of vegetables that are healthy for dogs and can be offered cooked or raw in moderation. These veggies are low in calories and can provide vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber to their diet. However, they should be prepared or given in a way that makes them simple for dogs to digest. </p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to Dog Preventive Care.</b></p><h5>Expert opinion from Dr. Deeksha Rao<h5>Bachelor of Veterinary Science · 2.6 years of experience · India</h5></h5><p>Many vegetables can be safe and even healthy for dogs to eat.
