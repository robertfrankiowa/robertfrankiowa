    <main><h1>Canada's Best Wellness Experiences For The Ultimate Detox</h1><h2>1. Enjoy a Chinese tea ceremony, Vancouver, British Columbia</h2><p>Set in an urban oasis in the city’s Chinatown, Dr Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden is as peaceful as it sounds. While a wander through the lush gardens is a must, people come here for the calming tea ceremonies that take place three times a day over the weekend.</p><p>Tea artist Veronique Vachon, who hosts the ceremonies, will talk you through a variety of tea tastings, including a red tea from Yunnan and a white tea that’s been aged for 15 years. You’ll learn how the water temperature is vital, how water quality affects the taste (soft water is better), and why specific teaware is important while relishing in the fact that your antioxidant levels will be through the roof afterward.</p><h2>2. Go forest bathing, Vancouver, British Columbia</h2><p>This concept, deep in the Capilano River Canyon, isn’t about hugging trees (but try that too): it’s about allowing nature to rebalance you. By walking in a coniferous forest – towering Douglas firs, hemlocks, and western red cedars are everywhere you turn – you'll feel your mood improve.</p><p>You’ll breathe in phytoncides (antibacterial derived from plants that kill virus-infected cells in our bodies) and within 15 minutes, your natural killer cells go up by 40%. “It’s like an injection,” says Alasdair Douglas from Rockwood Adventures, who runs the experience.</p><p>“Your serotonin and dopamine levels are boosted and adrenaline and cortisol decrease.” Finish off with a Douglas fir needle tea to boost your antioxidants – their needles contain eight times more vitamin C than an orange. </p><h2>3. Cross the Capilano Suspension Bridge, Vancouver, British Columbia</h2><p>Just a 15-minute drive away from the river canyon awaits an adventure not for the faint-hearted. The Capilano Suspension Bridge is a thrilling 450-foot-long crossing that dangles 230 feet in the air above the raging waters of its namesake river.</p><p>Sure, it’s wobbly, but your reward at the end is a rainforest canopy filled with yet more fun. Treetops Adventure takes you across seven mini-suspension bridges, while the newly opened Cliffwalk is yet another way to test your nerves.</p><p>The gravity-defying cantilevered walkway clings to a cliff high above the canyon. Finish off your adrenaline-pumped visit with a more sedate wander through Kia’palano, an area dedicated to the First Nations people which reveals the ties between their culture and the natural world. </p><h2>4. Eat at Mott 32 and The Acorn, Vancouver, British Columbia</h2><p>The food scene in Vancouver is special. Head to Mott 32 in the Coal Harbor district for high-end, innovative Chinese fare. The classy interiors, inspired by its Hong Kong flagship restaurant, are striking, while the food is to die for.</p><p>Go for the hot and sour Iberico pork Shanghainese soup dumplings, followed by truffle-topped mushroom lettuce cups. The star of the show is the crispy triple-cooked black Angus short rib.</p><p>Vegetarians or those cutting down their meat intake should visit The Acorn on Main Street, the city’s best fine dining veggie restaurant. They take vegetables seriously here, with creations that look like artwork. Don’t leave without trying the onion cake with carrot ice cream. </p><h2>5. Stroll through Cathedral Grove, Nanaimo, Vancouver Island</h2><p>Over on Vancouver Island, there’s nothing like a stroll in a breathtaking temperate forest of giant, 800-year-old Douglas fir trees to make you appreciate nature. This calming patch of green in MacMillan Park is an essential stop on a road trip between Nanaimo (the ferry departs from here to Vancouver Harbour and back) and Port Alberni.</p><p>There are two walking trails and plenty of vantage points to snap these beautiful, ancient, mossy wonders. A visit here is about much more than just a stretch of the legs. If you’re lucky enough to witness it when there’s a dusting of snow, it’s even more magical.</p><h2>6. Storm watching at The Wickaninnish Inn, Tofino, Vancouver Island</h2><p>The Wickaninnish, or The Wick as it’s affectionately known, has the tagline ‘rustic elegance on nature’s edge.’ But that doesn’t do its exquisite surroundings – or interiors – justice. The town of Tofino is famous for storm watching, thanks to its exposed coastline and the lack of landmass between here and Japan.</p><p>The wind, rain, and big surf provide all the entertainment you need for a strangely therapeutic activity, especially in winter. The Wick, perched on the rocky edge of Chesterman Beach, provides you with all the gear before inviting you inside, where comfort is key.</p><p>Built in 1996, all 75 rooms at this luxurious hotel have an ocean view and elements of the coast incorporated into the decor. The Pointe restaurant's smoked duck pastrami is unforgettable, as is the charcoal-grilled salmon served in a crab bisque with added caviar.</p><h2>7. Head out on a hot springs cove tour, Tofino, Vancouver Island</h2><p>Taking a dip in warm, healing mineral waters when you’re surrounded by the icy cold Pacific is beguiling to say the least. The hot springs, set on a rocky coastline through a hidden old-growth rainforest, have been used for centuries by the Ahousaht Nation, who call this land home and extol the water's medicinal and spiritual benefits.</p><p>Join Ahous Adventures for a guided cruise of the inlets, small bays, and islands of Clayoquot Sound, and keep your eyes peeled for humpback and grey whales, sea lions, sea otters, and golden eagles. You’ll also pass the Ahousaht First Nations community and learn all about the history and cultural significance of the springs, as well as the Ahousaht’s deep connection to this remarkable ecosystem.</p><figure><img title="7.

Head out on a hot springs cove tour, Tofino, Vancouver Island"><figcaption><em>7. Head out on a hot springs cove tour, Tofino, Vancouver Island. Danita Delimont/Alamy</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8. Spend time in Ucluelet, Vancouver Island</h2><p>Half an hour’s drive south of Tofino is Ucluelet, another jewel in the west coast’s crown. An area settled by fur sealers in 1870, it offers plenty of outdoor adventures, with surfing, fishing, and hiking particular favorites among locals and tourists.</p><p>Storm watching is also popular along this part of the Wild Pacific Trail, and (when you’re dressed appropriately!) there’s nothing more mind-clearing than watching giant white waves crash against the rocky coast. Look out for the stumpy Amphitrite Lighthouse, built in 1915 after the tragedy of the Pass of Melfort shipwreck in 1905.</p><p>For a tamer activity, a stroll along Long Beach, between Ucluelet and Tofino, is good for the soul, thanks to its picturesque setting. At 10 miles, it’s the largest and longest stretch of sand in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.</p><h2>9. Eat at Currents, Black Rock Resort, Ucluelet, Vancouver Island</h2><p>When food is served in such a spectacular setting it can sometimes divert attention away from the quality. Not so at Currents, part of Black Rock Resort. Each of its 90 seats has an ocean view so you can watch a stunning sunrise with your breakfast, sunset with your dinner, or the ferocious waves during lunch.</p><p>Top-notch breakfast choices include an array of ‘Bennys’ (eggs Benedict with ham, smoked salmon, crab, or avocado), with Poutine, steak and eggs, pus lighter options such as overnight oats, muffins, and smoothies also on the menu, all served with fruit salad for a refreshing hit.</p><p>Dinner is also sublime. Start with scallops, served alongside futsu squash puree, crispy pork and charred onion, and garlic sauce. For mains, the confit duck leg with beluga lentils and red cabbage is the one.</p><p><strong>Liking this?

Relax with a facial at Drift Spa, Black Rock Resort, Ucluelet, Vancouver Island</h2><p>Within the Black Rock Resort, the Drift Spa transports its guests into a realm of calm, with smart, tranquil therapy rooms where the subtle rhythm of the sea is the only soundtrack. A facial here is pure bliss, with attention paid to more than just your face.</p><p>Your feet, hands, arms, shoulders, and head are all massaged, while the relaxing facial includes a variety of cleansers, toners, and moisturizers gently painted onto your face before a seaweed wrap is left to work its magic. The result? Luminous, revitalized skin. You won’t want to leave.</p><figure><img title="10.

Take a helicopter from Vancouver Island to the mainland</h2><p>Why take the ferry both ways when you can reach the mainland in style? As a treat, take the Helijet from Nanaimo to the Port of Vancouver. A smooth, scenic, 30-minute flight over the Strait of Georgia is the ultimate way to travel.</p><p>Keep your eyes peeled for Stanley Park and the iconic Lions Gate Bridge, while the sprawling city of Vancouver comes into view as you’re about to descend. The helicopter seats 12, plus two pilots. Beforehand, you can fill up on free snacks and soft drinks at the terminal.</p><h2>12. Choose the perfect accommodation in Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>Arrive in the Yukon (a two-hour flight from Vancouver) in Canada’s northwest corner, up near the Arctic Circle, and you’re immediately met with wonder. There are no five-star hotels here – the luxury is your location.</p><p>For basic but cozy accommodation, check into Black Spruce Cabins, only seven minutes from downtown Whitehorse. The four boutique cabins are located in a dense forest dotted with fairy lights, with each cabin designed for two people and featuring all the mod cons for a comfortable stay. If you want more space, head to the Yukon Ski Lodge.</p><p>Also nestled in the boreal forest and close to ski trails, this stunning lodge features four guest rooms, each complete with a queen-size bed and en-suite, and a huge communal space centered around a log-burning stove (pictured). You can book out the space for workshops and yoga classes during your stay.</p><figure><img title="12.

Choose the perfect accommodation in Whitehorse, Yukon"><figcaption><em>12. Choose the perfect accommodation in Whitehorse, Yukon. Yukon Ski Lodge</em></figcaption></figure><h2>13. Grab breakfast at The Kind Cafe, Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>For breakfast on the go in Whitehorse, head to The Kind Cafe. Offering up whole foods with a health-positive perspective, the menu is plant-based and gluten free.</p><p>The smoothies are tasty and extra filling. Try the vanilla maca: banana, cauliflower, medjool dates, vanilla, hemp hearts, maca root powder, cashews, Himalayan salt, and coconut milk. Accompany that with banana nut toast: sourdough with banana, almond butter, toasted maple, cinnamon pecans, and sesame seeds – it’s more like a pudding than a breakfast, but it’s delicious (and healthy).</p><p>Wash it all down with your favorite coffee or try an anti-inflammatory turmeric latte or mushroom mocha.</p><h2>14. Experience the Eclipse Nordic Hot Springs, Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>Hair freezing aside, Eclipse, set in the untamed Yukon wilderness, takes you on a journey of health and wellness, with Nordic hot springs rituals combined with Japanese onsen healing practices. There are four different pools, each blending into the landscape, while inside, there are saunas and steam rooms, solarium, and a hibernation room.</p><p>Once you've topped up your zen, visit the Hot Rock Cafe for banh mi, salad rolls, and smoothies.</p><h2>15. Be wowed at Yukon Wildlife Preserve, Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>Just down the Takhini Hot Springs Road from Eclipse, prepare to be amazed as you see more than 12 iconic Yukon species in their natural habitat spread over a whopping 350 acres. Join a guided bus tour (with plenty of stop-offs for those all-important photos and up-close meets) to witness animals including Arctic foxes, elk, moose, bison, muskox, mountain goats, caribou, and Canada lynx.</p><p>Your tour guide will have stacks of knowledge about each species as well as the history of the preserve, which is home to the Yukon’s only wildlife rehabilitation facility. It is also a member of Canada’s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums.</p><figure><img title="15. Be wowed at Yukon Wildlife Preserve, Whitehorse, Yukon" src="IMG/BB1lto8W_15_be_wowed_at_yukon_wildlife_preserve_whitehorse_yukon.jpg" alt="15. Be wowed at Yukon Wildlife Preserve, Whitehorse, Yukon"><figcaption><em>15. Be wowed at Yukon Wildlife Preserve, Whitehorse, Yukon. Destination Canada</em></figcaption></figure><h2>16. Go glass blowing at Lumel Studios, Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>For a therapeutic, creative activity, try glass blowing at the Lumel Studios in downtown Whitehorse. A cool setting despite the hot temperatures – the furnace reaches a stifling 2,100°F – the studio has an array of workshops you can join.</p><p>Try the intro course, where you'll make either a small vase, paperweight, bowl, bird, or heart with one of Lumel’s patient and helpful resident experts. Afterwards, have a browse in the gift shop where there are exquisite pieces on sale.</p><p>You can collect your creation the next day. Finish off with tacos and beers at the onsite Mexican-inspired cafe and taphouse.</p><h2>17. See the Northern Lights, Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>You can’t come to the Yukon without searching for the Northern Lights. Join a private tour with Epic North to hunt for Mother Nature's greatest performance in the wilderness under clear skies, away from the light pollution of the city.</p><p>You’ll be driven to the Aurora Basecamp, a 25-minute drive from downtown Whitehorse. There’s a heated marquee and a campfire which you can sit around while toasting marshmallows, sipping hot chocolate, and sharing stories.</p><p>As soon as there’s any activity in the sky, your expert guide will tell you. You’re at basecamp from 10.30pm until 2am usually, so dress warmly and in layers (specialist clothing is available to rent). If the lights begin to dance, it'll be a night you'll remember forever. </p><h2>18. Visit Long Ago Peoples Place in Champagne/Aishihik First Nations Territory, Yukon</h2><p>A visit to any First Nations site is special, but as soon as you set foot inside the village at Long Ago Peoples Place in Champagne, an hour’s drive west of Whitehorse, you’ll immediately feel moved. Harold Johnson, a member of the Crow clan; and Meta Williams, part of the Wolf clan, are extremely welcoming.</p><p>On arrival, they get visitors to talk about their ancestors around a campfire, in what is a humbling experience. Harold opened the authentic village in 1995 and has continued to share his stories, passed down from elders, ever since.</p><p>If you go in winter, the village is thick with snow, making it even more magical. You can also attend Meta’s medicinal plant workshop, where she reveals the healing power of nature.</p><h2>19. Make felted soap, Yukon-wide</h2><p>She asked elders from the Northern Tutchone First Nations community and local children to gather wild botanicals in Mayo, central Yukon, in order to develop something beautiful. Creating her unique felted soap, which is wrapped in wool fibers, is restorative, while the spa-like fragrances they produce will immediately relax you.</p><p>Learning more about the history of the Northern Tutchone from Joella is an added bonus too.</p><h2>20. Take a cooking lesson, Yukon-wide</h2><p>This culinary workshop focuses on the real taste of the Yukon, using local ingredients and traditional flavors. Cooking is a therapeutic pastime, and chef Cat McInroy, owner of Well Bread cooking school and one of the most renowned female chefs in Canada with a Red Seal to her name, takes you back to basics while explaining techniques, tricks, and tips that will elevate your next dinner party.</p><p>Cat caters for chefs of all abilities and can teach you to make a choice of soups/stews, pasta, breads, sauces, appetizers, pastries, tarts, and desserts.</p><h2>21. Snowmobiling on Fish Lake, Yukon</h2><p>In winter, Fish Lake freezes over thick enough to land a Boeing 737 (30 inches), so snowmobiling (fine at eight inches) is safe enough and a fun, adrenaline-fuelled way to discover the stunning Yukon wilderness and the surroundings of the lake. The tour with Up North Adventures takes you up into the forest, where you’ll spot moose if you’re lucky, before ending with a well-earned hot chocolate and cookies, while staring out at the breathtaking panorama towards Mount Bonneville. Your camera roll will be full.</p><h2>22. Brunch at Belly of the Bison, Whitehorse, Yukon</h2><p>Sometimes wellness and self-care mean indulging in a little comfort food, and there’s no better place than Belly of the Bison on Main Street, Whitehorse, to fulfill that need. The cuisine here is refined yet comforting in an upscale setting (think smart, black leather seats with marble tables) and a visit here for brunch (weekend only, 10am-2pm) will hit the spot.</p><p>Go for the Belly Benny, with prosciutto, bacon, or a veggie option, served with hollandaise sauce, and hash browns. Fish fans will love the smoked salmon on toasted bagel accompanied by onion, capers, zucchini, and cream cheese.</p><p>Or for something sweet, try a croissant dipped in spiced egg wash served with whipped cream and maple syrup.</p><h2>Getting there</h2><p>Lynne Maxwell traveled as a guest of My Canada Trips, Destination Canada, Destination British Columbia, and Travel Yukon. My Canada Trips has launched a new Canadian Wellness Getaway itinerary, which includes all flights with Air Canada, hotel accommodation, car rental on Vancouver Island and in the Yukon, return ferries from Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay (Vancouver to Tofino), plus admission to the experiences mentioned in this feature.</p></main>
