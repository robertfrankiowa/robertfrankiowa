    <main><h1>Supplements for Breastfeeding: What Works and How to Choose</h1><p>     <strong>Medically reviewed by Melissa Nieves, LND</strong><p>Breastfeeding is a common source of nutrients for newborn infants. However, breastfeeding doesn't come easily to everyone.</p><p>When breastfeeding becomes a challenge, many people turn to supplements. Although various herbs and nutrients are thought to improve breast milk supply, scientific evidence supporting lactation supplements is mixed.</p><p>Regardless, supplements for breastfeeding continue to be a popular option for boosting milk supply.</p><p>This article will discuss lactation supplements and how they work. It will also cover the science behind commonly used supplements for breastfeeding, as well as safety, sources, and alternative options.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1kBok0_woman_holding_newborn_baby_while_sitting_on_bed_next_to_a_breastfeeding_pillow.jpg" alt="Woman holding newborn baby while sitting on bed next to a breastfeeding pillow"><figcaption><em>Getty Images / Belinda Howell. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How Do Lactation Supplements Work?</h2><p>Lactation supplements contain galactagogues, which are substances that are thought to increase breast milk production. Pharmacological galactagogues are available. However, foods, beverages, and herbal galactagogues are more commonly used.</p><p>Supplements for breastfeeding all have the same common goal of increasing lactation (the process of milk being created in the body). However, these supplements may work in different ways.</p><p>Lactation supplements may help by:</p><ul><li>Directly increasing breast milk production</li><li>Improving breast milk production by correcting hormone imbalances that may negatively affect lactation</li><li>Increasing the milk ejection reflex (a response from your body that increases milk flow) and improving breast milk removal</li></ul><p>In one study of breastfeeding people in the United States (U.S.), more than half reported using lactation supplements in one form or another. Despite this apparent popularity, however, researchers are uncertain if lactation supplements actually work.</p><p>According to a review of more than 3,000 nursing individuals, some lactation supplements may improve milk volume and infant weight. However, based on the quality of the available studies, the researchers felt very uncertain about the significance of any positive effects of lactation supplements or other galactagogues.</p><p>Still, numerous personal accounts by people who have tried supplements for lactation say they work.</p><p>If you're unsure if a supplement will be effective, it's best to look to the research and consult a lactation specialist before opting for supplementation.</p><p><h3>Common Causes of Breastfeeding Difficulties</h3><p>A breastfeeding person may try lactation supplements if they think their milk supply is low. However, poor milk supply is just one of many possibilities when it comes to breastfeeding difficulties.</p><p>There may be an underlying issue that cannot be fixed with lactation supplements. Other reasons for breastfeeding problems include:</p><ul><li>A poor latch</li><li>Tongue tie</li><li>Breast anatomy</li></ul><p>Consult a certified lactation specialist before trying any lactation supplements to make sure a low milk supply is indeed the cause.</p><h2>Supplements for Breastfeeding</h2><p>The use of galactagogues dates back centuries and can be found in both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, the ancient natural system of medicine of India. Today, galactagogues remain relevant and are used in Western and homeopathic medicines.</p><p>Commonly used herbal galactagogues include fenugreek, fennel, anise, milk thistle, blessed thistle, and goat's rue.</p><p>Research has been conducted on these and other herbs and nutrients often found in lactation supplements. For the most part, though, there isn't clear or concise evidence that supplements for breastfeeding are effective.</p><p>The research behind popular lactation supplements is outlined below.</p><h2>Fenugreek</h2><p>Fenugreek(<em>Trigonella foenum-graecum</em>) is commonly used alone or with other herbs or ingredients to increase lactation. Some experts believe, however, that the effects of fenugreek on lactation may be mostly psychological.</p><p>In animal studies, fenugreek has been shown to alter certain hormones, like insulin and oxytocin, that affect breast milk secretion.</p><p>However, in human studies, results regarding how well fenugreek works as a galactagogue have been mixed. While fenugreek has been found to have mild galactagogue effects in some, others have found no effects. A small percentage of users even reported a decrease in milk supply after using the herb.</p><h2>Moringa</h2><p>The leaves of the moringa tree (<em>Moringa oleifera</em>) are thought to be especially high in nutrition and bioactive compounds, some of which may increase lactation.</p><p>Some research shows that moringa may increase levels of prolactin (a hormone essential to breast milk production), especially in mothers of preterm infants. However, there isn't solid evidence that moringa benefits full-term infants or their nursing mothers.</p><p>More research is underway on moringa and its potential role in improving breastfeeding.</p><h2>Lecithin</h2><p>Lecithinis a mixture of lipids (or fats) and is an important piece of various bodily functions and processes. Lecithin is also found in human milk.</p><p>Typically, lecithin is used with the hope of relieving a clogged milk duct. Lecithin supplementation may also improve the quality of breast milk and the infant's nutrition and weight.</p><p>While lecithin may improve breast milk quality, there isn't evidence that it increases breast milk volume.</p><h2>Milk Thistle</h2><p>Milk thistle (<em>Silybum marianum</em>) contains an active ingredient called silymarinthat may improve lactation.</p><p>While galactagogue effects haven't been proven for milk thistle, some research points to silymarin as a natural galactagogue. However, most of the evidence supporting silymarin comes from nonhuman studies.</p><p>In lab and animal research, silymarin has been found to increase prolactin levels, which may improve lactation. A small human trial even found there to be beneficial effects of silymarin when given to nursing people.</p><p>However, in other studies, silymarin hasn't portrayed any galactagogue effects at all. More research is needed.</p><h2>Alfalfa</h2><p>Anecdotal evidence supports the use of alfalfa (<em>Medicago sativa</em>) for lactation, but scientific evidence is weak.</p><p>Alfalfa is found in many breastfeeding supplements due to its perceived benefits. It is believed that phytoestrogens in alfalfa may increase prolactin levels. Alfalfa may also provide important nutrients needed for breast milk production.</p><p>However, there are currently no clinical trials that support the use of alfalfa for lactation, as its effects have not been proven.</p><h2>Fennel</h2><p>The fennel plant (<em>Foeniculum vulgare</em>) has been used for culinary and medicinal purposes for centuries. Fennel is rich in volatile oils, phytoestrogens, and other substances that may promote breast milk production.</p><p>Although human research on fennel is limited, some studies have found a link between the herb and lactation. In small studies, fennel supplementation reportedly increased breast milk volume, fat content, and even infant weight gain.</p><p>It's important that larger studies be performed on fennel to further prove its effects on lactation.</p><h2>Shatavari</h2><p>A popular medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine, shatavari(<em>Asparagus racemosus</em>) may increase breast milk volume.</p><p>In one study, postpartum participants were randomized to receive either a shatavari bar or a placeboÂ (an inactive substance given to people in a control group). The bars were given for five days starting the day after delivery. Compared to the placebo, those who consumed the shatavari bars experienced significant increases in the total volume of breast milk as well as shorter times to breast fullness.</p><h2>Anise</h2><p>Anise (<em>Pimpinella anisum</em>) is a source of phytoestrogens and other bioactive compounds that may influence breastmilk supply.</p><p>Anise has been found to increase lactation and infant weight in various animal studies. These effects are mostly thought to be due to a compound called anetholethat is thought to increase prolactin levels.</p><p>In one human study, nursing people of preterm infants were given either anise tea or a placebo tea (black tea) three times a day for one week. Compared to the placebo group, participants who consumed anise tea significantly increased their breast milk volume on six out of the seven days of the study. However, no significant differences were seen in the weights of the newborns between the two groups.</p><h2>Safety Precautions</h2><p>It's important to take safety into consideration when thinking of starting a new supplement. This is especially true if you're breastfeeding.</p><p>Overall, research on herbs and supplements for breastfeeding is limited. There isn't much information regarding the safety of lactation supplements either.</p><p>Some supplements require very large doses to be effective for lactation, which may increase the risk of side effects or toxicity.</p><p>Side effects associated with lactation supplements are poorly reported but may sometimes occur. For example, fenugreek may cause mild side effects like nausea, vomiting, and low blood sugar in mothers and diarrhea in breastfed babies. Milk thistle supplementation may lead to diarrhea, headache, skin reaction, dry mouth, and nausea.</p><p>To prevent potential adverse events, only use breastfeeding supplements as directed. This means taking recommended doses and avoiding products you may be allergic to.</p><p>Always talk with a healthcare provider before starting a new supplement. Disclose all medications and health conditions to make sure the supplement is safe for you.</p><h2>Sources & What to Look For</h2><p>Lactation supplements come in many forms. These include teas, capsules, powders, and gummies. There are also bars, cookies, and other food products on the market that contain herbal galactagogues.</p><p>It's easy to find supplements for breastfeeding for sale in places like nutrition stores, certain grocery stores, and online. In stores, lactation supplements and foods are often sold with baby products or other supplements.</p><p>When choosing the right lactation supplement for you, it's important to do a little research.</p><p>Dietary supplements are not regulated like prescription medications in the United States. Therefore, some may be safer than others. When choosing a supplement, consider factors such as third-party testing, potential drug interactions, and other safety concerns. Talk to a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) about supplement quality and safety.</p><h2>Alternatives to Supplements for Breastfeeding</h2><p>There are alternatives to supplements when it comes to increasing your breast milk supply.</p><p>No matter what method you choose, the first step should always be a meeting with a lactation specialist.</p><p>A lactation specialist can help you determine the cause of your lactation issues and find the best steps to improve your breastfeeding experience.</p><p>It's recommended that you try other methods to improve lactation before resorting to supplements. To produce more breast milk, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) recommends that you:</p><ul><li>Breastfeed frequently, every time your baby is hungry.</li><li>Ensure your baby has a proper latch.</li><li>Offer both breasts at every feeding.</li><li>Empty your breasts at every feeding (if necessary, you can hand express or pump once your baby is done).</li><li>Avoid bottles and supplemental feedings in the early weeks.</li><li>Massage your breasts before feeding to stimulate milk.</li><li>Get plenty of sleep.</li><li>Follow a well-balanced diet.</li><li>Hydrate properly.</li></ul><p>Remember, you don't have to go through breastfeeding struggles alone. A lactation specialist or healthcare provider is there to help you.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Supplements for breastfeeding contain galactagogues that are thought to increase breast milk production and improve lactation.</p><p>Herbal lactation supplements are a popular option among breastfeeding people, yet scientific evidence supporting their use is weak overall. Additionally, safety information regarding lactation supplements is limited.</p><p>Although anecdotal evidence is in favor of various supplements for breastfeeding, it's recommended that you talk with a lactation specialist or other qualified healthcare provider before trying any for yourself.</p><p>    <strong>Can I take lactation supplements while pregnant?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Typically, it's recommended that lactation supplements only be used while breastfeeding. Some lactation supplements may not be safe to use while pregnant.</p><p>Breast milk production doesn't begin until after a baby is born. Therefore, there's usually no reason to use lactation supplements while pregnant.</p><p>    <strong>When should you start taking lactation supplements?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>There isn't strong research evidence on the optimal time to start taking lactation supplements. However, it's generally recommended that lactation supplements only be used after breastfeeding has begun and regular breast milk (not colostrum) is being produced.</p><p>Before starting lactation supplements, though, meet with a lactation specialist to ensure there isn't another issue. Lactation supplements are not necessary for everyone.</p><p>    <strong>What should I do if lactation supplements do not work?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>If you notice that lactation supplements are not working for you, meet with a lactation specialist to discuss other options.</p><p>There are other ways to improve your breast milk supply. Some examples include breastfeeding more frequently, emptying your breasts at every feeding, making sure your baby has a proper latch, and practicing self-care.</p><p>    <strong>Are lactation supplements safe for babies?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>When used properly, lactation supplements are generally thought to be safe for both the person breastfeeding and their baby.</p><p>However, keep in mind that there is very little safety information available for lactation supplements.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare provider before using any supplement while breastfeeding. Some products and ingredients may not be safe for babies.</p>
