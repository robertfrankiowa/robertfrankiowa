    <main><h1>Inside Shannen Doherty's Cancer Journey</h1><h2>Hair Loss</h2><p>The <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em> alum started experiencing hair loss amid her treatments, leading her to shave her head.</p><p>"After my second treatment, my hair was really matted," she told <em>Entertainment Tonight</em> in July 2016. "And I went to try and brush it out, and it just fell out."</p><p>It was then Shannen decided to cut her hair, with her mom helping her style it into a "cute little bob."</p><p>"But it wasn't enough," she noted, explaining that her hair kept falling out. "I don't know if I'll ever look like me again."</p><h2>Reconstructive Surgery</h2><p>In between rounds of radiation therapy, Shannen underwent reconstructive surgery as a follow-up to her mastectomy  in early 2017. </p><h2>In Remission</h2><p>In April 2017, the <em>Charmed</em> star announced she was in remission.</p><p>"Good news? YES," she wrote on Instagram. "Overwhelming. YES. Now more waiting."</p><p>At the time, Shannen noted that "the next five years is crucial" because reoccurrences "happen all the time."</p><figure><img title="In Remission" src="IMG/BB1pszU7_in_remission.jpg" alt="In Remission"><figcaption><em>In Remission.

"I definitely have days where I say, ‘Why me?' And then I go, ‘Well why not me? Who else? Who else beside me deserves this?' None of us do."</p><figure><img title="Second Cancer Diagnosis" src="IMG/BB1psCio_second_cancer_diagnosis.jpg" alt="Second Cancer Diagnosis"><figcaption><em>Second Cancer Diagnosis. Provided by E!

"I'm not ready for pasture. I've got a lot of life in me."</p><figure><img title="Forging On" src="IMG/BB1psxmB_forging_on.jpg" alt="Forging On"><figcaption><em>Forging On. Provided by E! News</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Cancer Spreads</h2><p>By 2023, the cancer had metastasized to Shannen's brain and spread to her bones.</p><p>"I don't want to die," she told<em> People</em>. "I'm not done with living. I'm not done with loving. I'm not done with creating. I'm not done with hopefully changing things for the better. I'm just not—I'm not done."</p><h2>Brain Surgery</h2><p>Shannen underwent surgery to have a tumor removed from her brain in January 2023.</p><p>“We got almost all," Shannen shared on her <em>Let's Be Clear</em> podcast, "and the rest we handled with brain radiation.”</p><p>However, she also experienced major setbacks in her road to recovery, including a "horrible reaction with steroids" she was taking at the time.</p><p>"I tried to cut it down, and then the brain would swell a little bit more, and the hand would stop working completely," she told <em>People</em>, explaining that she lost the ability to hold an object in her right hand for three months. "The first time a glass slipped right through my hand, I was like, 'No, no, no, no, no. This is not happening.'"</p><h2>Files for Divorce</h2><p>In April 2023, Shannen filed for divorce from her husband of 11 years<strong> Kurt Iswarienko</strong>, listing the separation date as Jan. 15, 2023 in documents obtained by E! News.</p><p>The <em>BH90210 </em>actress later accused Kurt of cheating on her during cancer treatments, saying that she learned of his alleged two-year affair moments before undergoing brain surgery.</p><p>"I went into that surgery early in the morning and I went in after I found out that my marriage was essentially over," Shannen shared in a December 2023 episode of <em>Let's Be Clear.</em> "I couldn't go into that surgery with him there. I felt so betrayed."</p><p>Kurt has not publicly addressed the allegations. E! News reached out to his rep for comment but didn’t hear back.</p><figure><img title="Files for Divorce" src="IMG/BB1psH85_files_for_divorce.jpg" alt="Files for Divorce"><figcaption><em>Files for Divorce.

"Do I call that a miracle? For me, that happens to be a miracle right now."</p><h2>In Treatment</h2><p>In preparation for another round of chemotherapy, Shannen shared that the procedures have left her "exhausted."</p><p>"It becomes very real in an incredibly different way," she said of her cancer journey on a June 2024 episode of her podcast, "because I have no idea how long I'm gonna be on the chemo for."  </p></main>
