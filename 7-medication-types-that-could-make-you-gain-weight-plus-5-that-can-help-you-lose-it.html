Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>At some point in our lives, most of us will need to take medication, either briefly or long term. Research shows approximately 46 percent of Americans are on a prescription medication.</p><h2>5 Classes of Medication Linked With Weight Loss</h2><p>Having a larger body may not be a health problem in itself, but carrying excess weight can pose challenges. Plus, for people with obesity, losing even a modest amount of weight (5 percent of starting body weight) can help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you would like to weigh less, the following medications could help you reach your goals.</p><h3>GLP-1s</h3><p>Initially designed to help manage type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 agonists such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), dulaglutide (Trulicity), and exenatide (Byetta) are also known for inducing weight loss. They work by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which has several functions, including stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin, managing blood sugar levels, slowing digestion, and increasing satiety, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>Together, these effects can reduce appetite, help people feel full faster after eating, and improve fat metabolism, says Ebne Rafi, PharmD, clinical pharmacy specialist at University Hospitals Diabetes and Metabolic Care Center in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.</p><p>People typically lose about 10 to 20 percent of their starting body weight when using these medications alongside a healthy diet and exercise routine, according to Harvard Health.</p><h3>Appetite Suppressants</h3><p>As the name suggests, these medications affect the central nervous system to curb hunger and help people eat less, Rafi says. Common examples include phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia) and bupropion/naltrexone (Contrave).</p><p>When these medications are combined with healthy diet and exercise, people generally lose around six to ten percent of their starting body weight. More specifically, one medical trial showed that average weight loss with Contrave is 6 percent of body weight; other research found that the average weight loss with Qsymia is 8 to 10 percent of body weight.</p><h3>Lipase Inhibitors</h3><p>Lipase inhibitors, such as orlistat (Alli, Xenical), decrease the amount of fat absorbed by the intestines, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It’s most beneficial when combined with a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet and regular exercise, per the National Library of Medicine.</p><p>One study found that after six months of orlistat use, the mean weight loss of participants was 5.6 kg (approximately 12.3 pounds), compared to 2.4 kg (5.3 pounds) in people taking a placebo. These medications can also help people maintain their weight after they’ve lost it, per the National Library of Medicine.</p><h3>Some Diabetes Medications</h3><p>GLP-1 agonists aren’t the only diabetes medications that can help people lose weight. Metformin, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors may also promote weight loss, says Reed Berger-Fleishman, MD, medical director of obesity programs, associate clinical professor of medicine and surgery, and physician nutrition specialist at University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>Metformin, a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes after diet and lifestyle changes, can reduce appetite by increasing the body’s sensitivity to hormones, such as insulin and leptin, and increasing levels of GLP-1 and peptide YY, a chemical that helps you feel full after eating, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It may also help with weight loss by altering the gut microbiome and improving fat metabolism, studies show.</p><p>With SGLT2 inhibitors, glucose from the blood is excreted into the urine, instead of being reabsorbed, after it’s filtered through the kidneys, according to research. This helps to lower blood sugar levels and prevent excess calories from being stored as fat. Although they’re thought to be most effective in people with type 2 diabetes, research suggests they can also be effective for people with obesity who don’t have type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors work by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose from the gut and reducing blood sugar levels and calorie intake. Some studies indicate they may also help to increase GLP-1 levels.</p><h3>Some Antidepressants</h3><p>The relationship between weight and antidepressants is complex, says Avlin Imaeda, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine and medical director, North Haven Endoscopy Center, at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.</p><p>Many antidepressants cause weight gain (more on that later), but several newer medications are considered “weight neutral,” in that they neither cause weight gain nor loss, says Ferrell Varner, MD, assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis.</p><p>Some medicines, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), fluoxetine (Prozac), and duloxetine (Cymbalta), can even promote weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping to curb cravings for sugary or high-fat foods, Rafi and Dr. Imaeda say.</p><h2>7 Medication Classes That Are Linked With Weight Gain</h2><p>One in five Americans are taking at least one medication that can cause weight gain, a study found. While exceptions exist, most drugs don’t cause the average patient to lose or gain more than a few pounds. That said, gaining even 5 to 20 pounds in adulthood is associated with a higher risk for health conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease, one study shows. Weight gain can also be disheartening if you’re trying to shift the scale in the other direction.</p><h3>Corticosteroids</h3><p>Doctors prescribe oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone (Rayos and Prednisone Intensol) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol), for a variety of conditions from allergies and asthma to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis, according to the Mayo Clinic. Because they can increase fluid retention and appetite and inhibit metabolism, weight gain is a common side effect — especially among long-term users, Rafi and Dr. Berger-Fleishman say.</p><p>“Ideally, no one is ever on prednisone for long periods,” Imaeda says. But when it is necessary, managing weight can be challenging, Rafi explains, mainly because there often aren’t comparable, weight-neutral alternatives.</p><p>Along with lifestyle interventions, such as eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly, Rafi and Berger-Fleishman say some patients may benefit from weight loss medications to counteract corticosteroid-related weight gain. </p><h3>Some Antidepressants</h3><p>“Many commonly prescribed antidepressants may cause weight gain,” says Varner, adding that long-term users are most likely to be affected. He and Imaeda say there are likely multiple reasons for this.</p><p>For one, they say, some antidepressants influence histamine and serotonin receptors, which may make people feel less full after meals and increase carb cravings and overall appetite. And tricyclic antidepressants, specifically amitriptyline (Elavil, Vanatrip), clomipramine (Anafranil), doxepin (Sinequan), and imipramine (Tofranil), may decrease metabolism, says Berger-Fleishman, who is a diplomate of the American Board of Obesity Medicine.</p><p>Also, Imaeda notes that people tend to behave differently when they’re depressed. Although some people eat more, others do the opposite, which can lead to involuntary weight loss, she explains. Once their depression starts to lift, their appetite — and weight — may return. “Some of it is behavior dependent, so it makes studying these very complicated,” she says.</p><p>Besides tricyclics, Varner, Imaeda, and Berger-Fleishman say the antidepressants most likely to cause weight gain include some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and the tetracyclic mirtazapine. Examples of SSRIs include escitalopram (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). Phenelzine (Nardil) and isocarboxazid (Marplan) are common MAOIs.</p><p>“Among the commonly prescribed antidepressants, fluoxetine (Prozac), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Khedezla), vortioxetine (Trintellix), vilazodone (Viibyrd), and bupropion (Wellbutrin) are the least likely to cause weight gain,” Varner says.</p><p>It’s imperative to not stop taking antidepressants abruptly, as doing so can lead to withdrawals or a relapse in depression, according to Harvard Health. Generally, withdrawals aren’t medically dangerous, but can cause several unpleasant side effects, ranging from irritability to insomnia to digestive trouble. If weight gain is a concern, talk to your doctor about switching to a weight-neutral alternative.</p><h3>Antipsychotics</h3><p>Doctors may prescribe antipsychotic medications to treat mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression. Some of these, particularly “second generation” drugs such as olanzapine (Zyprexa, Zentiva), are known to cause significant weight gain, Rafi and Berger-Fleishman say. Additionally, Rafi says these drugs can impair glucose metabolism, increase insulin resistance, and raise cholesterol and triglyceride levels. According to research, this may raise patients’ risk of conditions like cardiovascular disease.</p><p>One meta-analysis found olanzapine and clozapine (Clozaril, FazaClo ODT) are most likely to cause weight gain. Ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify, Aristada), and lurasidone (Latuda) are less likely to do so.</p><p>If you’re on antipsychotic medications and weight gain is a concern, talk to your doctor about switching to a more weight-neutral alternative. Your doctor might also suggest taking another medication, such as metformin, to counteract medication-related weight gain, Berger-Fleishman says.</p><h3>Beta-Blockers</h3><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, beta-blockers are used to help treat and prevent several conditions — such as high blood pressure, heart failure, glaucoma, and migraines — and though experts aren’t sure why these cause weight gain, many healthcare providers think they may decrease metabolism. Berger-Fleishman says that older beta-blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), and propranolol, are more likely to cause weight gain. In contrast, newer iterations, such as carvedilol (Coreg), tend to be weight-neutral.</p><p>If you’re taking a beta-blocker to address heart failure, tell your doctor immediately if you gain more than 2 to 3 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week, the Mayo Clinic warns. This may be due to fluid buildup, which could indicate the condition is getting worse.</p><p>If you’re taking a beta-blocker for hypertension, Imaeda suggests asking your doctor about an alternative. While a beta-blocker is essential to treat heart failure, there are better options for blood pressure management.</p><h3>Antihistamines</h3><p>Most people use antihistamines periodically to treat allergies, hives, nasal congestion, or rashes and won’t see any change in their weight. However, long-term use often leads to weight gain, Rafi says. That’s because, besides playing a crucial role in allergic reactions, histamines turn off hunger signals and promote wakefulness, according to the Obesity Medicine Association.</p><p>First-generation antihistamines are more likely to cause weight gain than newer formulations, which don’t cross the blood-brain barrier to the same extent, say Rafi, Imaeda, and Berger-Fleishman. One of these, cyproheptadine (Periactin), is even used to increase appetite and induce weight gain in people whose low weight is problematic, research shows. Examples of newer antihistamines that are more weight neutral include loratadine (Alavert, Claritin) and cetirizine (Allacan, Zyrtec Allergy).</p><p>Alternatively, you might try nasal steroid sprays or eye drops to relieve symptoms without the risk of weight gain, according to the University of Washington.</p><h3>Epilepsy Medications</h3><p>Research indicates obesity can raise the risk of certain kinds of epilepsy, while having epilepsy can increase the likelihood of developing obesity, according to the Defeating Epilepsy Foundation. This is partly because of how epilepsy affects the brain, including hormones that regulate appetite, satiety, and metabolism, according to the foundation. Some anti-seizure medications can also increase appetite, potentially leading to weight gain. These include valproate (Dyzantil, Epilim), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Curatil), gabapentin (Horizant, Gralise), and pregabalin (Lyrica), according to the Mayo Clinic and Berger-Fleishman. If you’re concerned about weight gain, consider asking your doctor about alternatives, such as topiramate (Topamax, Topiragen) and zonisamide (Zonegran), which Berger-Fleishman says are associated with weight loss.</p><h3>Other Diabetes Medications</h3><p>If you have diabetes, you might need to take medication, such as insulin, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones, to regulate your blood sugar (glucose). Rafi says insulin and sulfonylureas tend to cause weight gain because insulin is a growth hormone. Specifically, according to the Cleveland Clinic, insulin helps the body absorb glucose and transport it to cells. Glucose comes from food, drinks, and the body’s reserves. While glucose is crucial to power all parts of the body, particularly the brain and nervous system, that which isn’t used for energy is stored as fat, according to Oklahoma State University. </p><h2>Talking to Your Doctor About Weight-Related Side Effects</h2><p>Whenever your doctor prescribes a new medication, ask them what it’s used for and what its side effects are, Imaeda and Berger-Fleishman say. Many medicines are vital to treat serious conditions, and they say the most important thing is finding an effective product. However, there are sometimes weight-neutral options available.</p><h2>How to Manage Your Weight While on Medication</h2><p>Taking a holistic approach to weight management and health can be helpful, too, says Maggie Bell, RD, RN, owner of Maggie Bell Nutrition and Wellness in Little Rock, Arkansas. While a medication’s effects on your weight or energy level might require you to adjust your goals, they don’t have to derail your efforts. Bell and Berger-Fleishman say the following lifestyle adjustments can help manage medication-related weight changes and maintain overall well-being.</p><h3>Prioritize Whole Foods</h3><p>Including a balance of lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and beneficial fat at every meal can help stabilize blood sugar levels, which may improve energy and facilitate weight management, they say. Additionally, Berger-Fleishman says that eating lots of low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables can help you avoid overdoing it with less healthy foods. Examples of such eating plans include the Mediterranean and DASH diets, according to the Cleveland Clinic and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, respectively.</p><h3>Eat More Protein</h3><p>“If you’re choosing between two foods with 100 calories, choose the one with more protein,” Berger-Fleishman says. “Protein, fat, and fiber all help with fullness, so the higher-protein food will give more satiety. Also, calorie for calorie, protein ‘burns more calories.’ There is a higher thermogenic effect when you eat protein.” Research on protein intake and energy expenditure supports this. </p><h3>Try to Manage Stress</h3><p>“High stress levels trigger the release of hormones like cortisol, which can contribute to weight gain,” Bell says. “I advise my clients to incorporate stress-reducing practices such as breathwork, meditation, and self-care activities into their daily routines to mitigate the effects of stress on weight.” Yoga can also be helpful, according to research.</p><h3>Move Your Body</h3><p>“I encourage my clients to get at least 7,000 steps per day and exercise at least three to four times weekly,” Bell says, adding that exercising outdoors can have additional benefits for energy levels and general well-being. “Even on low-energy days, spending time outdoors can have a revitalizing effect,” she says. If long workouts are intimidating or you don’t have the time or energy for them, Bell suggests starting with short, 10- to 15-minute sessions and gradually building up as you can.</p><p>Notably, Bell and Berger-Fleishman say that healthy habits can still help you feel better even if the scale doesn’t move the way you’d like — and may reduce your risk of complications or additional health problems.</p><p>“I empathize with those experiencing weight gain due to medications, having gone through a similar journey myself in 2021,” Bell says. “It’s a challenging time, but I urge people not to lose hope and to continue advocating for their health. In addition, practicing self-compassion is crucial. Avoid negative self-talk and remember that this journey is temporary; with perseverance and support, improvements will come.”</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
