    <main><h1>17 Things that Can Damage the Indoor Air Quality in Your Home</h1><p><p>Many products we use in our homes, as well as activities we participate in, could seriously contaminate the air we breathe, putting our health at risk. Today, we’re providing you with the top 17 known causes of indoor air pollution and how they harm us.</p><h2>Mold and Mildew</h2><p>Mold and mildew thrive in damp, humid areas in your home, such as the bathroom and basement. They produce mycotoxins, which affect the muscles. Whether it’s the mold itself or the spores it releases into the air, this fungus is also known to cause respiratory issues and allergic reactions.</p><h2>Pesticides</h2><p>We learn from the U.S. EPA that pesticides contain hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and VOCs. Pesticides are highly-concentrated pollutants that don’t just affect you indoors but can also cause damage to whole neighborhoods and communities. Long exposure to some can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, muscle spasms, cancer, and even death.</p><figure><img title="Pesticides" src="IMG/BB1n2e0C_pesticides.jpg" alt="Pesticides"><figcaption><em>Pesticides.

Tobacco smoke contains a high concentration of harmful fine particle matter, chemicals, and carcinogens that settle on furniture or linger in the air for up to four hours.</p><h2>Household Cleaning Products</h2><p>Many cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products we use at home contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evaporate into the air and cause problems like headaches, respiratory issues, and eye irritation. Fragranced products additionally contain phthalates, which are associated with hormonal disruptions.</p><figure><img title="Household Cleaning Products" src="IMG/BB1m6C2j_household_cleaning_products.jpg" alt="Household Cleaning Products"><figcaption><em>Household Cleaning Products.

Dander refers to the tiny particles of skin shed by pets that settle on carpets, upholstery, and bedding—the very particles that make someone allergic to dogs or cats.</p><h2>Cooking and Cooking Appliances</h2><p>Gas stoves release carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide into the air, causing pollution 400% higher than when you use electric stoves to cook. While odorless and colorless carbon monoxide inhibits oxygen intake, nitrogen dioxide can damage our respiratory tract and cause existing respiratory problems.</p><h2>Air Fresheners</h2><p>As the Washington Post shares, “whether it's an aerosol bottle, plug-in, oil, scented candle, or gel, if a product promises to clear smells, chances are it harbors toxins that pollute indoor air quality.” The chemicals in deodorizers used to generate fragrances are VOCs that could worsen asthma and other respiratory issues.</p><h2>New Furniture and Carpets</h2><p>When you’re buying new carpets or furniture, you have to make sure they aren’t produced using harmful chemicals like formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a known irritant to our skin and respiratory tract that could cause dizziness and burns. Emissions from carpets and furniture could last for months after your purchase.</p><h2>Paints and Solvents</h2><p>Paints are also popular vectors for VOCs like formaldehyde and benzene, which are released into the air as they dry up. These can cause headaches, nausea, and dizziness almost immediately after inhalation, and a lack of ventilation worsens exposure. Thankfully, low—and zero-VOC alternatives exist, so you should go for them.</p><h2>Personal Care Products</h2><p>While fragrances from them are primary concerns, an NIH paper explains how personal care products (PCPs) also release biologically active and inactive ingredients into the air. If you’d like to protect the atmosphere and your own health, it’s best to use natural, fragrance-free products.</p><h2>Dust</h2><p>It isn’t the dust itself we have to worry about, but the dust mites they harbor. Dust mites are tiny, insect-like pests that accumulate in carpets, bedding, upholstered furniture, and even HVAC filters, causing allergic reactions and possibly triggering asthma. One excellent way to control them is to always use HEPA filters in your home.</p><figure><img title="Dust" src="IMG/BB1n2god_dust.jpg" alt="Dust"><figcaption><em>Dust.

HVAC systems harbor bacteria and viruses when they’re not cleaned regularly, and they also circulate harmful substances like dust and mold while they work.</p><h2>Fireplaces</h2><p>According to the Guardian, fireplaces and any apparatus used to burn wood to stay warm indoors are also significant sources of indoor air pollution. By using them, you release tiny wood particles into the air, which are particularly harmful to older and younger people.</p><h2>Radon Gas</h2><p>Randon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that the WHO tells us is found in high concentrations in homes and workplaces. It typically seeps into the home through its foundation, especially homes built over uranium. Radon gas is one of the leading causes of lung cancer.</p><figure><img title="Radon Gas" src="IMG/BB1mUt90_radon_gas.jpg" alt="Radon Gas"><figcaption><em>Radon Gas.

Incense smoke, when inhaled, is known to cause respiratory dysfunction by polluting the airways with particulate matter, harmful gases, and other organic compounds.</p><h2>Building Materials and Insulation</h2><p>When we talk about building materials, the most dangerous are asbestos and fiber glass, which release harmful fumes and tiny particles into the air. Some wood materials also contain formaldehyde, while adhesives, solvents, and mastics could emit VOCs at dangerous levels.</p><h2>Construction and Renovation Activities</h2><p>Now, separate from the construction materials themselves, there are other things you come in contact with during demolition or rebuilding operations. Disruptions caused by construction work expose us to irritants and harmful materials like mold, lead, and even bird waste, increasing particles in the air by over 20%.</p><h2>Up Next: 17 Phrases Older People Use That No One Else Gets</h2><p>Each and every generation has its own phrases and sayings that separate it from the rest, and the boomers certainly have plenty.
