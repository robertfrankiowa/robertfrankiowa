    <main><h1>We Found the Absolute Best Workout Shoes for All Kinds of Exercises</h1><p><strong>MUCH LIKE</strong> any menswear staple, finding the right pair of workout shoes depends on the occasion. Sure, you can get by wearing whatever's allowed on the gym floor for general strength training, interval workouts, and studio classes. But if you want to make the most of your workouts, you'll use trainers that are designed for the type of exercise you're doing.</p><p>Essentially, the best workout shoes for men offer design advantages specific to the activities they're meant to be used for. If you're training for a half marathon, consider investing in running shoes featuring plenty of responsive cushioning that can handle lots of mileage. A group HIIT class calls for a cross trainer with a larger base and secure fit to get you through a variety of workouts. Meanwhile, for weightlifting, the best workout shoes for men have a more restrictive upper and a stable outsole to help maintain proper form and reduce lower back strain, especially for squats and deadlifts.</p><p>For the past few years, <em>MH </em>fitness editors and experts, including Senior Fitness Editor Brett Williams, NASM, have tested dozens of the best workout shoes for men. From HIIT classes to CrossFit WODs, we've put these shoes through the wringer to evaluate them on their comfort, fit, support, performance, and, of course, value. We also sought expertise from top podiatrists including Dr. Mark Mendeszoon to understand what factors make a for a great workout shoe.</p><p>Ready to shop for a new pair to be your go-to workout sneakers? Keep scrolling to check out our list of the 19 best workout shoes for men for all types of activity.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Nike Free Metcon 5</h2><p class="body-text">Nike's Metcon line has long been a favorite in CrossFit boxes, and the Free line is a versatile trainer that's just as good for your set of squats as it is for short runs.</p><p>We found this trainer to be strong, stable, and flexible. Essentially, it's built to help you squeeze every ounce of performance from your training program. We love the extra support in the heel and at the midfoot, which adds stability and support to help you power through sets. Next-gen chain-link mesh keeps you cool through even the most intense agility drills. What more could you really ask for?</p><p class="body-text"><strong>What do buyers say?</strong> "This shoe fits and feels fantastic, the shoes feels pretty comfortable and very responsive. The feel of these shoes gives you a low-to-the-ground feeling while still providing good support," said one Nike customer. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Altra Solstice XT 2</strong> </h2><p>The beauty of Altra's remodeled Solstice is its goldilocks design, which, in our experience testing, strikes the perfect balance between stability and cushion. Unlike a ton of great workout shoes, we found this shoe can be comfortably worn for both quick runs and cross-training alike. </p><p>Just like its OG predecessor, these Altras have a reinforced cage and toe box, plus a full rubber outsole for added durability. While we didn't have any problems with the durability of the Solstice XT 2, it's worth mentioning some reviewers had qualms about the shoe breaking down quicker than expected. Most of these instances seemed to come with high-intensity training and lifting, where scuffing and abrasion can occur. Nevertheless, the Solstice XT2 is a solid workout shoe pick, especially if you lean towards a wider foot than a narrow one.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>"<em>I have had three pairs of these and they have all been very durable. I actually have been playing doubles tennis in my newest pair without any breakdown in the shoe,</em>"said one Altra reviewer. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Mizuno TC-11</strong></h2><p>If you need a do-it-all pair of trainers, go for Mizuno's marquee trainers. The TC 11 is designed with Mizuno's C.O.B. technology, a patent-pending design featuring sensor pod clusters that enable enhanced feedback from the feet to aid in balance and, ultimately, allow you to pursue improved athletic performance. Their low design allows the foot to sit more naturally with the ground, which makes it ideal for any type of activity with weights involved. However, the downside to the low design is the shoe caters to individuals with low arches rather than high. So if you have high arches, it might be worth examining what type of inserts you can add or find a more cushioned trainer on this list with ample support to keep a proper balance.</p><p>Overall, we found the TC 11 to be incredibly well-balanced and worthy of our top pick. You can wear these for cross-training, weightlifting, cardio and body weight training classes, and more.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Brooks Adrenaline GTS 22</strong></h2><p>Podiatrist Mark J. Mendeszoon, DPM, FACFAS, swears by this bestseller from Brooks for most runs. "It provides the perfect amount of support and cushioning," he says. "As most feet style falls into this category." He also notes the smooth ride it provides, thanks to its proprietary cushion midsole that's extra soft. </p><p>We feel what's really great about the GTS series is they always come with a wide array of colors to choose from. The GTS 22 also is available in four different widths: B (Narrow), D (Medium), EE (Wide), and 4E (X-Wide), so there's truly something for everyone. We found the only (sort of) downside to be the thin and breathable upper, which is great for running, but cancels it out for any type of weightlifting or high-intensity training. Stick to the running workouts and sprints in these bad boys.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>"<em>This is my second pair of Brooks Adrenaline 22's. I have crazy wide and flat feet, and so good fitting shoes are hard to find. These work great for me</em>," said one Zappos Brooks Adrenaline GTS 22 buyer. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>GORUCK Ballistic Trainers</strong></h2><p>These GORUCK trainers have 3X Support™ and 3X Stability for all three of your arches (the medial longitudinal arch, the lateral longitudinal arch, and the anterior transverse arch). Squat, lunge, or ruck, we loved that these shoes can take a beating. </p><p>Featuring a streamlined, minimalist design, we found them easy on the eyes <em>and </em>feet. Another excellent feature they have is a secure lacing system, which makes a huge difference when trying to max out—weightlifters all know how frustrating it can be when your shoe laces keep stretching and loosening up. But, in our experience, the best aspect about these shoes is their lifespan. It takes a while for them to truly break down to the point of needing replacing.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>"<em>If I was only going to buy one pair of cross training shoes these are it</em>," said one GORUCK customer. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Nike Metcon 9</h2><p>The Metcon 8 is the ideal CrossFit shoe and is built for everything that comes with CrossFit, according to Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., <em>MH</em> Fitness Director. </p><p>We found it has just enough forefoot flex to work for box jumps, quick curved-treadmill sprints, and rows, while still offering enough stability for key CrossFit lifts like snatches, squats, and deadlifts. Little touches complete the package: The textured inside offers an ever-so-slight grip when you're doing rope climbs, and the Velcro that secures your laces solves the greatest problem of early Metcons (the way the laces too-easily came untied).</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Under Armour HOVR Rise 4</strong></h2><figure><img title="zappos.com" src="IMG/AA1l6ymM_hovr_rise_4.jpg" alt="Hovr Rise 4"><figcaption><em>Hovr Rise 4. zappos.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>These UA shoes are great for cross-training thanks to their TriBase™, which maximizes ground contact, promotes natural motion, and provides flexibility to grip during lifts. </p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>"<em>Super comfortable and super light so I can train hard. As someone that trains functional, I do all kinds of movements and this shoe definitely takes care of it all,</em>"said one Under Armour customer.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Reebok Nano X3</strong></h2><p>Reebok's latest CrossFit-centric Nano X model is perfect for cross-trainers (and CrossFitters) alike thanks to Floatride Energy Foam cushioning. </p><p><strong><strong>What do buyers say? </strong></strong>"<em>Excellent shoe for weightlifting. My one reason for giving it 4 stars is they run a bit narrow,</em>"said one Reebok reviewer.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Reebok J.J. IV </strong> </h2><figure><img title="reebok.com" src="IMG/AAX5fKq_reebok_jj_iv_men.jpg" alt="Reebok J.J. IV Men"><figcaption><em>Reebok J.J. IV Men's Training Shoes. reebok.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>These Reeboks were specifically designed for NFL great J.J. Watt's cross-training sessions. If they're good enough for him, they're definitely good enough for us mere mortals.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>Out of more than 280 Amazon review, 91% of buyers recommend the Reebok J.J. IVs with at least a 4-star rating. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>NOBULL Trainer</strong> </h2><p>NOBULL is a CrossFit-first company, and these trainers have high carbon lateral and medial guards for added protection on sidewalls perfect for cross-training. </p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>Out of more than 14,107 NOBULL reviews, 96% of buyers recommend the Trainers with at least a 4-star rating. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Vivobarefoot Primus Lite III</strong></h2><p>£135.00</p><p>This iconic model from Vivobarefoot simulates the experience of being barefoot while protecting your feet from the risk involved with going shoe-free. It's designed to be foot shaped—not shoe shaped—with a super wide toe box that allows your feet to move how they would without the constraints of a traditional shoe. The benefit being you can grip the ground more effectively and exercise your foot's dexterity while working out.</p><p>We love that despite its minimalist approach, it offers a 4mm sole to protect your foot from whatever may be in your path and extra lamination around the toe for an added buffer from the environment. One downside: the lack of support these shoes provide takes some getting used to, and may not be suitable for those with special arch concerns.</p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong>People who wear these say they hold up to more abuse than shoes twice their weight, and can stay in great condition no matter what you put them through. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Adidas Dropset Trainers</strong></h2><figure><img title="adidas.com" src="IMG/AA1l6sRF_dropset_training_shoes.jpg" alt="Dropset Training Shoes"><figcaption><em>Dropset Training Shoes. adidas.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>Adidas' trainers are incredibly versatile. Made with a dual-intensity midsole and a stiff heel, it's both supportive and comfortable, and works double duty for interval training and cardio workouts. Plus, half of its upper is made with recycled goods. </p><p><strong>What do buyers say? </strong><em>"I was having issues with my quads and putting pressure on the [metatarsal] pads of my feet was killing them. These shoes correct that and keep all the pressure on my heel pads. I can now go longer with more weight and no pain</em>," said one buyer on the Adidas site.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Shop More Great Workout Shoes</strong></h2><h3 class="body-h3">Salomon Aero Glide</h3><p>Salomon steps out of its trail shoe comfort zone to deliver this max-cushioned trainer that works well for daily runs.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Under Armour Flow Dynamic Training Shoes</h3><p>A bouncy training shoe that’s great for athletic moves and extra-breathable for long sessions, thanks to its UA Intelliknit upper.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Asics GT-2000</h3><p>A balanced and stable daily trainer that offers a smooth ride regardless of distance, while also offering enough versatility for your gym workouts, too.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Hoka Solimar</h3><p>A solid jack-of-all-trades shoe that thrives whether you’re walking, going out for a quick run, or getting a quick weight-room workout (although we wish it had a bit more lateral stability).</p><h3 class="body-h3">Skechers Go Run Ride</h3><figure><img title="roadrunners.com" src="IMG/AA1l6sRI_go_run_ride.jpg" alt="Go Run Ride"><figcaption><em>Go Run Ride. roadrunners.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>An ultra-affordable runner that offers a nice cushioned ride and delivers a wider sole for added stability.</p><h3 class="body-h3">On Cloudsurfer</h3><p>A well-built lightweight daily trainer that, like all On shoes, is all about its magical cushioning and comfort.</p><p>APL’s first-ever training shoe delivers a lace-locking system that keeps you from having to retie your shoes and terrific lateral stability for skater hops, shuffles, and anything your next Barry’s showdown can throw at you.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>How to Choose the Best Workout Shoes (for You)</strong></h2><p>Ready to step up your workout shoe game? We're here to help you navigate the wild world of athletic sneaker to get the right pair of kicks on your feet. So, listen up and let's dive in:</p><p><strong>Know your workout style</strong>: First things first, figure out what kind of workouts you're into. Are you a HIIT junkie, lifting heavyweights, or a bit of both? Different shoes are designed for different activities, so you want to make sure you're getting the right shoe for your specific workout style.</p><p><strong>Cushioning</strong>: When it comes to workout shoes, cushioning is your best friend. Look for shoes with ample cushioning in the midsole to absorb impact and protect your joints, especially if you'll be HIITing regularly. Trust us, your knees will thank you later!</p><p><strong>Grip</strong>: Don't let slippery shoes ruin your workout. Opt for shoes with good traction, especially if you're doing a lot of dynamic movements or hitting the trails. You want that sturdy grip to keep you stable and prevent any embarrassing slips.</p><p><strong>Comfort</strong>: A true non-negotiable. Your feet deserve some serious TLC, especially during those intense workouts. Look for shoes with a comfortable fit that provide proper arch support and a snug, yet not too tight, feel. Remember, you'll be spending some quality time with these shoes, so make sure they're kind to your feet.</p><p><strong>Breathability</strong>: Let those puppies breathe! Look for shoes with breathable mesh or perforated uppers. Nobody wants sweaty, stinky feet, right? Opting for breathable shoes will keep your feet cool and comfortable, even during the sweatiest workouts.</p><p><strong>Style</strong>: Okay, we know functionality is important, but style matters too! Find a shoe that not only performs well but also makes you feel confident and pumped to hit the gym. When you look good, you feel good, and that can give you an extra boost of motivation.</p><p><strong>Fit</strong>: Don't be that guy squeezing his feet into shoes that are way too small. Make sure you get the right size! Take the time to measure your feet properly and follow the brand's size chart. Remember, your feet might swell during workouts, so account for a little wiggle room.</p><p><strong>Budget</strong>: Workout shoes come in all price ranges. While top-of-the-line shoes can be tempting, you can still find fantastic options that won't break the bank. Set a budget and explore different brands and models within that range. You might be surprised at the quality you can get without draining your wallet.</p><h2 class="body-h2"> Why You Can Trust Us</h2><p>At <em>Men's Health</em>, we take great pride in providing our readers with reliable and trustworthy product recommendations.
