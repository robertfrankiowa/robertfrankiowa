Canada</em></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>For energy</strong></h3><p>Every morning, I take glutathione on an empty stomach. It’s a master antioxidant that naturally occurs in the body but decreases as we age.</p><p>I take glutathione in liquid liposomal form which absorbs quickly into my body. This not only supports energy production in cells but is also important to my cardiovascular health. </p><p>I also have a B12 shot every two to three months, which supports energy function. As we age, our bodies tend to have a harder time absorbing B12 from food, but it's essential for red blood cell formation as well as cognitive function.</p><p><strong>DISCOVER: </strong>What a 51-year-old PT wants you to know about exercise in menopause</p><h3><strong>For bone health</strong></h3><p>I also take a vitamin D3 supplement every day which helps with the absorption of calcium in my diet for good bone health.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Hello!

As we age, our digestive processes naturally slow down, and even with a healthy, whole food diet rich in fibre, I’ve found that adding a good probiotic helps my body continue to fire on all cylinders, keeps my gut healthy and my energy high.</p><p><strong>DISCOVER: </strong>Happy gut, happy mind: how your gut health imp​acts your mood</p><h3><strong>For workout recovery</strong></h3><p>Eighteen years ago I developed my signature HSM Smoothie which I refer to as jet fuel. It includes 27 grams of protein, 20 grams of fibre, healthy fat (avocado), phytonutrients, vitamin C and fresh organic berries at approximately 327 calories, depending on the amount of fruit, citrus and herbs I use. It not only fuels my workout, but sets me up for success nutritionally for the whole day.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Hello!
