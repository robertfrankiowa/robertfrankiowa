    <main><h1>These Hamstring Stretches Help You Stay Limber and Pain-Free, According to Experts</h1><p> [table-of-contents] stripped </p><p class="body-text">Muscle tightness is never fun, but rock-hard hamstrings are real day ruiners. That’s because hamstrings, the group of muscles that run along the back of the thigh from hip to knee, are “vital skeletal muscles that allow us to walk, climb stairs, and perform many daily tasks,” explains Melissa Bentivoglio, a certified pilates instructor and co-founder of Frame Fitness. Daily hamstring stretches to stay limber, therefore, are essential. “By stretching our hamstrings, we experience a greater range of motion, flexibility, and improved circulation,” Bentivogolio adds. </p><p class="body-tip">Meet the Experts: Melissa Bentivoglio, a certified pilates instructor and co-founder of Frame Fitness; and Maeve McEwen, C.P.T., a certified personal trainer and director of programming and head trainer at Pvolve.</p><p class="body-text">If you struggle with hip or lower back pain, hamstring stretches may also help improve mobility and prevent injury in those areas, adds Maeve McEwen, C.P.T., a certified personal trainer and director of programming and head trainer at Pvolve. That’s because the hamstrings attach to the sits bone at the bottom of the pelvis, she explains. “Many of us sit for hours with our pelvis tucked under, and gently stretching the hamstrings can help reduce some of that compression and tightness in that area,” McEwen adds.</p><p class="body-text">In short, if you include hamstrings into a regular stretch routine, “your body will thank you later,” Bentivogolio stresses. Keep reading to learn how.</p><h2 class="body-h2">How to perform hamstring stretches safely</h2><p>Before you launch into intense lunges, both Bentivogolio and McEwen have tips for ensuring safe stretching, especially if you’re a beginner. Most importantly: Don’t force anything. “Ease into the movements. Start in a smaller range of motion and begin to take deep inhales and long slow exhales,” says McEwen. “Use props like bands, chairs, or holding onto a wall to ensure you’re moving in your body’s true range rather than forcing or compensating with other muscles.”</p><p>Bentivogolio stresses going at your own pace and not comparing yourself to others, as everyone’s flexibility is different. “If you experience sharp pain or discomfort, stop stretching as you want to avoid overstretching your muscles,” she adds. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Easy hamstring stretches to try at home</h2><p>Below, both trainers share a few basic, easy moves to get you started. Bentivogolio recommends warming up first with a quick jog in place to get the blood flowing. Also, again, don’t forget to breathe. “Breathing deeply and consistently helps to not only relax the muscles, but it also improves circulation and can help get rid of lactic acid buildup,” she says. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Standing forward bend </h3><figure><img title="HRAUN - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1hzivP_gettyimages_1128394451.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1128394451"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-1128394451.

Reach your hands toward the floor or the backs of your legs,” says Bentivogolio. “Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds, feeling the stretch in your hamstrings.” McEwen adds: “Keep a long spine, weight in your heels, and your knees stacked over your ankles as you slowly hinge your hips back.”</p><h3 class="body-h3">Seated forward bend</h3><p>“Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Hinge at your hips and reach forward toward your toes,” says Bentivogolio. “Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your spine. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds.” </p><h3 class="body-h3">Wall hamstring stretch</h3><figure><img title="tmarvin - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1hzivW_gettyimages_172677118.jpg" alt="gettyimages-172677118"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-172677118. tmarvin - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>“Lie on your back with your hips close to a wall. Extend one leg up the wall while keeping the other foot flat on the floor,” says Bentivogolio. “Feel the stretch in the back of your extended leg. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds and switch legs.” </p><h3 class="body-h3">Lying hamstring stretch</h3><figure><img title="yasindmrblk - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1hzn84_gettyimages_1648215494.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1648215494"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-1648215494. yasindmrblk - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>“Lie on your back and bend one knee toward your chest. Loop a towel or strap around the ball of your foot. Straighten your leg while holding onto the towel, feeling the stretch in your hamstring,” Bentivogolio says. If you don’t have either of those props, you can simply hold the back of your thigh or calf—whatever you can reach comfortably without straining, McEwen notes. She also recommends keeping a gentle point through the top of the lifted foot. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds before switching legs.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Chair hamstring stretch</h3><p>“Sit on the edge of a chair with one leg extended straight. Keep your heel on the floor and toes pointing upward,” Bentivogolio says. “Hinge at your hips and lean forward, feeling the stretch in your hamstring. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds and switch legs.” </p><h3 class="body-h3">Knee-to-chest stretch</h3><p>“Lie on your back and bring one knee toward your chest. Hold onto your knee with both hands,” Bentivogolio says. Straighten the other leg, with your foot pointed toward the ceiling, she adds. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds, then switch legs.</p><figure><img title="RealPeopleGroup - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1hzddh_gettyimages_1445836273.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1445836273"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-1445836273. RealPeopleGroup - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sit on the floor or on a yoga mat with your legs spread wide apart. Hinge at your hips and reach forward, keeping your back straight, Bentivogolio says. “Hold onto your shins or feet, feeling the stretch in your inner thighs and hamstrings,” she adds. “Hold for 15 to 30 seconds.” </p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
