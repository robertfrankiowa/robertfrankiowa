    <main><h1>Try The Women's Health Self-Care Challenge</h1><p>When you think of self-care, a mani-pedi or massage might come to mind. But not everyone has the time or resources to splurge every week. Plus, what happens when you do, and you still feel like your cup is empty afterwards?</p><p>“We're in this era where self-care is talked about a lot, but no one really talks about how it impacts you,” says Kiaundra Jackson, LMFT, award-winning family therapist, speaker, and best-selling author based in Los Angeles. A lot of times, those fancy self-care treatments actually aren’t the most effective way to fill your cup—that’s why the key is to implement simple, sustainable self-care snacks into your daily routine.</p><p>Enter: The<em> Women’s Health</em> Self-Care Challenge. Each day, check our Instagram for new expert-approved activities, tools, and tricks to nourish your mind and body. Plus, Women's Health+ members get access to each challenge a day early, so stay tuned for your exclusive sneak peak!</p><p>Ready to revamp your self-care routine? Here's how:</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Day 1: Set yourself up for self-care success.</strong></h2><p>Today, reflect on why you’re doing this challenge and why self-care matters to you. If you’re someone who gives a lot, between work, children, a spouse, or to the world in general, this challenge will be extremely beneficial. “The only way you're going to be able to sustain that long-term is to make sure you're taken care of so you have the capacity to take care of other people,” Jackson says.</p><p>This week, you’ll pour back into your own cup and make sure it’s not only full, but also overflowing. When you make self-care a daily or weekly practice and part of your lifestyle—instead of only practicing it in emergency situations where you’ve already let your cup run dry—you will have excess love to give to others, Jackson says. Remember, self-care is not selfish, it's necessary.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Day 2: Block off your calendar.</strong></h2><p>Create a recurring non-negotiable event on your calendar that is truly *your time* to do anything that makes you feel good. This will look differently for everyone, depending on how busy your schedule is and what type of activity (or activities) you can do during that time. Here are a few ideas for each timeframe:</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>5 Minutes:</strong></h4><ul><li>Take some deep breaths.</li><li>Drink a glass of water. </li><li>Dance to your favorite song.</li></ul><h4 class="body-h4">30 Minutes: </h4><ul><li>Go for a walk. </li><li>Listen to a podcast.</li><li>Tidy up your bedroom.</li></ul><h4 class="body-h4">1 Hour:</h4><ul><li>Curl up with a good book.</li><li>Practice a hobby.</li><li>Watch your favorite TV show.</li></ul><ul><li>Get out and enjoy nature. </li><li>Catch up with an old friend. </li><li>Try a new restaurant.</li></ul><p> “If it's not a part of your routine and on your calendar, it's not going to happen,” says Jackson. And it’s crucial to prioritize these scheduled moments of self-care, rather than glaze over the reminder. “No matter what you're doing, as long as it’s not an emergency, you can stop working,” says Jackson. Don’t skip out on your plans with yourself!</p></main>
