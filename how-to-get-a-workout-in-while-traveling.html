    <main><h1>How to Get a Workout in While Traveling</h1><h2>Find an online tutorial</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to get a workout in while traveling is to look something up online. One of the best places to search is YouTube where there are specific fitness channels and videos for any type of workout you may want to do on the road. From bodyweight only to a quick HIIT routine, to a yoga flow, there are so many options online to help you get a workout in while traveling.</p><h2>Go for a bike ride</h2><p>Many cities and larger towns have bike rentals, so take out a bicycle and get a ride in. Not only is it a good way to get in a sweat session, but you can also explore your new surroundings and see the city you’re visiting from a cool new perspective.</p><figure><img title="Go for a bike ride" src="IMG/AA1hs0b0_go_for_a_bike_ride.jpg" alt="Go for a bike ride"><figcaption><em>Go for a bike ride.

Check your membership to see what your membership level covers. If you do not have an unlimited membership to all gym or studio locations, see if you can pay an additional fee so you can have access to a different location while you’re out of town.</p><h2>Check the hotel</h2><p>Depending on where your travel takes you, the hotel or resort may offer complimentary fitness classes onsite that are covered by the cost of your stay. At check-in, ask the concierge or front desk for an events calendar and see if that is an option for you. At the very least, they may have a free or cheap gym on site.</p><h2>Take a hike</h2><p>Another easy way to get a workout in while traveling is to look for local hiking trails. Whether you have access to a forest preserve, a nature walking path, or a nearby park, explore what hiking options are available to you during your stay. If you are lucky enough to be staying near a state park or national park, it’s absolutely worth a day trip to check it out. Just be sure to do your research and be ready get any park passes you may need.</p><h2>Look up local events</h2><p>Another option to get a workout in while traveling is to check out the community center or local park district website, and all of their social media channels. Depending on your destination, there may be complimentary classes held outdoors for locals, and maybe you! Think of things like mat pilates, yoga, or Tai Chi.</p><figure><img title="Look up local events" src="IMG/AA1hs2NS_look_up_local_events.jpg" alt="Look up local events"><figcaption><em>Look up local events.

Before you book that trip, explore the app and see what options are available to you when you hit the road.</p><figure><img title="Open up an app" src="IMG/AA1hs7Ep_open_up_an_app.jpg" alt="Open up an app"><figcaption><em>Open up an app. d3sign - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Go for a sight-seeing run</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to get a workout in while traveling is to lace up those running shoes and hit the pavement. Look for a local- approved running trail or find a scenic park you can take a few laps around. When checking out any parks or trails, be sure to ask about any wildlife you may need to watch out for. Safety first! And definitely do not forget the sunscreen.</p><figure><img title="Go for a sight-seeing run" src="IMG/AA1hs5id_go_for_a_sight_seeing_run.jpg" alt="Go for a sight-seeing run"><figcaption><em>Go for a sight-seeing run.

It may not seem like a workout, but a good stretch session can really give your muscles the attention and TLC they need after a long day of travel.</p><h2>Go swimming</h2><p>Swimming is a great low-impact workout that’s so fun it barely feels like a workout. Plus, the water is super refreshing and is a great way to wake up after a day of travel. Check out your hotel, or a nearby fitness center, to see if there is a pool near you.</p><h2>Take the stairs</h2><p>Taking the stairs is another low-impact workout that you can do either inside or outside. Find a set of stairs in your hotel, pop in a podcast, and start to climb! If you’re near a park, playing field, or stadium, you may even have access to outdoor bleachers if you feel like getting in some fresh air and a dose of vitamin D.</p><h2>Try a new studio</h2><p>Another great way to get a workout in while traveling is to check out a new studio. Ask about visitor memberships and see if you can purchase one for the week. If one is not available, see if you can purchase a pack of classes depending on how many times you plan on working out.</p><h2>Use your body weight</h2><p>When traveling, sometimes getting creative means keeping it simple—like by using your own body weight for a workout. Although working out at a gym is nice, who needs a gym when you have your own body? Come up with your own circuit by incorporating basic bodyweight moves like lunges, planks, sit-ups, and squats.</p><h2>Go for a Walk</h2><p>Walking may seem super basic, but it’s super convenient, easy, and a great workout. Whether you walk the airport terminal, the downtown city streets, or even just do some laps in the hotel parking lot, movement is movement and you’ll never regret a walk.</p></main>
