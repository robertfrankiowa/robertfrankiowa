    <main><h1>Is Spicy Food Good for You or Not?</h1><p><p>Answer: It Depends on the Person </p><strong>Medically reviewed by Melissa Nieves, LND</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Melissa Nieves, LND</strong><p>Spicy foods have many health benefits, especially for gut, cardiovascular, and metabolic health. Some spices have antiviral and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Although eating spicy foods can help boost the immune system, the foods will not cure you when you are sick. Eating too much spicy food can also be harmful, especially if you have certain gastrointestinal (GI) conditions.</p><p>This article discusses whether spicy food is good for you, when these foods can trigger symptoms, the beneficial compounds in spicy foods, and how to eat spicy food mindfully.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1p0tmh_a_man_cutting_a_red_pepper.jpg" alt="A man cutting a red pepper"><figcaption><em>MajaMitrovic / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>When Spicy Food Might Be Good for You</h2><p>Research has shown that people who eat spicy foods almost daily have a 14% lower risk of death, including from cancer and heart or respiratory diseases, than those who eat spicy foods less than once a week.</p><p>Spicy food also has antibacterial activity that can benefit gut health. Specifically, spicy foods have been shown to benefit bacteria in the gut microbiome that are related to the risk of:</p><ul><li>Diabetes</li><li>Heart disease</li><li>Liver cirrhosis</li><li>Cancer</li></ul><h3>Capsaicin</h3><p>Capsaicinis a capsaicinoid, a chemical component in peppers that creates their spiciness and heat and has been shown to have numerous health benefits.</p><p>The compound abundant in chili peppers has been shown to have effects such as:</p><ul><li>Antioxidant</li><li>Antitumor</li><li>Cardioprotective (protects the heart)</li><li>Gastroprotective (protects the gut)</li></ul><p>Capsaicin also has antiviral and antibacterial properties, which, along with its beneficial effect on the gut microbiome, might boost the immune system and help the body fight illnesses and diseases.</p><p>Capsaicin may also increase metabolism and promote weight loss. Regular consumption of capsaicin has been found to reduce abdominal fat and decrease appetite, although it isn't fully understood why.</p><p>By breaking up mucus, capsaicin can help relieve cold symptoms like coughing or a sore throat. However, it does not help cure colds. In some cases, capsaicin can increase mucus production and might make your symptoms worse.</p><p>Although many health benefits of capsaicin have been shown, some research suggests that capsaicin is not effective in lowering LDL (bad cholesterol) or total cholesterol, blood glucose, or insulin levels.</p><h3>Turmeric</h3><p>Turmeric's active compound is curcumin, which is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties might protect the body by neutralizing damage from free radicals (unstable atoms that cause cell damage), such as pollution and sunlight.</p><p>Turmeric may help manage metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, and high cholesterol. The spice can also help lessen exercise-induced inflammation and muscle soreness.</p><p>However, curcumin is not well absorbed by the body when consumed. Research has shown that consuming turmeric with piperine, the active compound in black pepper, can increase its bioavailability by 2,000%.</p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>The spice turmeric contains curcumin, a natural compound known for its multiple health benefits and medicinal properties.</p><p> <h2>When Spicy Food Triggers Symptoms</h2><p>Spices, especially capsaicin, are irritants that trigger pain receptors in the body. This can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, vomiting, and tingling lips. Most reactions to spicy food are not allergic reactions, and symptoms usually resolve on their own.</p><p>Although spicy foods have health benefits, they can also be harmful in some cases, particularly to the GI system.</p><p>Studies show that prolonged exposure to high doses of capsaicin can harm the gastrointestinal tract and also worsen pain in those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). One study found that upper gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in people who eat a lot of spicy foods, especially in those who are younger and female.</p><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Although it's widely believed spicy food can cause or worsen ulcers, research has shown that capsaicin lessens the production of stomach acid and might have therapeutic benefits for those with ulcers and other diseases requiring NSAID treatment.</p><p> <p>If you suffer from gastrointestinal conditions or discomfort, you should limit your intake of spicy foods. In addition to gastrointestinal discomfort, high doses of capsaicin can also cause allergic reactions, redness (especially in and around the mouth), and leg cramps.</p><p><p>If you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), dyspepsia, or IBD, you should be careful about eating spicy foods.</p><h2>How to Eat Spicy Food Mindfully</h2><p>When it comes to safely eating spicy foods, consider how much you consume and your personal tolerance levels. Some people can't tolerate spicy foods as well as others because they have less of a specific type of nerve receptor known as TRPV1 that helps regulate body temperature.</p><p>Most symptoms of eating spicy food come from consuming more than your body can handle. You should never eat so much spicy food that you feel sick or have unpleasant symptoms.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Spicy foods are known to have numerous health benefits, particularly in the cases of capsaicin (found in hot peppers) and curcumin (found in the spice turmeric). However, consuming too many spicy foods can also cause unpleasant symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal upset.</p><p>Everyone's tolerance to spiciness is different, and you should never eat more spicy food than your body can tolerate, especially if you have a gastrointestinal condition.</p>
