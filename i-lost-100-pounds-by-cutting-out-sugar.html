    <main><h1>I Lost 100 Pounds by Cutting Out Sugar</h1><p>Weight coach Kristy McCammon (Life Unbinged) lost a whopping 100 pounds—and kept it off—just by giving up sugar. McCammon says she was addicted to sugar, but overcoming her addiction was life-changing. "I can promise you that giving up sugar is NOT as scary as it sounds… It is hard, but it's NOT as hard as being sugar obsessed. That's the hard part. And the gift is freedom – true food freedom. No more moderating. No more mental food chatter. No more white knuckling through cravings. No more excess weight. No more inflammation. No more painful knees and feet. No more dieting," she captioned a video. Here's how she did it.</p><figure><img title="I Lost 100 Pounds by Cutting Out Sugar" src="IMG/AA1nRs92_i_lost_100_pounds_by_cutting_out_sugar.jpg" alt="I Lost 100 Pounds by Cutting Out Sugar"><figcaption><em>I Lost 100 Pounds by Cutting Out Sugar. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 Free From Addiction</h2><p>McCammon says she would stay away from sugar even if there was no more weight loss. "I'm wanting to start a sugar detox beginning May 1st," a follower commented. "I'm so addicted to sugar and I need help! If I lose weight, that's a bonus, but I really want to stop this addiction." McCammon answered, "If I never lost another pound, I would still remain sugar and flour free for the calm and quiet brain."</p><h2>2 She Eats Real Fruit</h2><p>McCammon's sugar ban doesn't extend to natural sugars in fruit or dairy. "We're not as worried about this kind of sugar because these foods have other components in them that slow down how quickly sugar is digested," wellness dietitian Lindsey Wohlford tells MD Anderson Cancer Center. "This prevents that rapid blood sugar spike and drop that can lead to weight gain, insulin resistance and diabetes."</p><figure><img title="2 She Eats Real Fruit" src="IMG/AA1nRvQf_2_she_eats_real_fruit.jpg" alt="2 She Eats Real Fruit"><figcaption><em>2 She Eats Real Fruit. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Type 2 Diabetes</h2><p>McCammon says if someone can eat their way into type 2 diabetes, maybe they can eat their way out of it. "Eating too much sugar is one factor," Obidiugwu (Kenrik) Duru, MD, MS tells UCLA Health. "But ultimately, your diet as a whole, influences the development of diabetes. Just as diabetes can be defined as high blood sugars no matter what makes them high, reversing diabetes can be accomplished by eating less via any method, whether it's personal resolution, medication, or surgery."</p><h2>4 Less Pain</h2><p>McCammon says that since quitting sugar, her feet haven't hurt in the morning. She also says abstinence is easier than moderation. "Consuming too much added sugar can raise blood pressure and increase chronic inflammation, both of which are pathological pathways to heart disease," according to Harvard Health.</p><figure><img title="4 Less Pain" src="IMG/AA1nRtI0_4_less_pain.jpg" alt="4 Less Pain"><figcaption><em>4 Less Pain. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Premature Aging</h2><p>McCammon looks much more fresh-faced without sugar in her diet. "If you put a banana out on the counter and unpeel it, what happens in 24-48 hours? It gets brown," Andrew Nish, MD, tells UnityPoint Health. "What's happening is the sugars in that banana are reacting with proteins, causing cross-linking and the brown color (browning reaction). The exact same reaction is happening in our bodies. We're browning from the inside out."</p><h2>6 Almond Cookies</h2><p>McCammon makes sugar-free versions of her previous treats, such as almond breakfast cookies. Almonds are high in fiber, which helps control blood sugar levels by preventing spikes in blood sugar. Almonds are also lower-carb compared to other nuts.</p><figure><img title="6 Almond Cookies" src="IMG/AA1nm2M2_6_almond_cookies.jpg" alt="6 Almond Cookies"><figcaption><em>6 Almond Cookies. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 No Dieting</h2><p>McCammon doesn't believe in diets. "Start eating today the way you want to eat the rest of your life," she captioned a video. No dieting. "No white-knuckling. No excessive food noise. Just calm, clear, and focused. Pick a sustainable food plan and live it out." And if you enjoyed this article, don't miss these 15 Quick Ways to Lose Body Fat Percentage in a Week.</p></main>
