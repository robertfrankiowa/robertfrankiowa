    <main><h1>5 Signs You May Have Fibromyalgia Like Lady Gaga</h1><p>Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes widespread pain, fatigue, sleep problems, as well as mental and emotional distress. It can significantly affect daily life and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. an estimated 4 million Americans have it, including Lady Gaga –real name Stefani Germanotta, who has been open about her struggles. In 2017, she publicly announced the health issue and shared her experience battling fibromyalgia in her Netflix documentary <i>Gaga: Five Foot 2.</i> The popstar Tweeted, "In our documentary the #chronicillness #chronicpain I deal w/ is #Fibromyalgia I wish to help raise awareness & connect people who have it."</p><p>The internationally recognized singer and actress has been forced to cancel tour dates previously as a result of fibromyalgia and in an interview with Vogue she said, "I get so irritated with people who don't believe fibromyalgia is real. For me, and I think for many others, it's really a cyclone of anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, and panic disorder, all of which sends the nervous system into overdrive, and then you have nerve pain as a result. People need to be more compassionate. Chronic pain is no joke. And it's every day waking up not knowing how you're going to feel."</p><p>According to the National Institute of Arthritis Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, "Fibromyalgia is diagnosed based primarily on having pain all over the body, along with other symptoms. Currently, there are no specific laboratory or imaging tests for fibromyalgia." While fibromyalgia can be debilitating and greatly affect quality of life, it can be managed, experts say. "Fibromyalgia is a very common and treatable illness,"Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, Director of Kona Research Center and bestselling author of From Fatigued to Fantastic! emphasizes. "There is no lack of effective treatment. Just effective physician education. Long COVID is simply one more form of post viral fibromyalgia. And is also very treatable."</p><h2>1 What to Know About Fibromyalgia</h2><figure><img title="1 What to Know About Fibromyalgia" src="IMG/BB1l0eJk_1_what_to_know_about_fibromyalgia.jpg" alt="1 What to Know About Fibromyalgia"><figcaption><em>1 What to Know About Fibromyalgia. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 PTSD and Fibromyalgia</h2><figure><img title="2 PTSD and Fibromyalgia" src="IMG/AA1gnubD_2_ptsd_and_fibromyalgia.jpg" alt="2 PTSD and Fibromyalgia"><figcaption><em>2 PTSD and Fibromyalgia. © Provided by Newsful</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Fibromyalgia can Seriously Affect Daily Life</h2><figure><img title="3 Fibromyalgia can Seriously Affect Daily Life" src="IMG/BB1l0eJq_3_fibromyalgia_can_seriously_affect_daily_life.jpg" alt="3 Fibromyalgia can Seriously Affect Daily Life"><figcaption><em>3 Fibromyalgia can Seriously Affect Daily Life. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 This is Who is at Risk for Fibromyalgia</h2><h2>5 How to Help Provide Some Relief</h2><figure><img title="5 How to Help Provide Some Relief" src="IMG/BB1l0eJt_5_how_to_help_provide_some_relief.jpg" alt="5 How to Help Provide Some Relief"><figcaption><em>5 How to Help Provide Some Relief. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Signs of Fibromyalgia</h2><p>Dr. Teitelbaum states, "If you have persistent fatigue accompanied by widespread pain and insomnia, presume you have fibromyalgia unless proven otherwise. Even if you have other conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis. In many illnesses, especially autoimmune, about 1/3 of people will get a secondary fibromyalgia. Which is often confused as being a flare of the autoimmune illness, resulting in high doses of unhelpful and toxic treatments instead of proper treatment for the fibromyalgia."Dr. Kross says, "Widespread pain that has lasted more than three months, fatigue, and brain fog are the most common signs. Other medical conditions that present along with fibromyalgia include chronic fatigue, IBS, migraines, anxiety and depression."According to Dr. van der Merwe, "The list of symptoms fibromyalgia patients suffer from is incredibly long, but some of the most common symptoms include: widespread musculoskeletal pain, severe fatigue, brain fog, sleep disturbances, headaches and migraines, depression, anxiety, and GI issues. The symptoms can also come and go and can change from one area of the body to another, just depending on the day." </p></main>
