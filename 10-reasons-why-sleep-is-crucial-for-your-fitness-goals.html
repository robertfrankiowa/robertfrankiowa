    <main><h1>10 Reasons Why Sleep Is Crucial For Your Fitness Goals</h1><p>You may think catching those Zs won’t do much regarding your workouts, but think again. Sleep is crucial for your fitness goals. There may be times when you believe you have hit a plateau, and all you may lack is a good night’s rest. Here, we are diving into the top 10 reasons to catch up on sleep and rethink your nighttime routine. </p><h2>Supports Recovery</h2><p>Your muscles need time to heal and repair when doing any amount of strength training. This is what makes them stronger. The best way to recover your muscles? You guessed it. Sleep. This is the most effective way to build the muscle into a stronger version. Rest, hydration, and nutrition also make those sore muscles diminish much faster and get you back to the gym for more!</p><figure><img title="Supports Recovery" src="IMG/BB1jg4t9_supports_recovery.jpg" alt="Supports Recovery"><figcaption><em>Supports Recovery.

They work in harmony to help you become more focused on the task you’re doing. When you lack proper sleep, workouts can feel much harder, your breath more labored, and your muscles uncoordinated, making it a totally unenjoyable experience. </p><p>But if you hit the gym after a great night’s sleep, you will feel extra motivated, get a mood boost, and are ready to tackle those goals.</p><figure><img title="Boosts Performance" src="IMG/BB1jfXP5_boosts_performance.jpg" alt="Boosts Performance"><figcaption><em>Boosts Performance.

Sore muscles are from tiny tears made within the muscle–the body then breaks down the fibers and creates new and strengthened fibers. Your body need the time and conserved energy to focus on this delicate process, of course, just on theme, this happens mostly when you are sleeping. </p><p>Think of it this way: Why do all that hard work at the gym and then deprive your body of the chance to implement your hard work? Go ahead and call it early tonight–your muscles will thank you.</p><h2>Better Diet</h2><p>How can sleep aid in giving you a better diet? We wish it were as simple as that, but there is some truth behind it. When you get the baseline amount of sleep, around 7 to 8 hours, your body is in rhythm, causing you to become more aware and, in turn, crave better nutrition. Studies show us sleep deprivation leads to higher calorie intake. This is because of hormone levels. </p><p>Overnight, certain hormones dip down, and when you don’t get enough sleep, they say low, signaling to your brain you need to eat more to get that energy boost you’re lacking from sleep. This is when most of us turn to a sugary breakfast pastry or extra large sweetened coffee. </p><h2>Immune Boost</h2><p>With so many things buzzing around, you don’t want to be knocked down by a pesky flu or head cold. No one has that kind of time anymore. If you’re a parent, you know how these things can rummage through your home like a hurricane.</p><p>It is a good thing that sticking to a proper sleep schedule along with your fitness goals can give you that extra immune boost to fight off anything you may come in contact with. Or it will give you the boost to help your kiddo through the 5th sickness this school year. </p><figure><img title="Immune Boost" src="IMG/BB1jg1WX_immune_boost.jpg" alt="Immune Boost"><figcaption><em>Immune Boost.

Sleep boosts our cognitive function, which allows us to concentrate and focus. These are two essential things when going to the gym. </p><p>Of course, accidents can happen, but when you’re awake and aware, you can prevent over-exertion and possible injury. </p><h2>Stress Reduction</h2><p>With everything going on in our lives, we are no strangers to the stresses that can sometimes overtake us. A combination of rest and sticking to your fitness goals can improve your mood and help keep stress and anxiety at bay. Sleep reduces the stress hormone cortisol, which can tell your body to hold on to unwanted body fat. This hinders your goals and can cause you to feel mentally exhausted. Once you start getting a regular sleep schedule, you can drastically cut your cortisol levels and be right back on track in no time. </p><h2>Boost Calorie Burning</h2><p>Sleep deprivation causes an overall foggy feel. You may find yourself at the gym but feel like you can barely put in the effort to get yourself going. This is when you know you need to change your nightly routine. </p><p>Just by getting a regular 7 to 8 hours of sleep, you can hit the gym in the morning and feel much more motivated and with increased energy to get up and feel the burn!</p><figure><img title="Boost Calorie Burning" src="IMG/BB1jg1WY_boost_calorie_burning.jpg" alt="Boost Calorie Burning"><figcaption><em>Boost Calorie Burning.

No, it’s not some new fad saying to get you to look into new protein shakes or green juice. When your body isn’t getting the proper rest, it can become insulin resistant, meaning it begins to hold onto extra sugars in the bloodstream because your fat cells aren’t releasing the energy as they should.</p><p>You can turn this around by getting the proper amount of sleep, excellent nutrition, and daily exercise, so you can begin living healthier and happier. </p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>If you finally find yourself heading to bed at 2 am, it’s safe to say that a 7 am workout looks more like a ‘rest day’. And as you know, those fitness goals slowly start to fade away with too many ‘rest days’. </p><p>If you create a realistic sleep schedule and an excellent nighttime routine, you are more likely to stick to your fitness goals, stay motivated to get proper sleep, and hit the gym when you said you would! Trust me–you’ll be so proud you’ve stuck to your word. </p></main>
