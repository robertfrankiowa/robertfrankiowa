    <main><h1>4 Steps to Lose Your PCOS Stomach Fat in 4 Weeks</h1><p>Do you battle polycystic ovarian syndrome and struggle to lose stomach fat? Tallene Hacatoryan is a PCOS Weight Loss registered dietitian and social media influencer who regularly shares content about how to stay in shape if you deal with hormonal issues. In a new viral video, she offers four steps to losing PCOS stomach fat in just one month. "You will lose PCOS belly fat in four weeks by stacking these habits," she says at the start of the clip.</p><h2>1 What Is PCOS?</h2><p>PCOS is a very common hormone problem for women of childbearing age, according to Johns Hopkins. "Women with PCOS may not ovulate, have high levels of androgens, and have many small cysts on the ovaries," they explain. "PCOS can cause missed or irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth, acne, infertility, and weight gain. Women with PCOS may be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and endometrial cancer."</p><figure><img title="1 What Is PCOS?" src="IMG/AA1nE9et_1_what_is_pcos.jpg" alt="1 What Is PCOS?"><figcaption><em>1 What Is PCOS?. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Why Is It Harder to Lose Belly Fat with PCOS?</h2><p>Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance, which makes it harder for them, to lose weight and more likely to accumulate belly fat. "This means the body can't use insulin well. Insulin levels build up in the body and may cause higher androgen levels. Obesity can also increase insulin levels and make PCOS symptoms worse," says Johns Hopkins.</p><h2>3 Step 1: Add Apple Cider Vinegar to Your Routine</h2><p>Her first recommendation is to add apple cider vinegar to your diet. "You can include it in smoothies, salads, or take it as a shot. It's not a magic potion for losing belly fat, but it's a good start for week one," she says.</p><figure><img title="3 Step 1: Add Apple Cider Vinegar to Your Routine" src="IMG/BB1lop97_3_step_1_add_apple_cider_vinegar_to_your_routine.jpg" alt="3 Step 1: Add Apple Cider Vinegar to Your Routine"><figcaption><em>3 Step 1: Add Apple Cider Vinegar to Your Routine. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Here's What Science Says About ACV</h2><p>What does science say about it? There is limited research that apple cider vinegar  may help to reduce high cholesterol and regulate blood glucose levels. However, it may damage the teeth or throat due to the acidity of the mixture, so the best way to take it is by mixing one tablespoon of ACV with water and drinking it through a straw.</p><figure><img title="4 Here's What Science Says About ACV" src="IMG/BB1oV7yF_4_heres_what_science_says_about_acv.jpg" alt="4 Here's What Science Says About ACV"><figcaption><em>4 Here's What Science Says About ACV. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Step 2: Walk at Least 5,000 Steps a Day</h2><p>Her second step to blasting belly fat? Get your steps in. "Start making it a habit to get at least 5,000 steps in a day. If you take a 10-minute walk after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you'll pretty much get there," she says.</p><h2>6 What Science Says About Walking for Weight Loss</h2><p>Walking is a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</p><h2>7 Step 3: Amp Up Protein Intake</h2><p>During the third week, she recommends amping up your protein intake. "Week three, add protein powder to your breakfast smoothie to boost it up to 30 grams of protein," she suggests. "If you're using whey protein. Swap to plant-based protein because whey is made from dairy and that can affect your insulin sensitivity."</p><figure><img title="7 Step 3: Amp Up Protein Intake" src="IMG/BB1oVcLi_7_step_3_amp_up_protein_intake.jpg" alt="7 Step 3: Amp Up Protein Intake"><figcaption><em>7 Step 3: Amp Up Protein Intake. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Here Is What Science Says About Protein</h2><p>Science endorses protein for weight loss. Per clinical trials, consuming more protein than the recommended dietary allowance not only reduces body weight (BW) but also enhances body composition by decreasing fat mass while preserving fat-free mass (FFM) in both low-calorie and standard-calorie diets.</p><h2>9 Step 4: Do Low Intensity Strength Training</h2><p>Her final tip? "In week four, start doing low-intensity strength training," she says. "When you pick up the weights and start doing a slow weighted workout, it'll help improve your metabolism so you burn belly fat even after you're done with your workout to try a slow weighted workout."</p><h2>10 What Science Says About Strength Training</h2><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, strength and weight training help reduce body fat, preserve and increase lean muscle mass, and burn calories more efficiently.
