    <main><h1>The wealthy are dropping up to $10,000 a month on social wellness clubs to relax and reverse age with their peers</h1><p>Stretching from Flatiron to Greenwich Village is a 10-block radius with three pockets of refuge for high-powered urbanites to counteract the toll of NYC’s rat race. They could escape into a red light bed, take a QiGong class, or enjoy a Himalayan salt sauna alongside their peers.</p><p>These are members-only social wellness clubs, varying in thousand-dollar price points and offerings but promising the same thing: a curated, convenient experience integrating health and community with the help of practitioners and luxury amenities. </p><p>“It was designed to be your one-stop shop for wellness,” Kane Sarhan, co-founder and CCO of The WELL, tells <em>Fortune</em>. “New Yorkers have big lives, big jobs. They’re Type A go-getters. But the one thing that's not wellness is New York City sidewalks or subways. It was about making it easy and convenient for someone who wants health and wellness at the center.”</p><figure><img title="Provided by Fortune" src="IMG/BB1oJ4vD_meditation_room_at_the_well_in_new_york_city.jpg" alt="Meditation room at The Well in New York City."><figcaption><em>Meditation room at The Well.

Fueling the shift are millennials, who “have really put their health and wellness at the forefront and have the financial means to participate in these spaces to make this a success.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Health signals wealth</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by Fortune" src="IMG/BB1oJfKi_the_iv_room_at_remedy_place_in_west_hollywood.jpg" alt="The I.V. room at Remedy Place in West Hollywood."><figcaption><em>The I.V. room at Remedy Place in New York.. Provided by Fortune</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first members-only social clubs emerged in 18th-century London for affluent men to socialize and network with like-minded peers; in the 20th century, barriers broke down to allow for women and other minorities. Today’s version looks like a designed experience catering to the young, wealthy, and connected in bright urban cities at high price tags—think Soho House, which emerged in the ‘90s, or the newer Casa Cipriani or Zero Bond.</p><p>Exclusivity has always been part of the appeal, explains Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business in marketing at Columbia University. “The smaller the ‘in’ group and the harder it is to get access, the higher the signaling power of that belongingness,” she tells <em>Fortune</em>. </p><p>The wealthy used to signal this with physical items like a high-end bag or car. But as more consumers could access these goods, counterfeiters became more skilled, and the world fell in love with quiet luxury, they shifted to intangible assets—like health and wellness, which she says aligns with the progressive dematerialization of status symbols. </p><p>They also changed how they spend and signal their time. Laziness used to symbolize wealth because the rich could afford not to work. Now that workaholism signifies status and leisure has become more active, she says, it makes sense that social wellness clubs have emerged. “Going to a club tied to health and wellness speaks to this idea of more active leisure and a more productive type of leisure time,” she says. “You're not working, but you're also doing something productive; you're working on your body or your look or trying to preserve your age forever.” </p><p>But the wellness industry has received backlash for being exclusionary and expensive—two things social clubs can be seen as as well.</p><p>When THE WELL reopened after the pandemic, the founders felt its members-only model wasn’t the right fit for helping people prioritize wellness. So they maintained dedicated programming for members, like unlimited infrared experiences and discounts, while offering a la carte services—which Sarhan says sometimes converts customers into members. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new need for prevention and longevity</strong></h2><p>During his 20-year health and wellness career, Jeff Halevy detected a trifold problem. One: Wellness is a nebulous term that might mean yoga and a smoothie for one person, but a gluten-free diet and meditation for another. “None of these are necessarily wrong, but understanding which actually moves the needle in the right direction, from an outcome-based perspective, does separate the wheat from the chaff,” he says. </p><p>Two: Wellness solutions vary in efficacy and quality. And three: People not only need to understand how to navigate these solutions, but how to assemble them “into a game plan—a fluid mosaic that adapts and evolves with their changing needs.” Wearables like the Oura ring have begun to do this, but he says parsing the info is a different story: “People don’t need data and dashboards—they need direction.” </p><p>That’s where Continuum Club comes in with precision wellness, offering integrated data sets from sleep to exercise in an AI-built personalized wellness regimen for NYC one percenters. The location: A 25,000-square-foot Romanesque Revival building that feels contemporary but warm with earthy tones and brick walls housing “human performance specialists,” hyperbaric chambers, a state-of-the-art gym, and a float tank.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Fortune" src="IMG/BB1oIZL3_the_continuum_club_in_new_york_city.jpg" alt="The Continuum Club in New York City."><figcaption><em>The Continuum Club in New York City..

How social wellness clubs can deliver offerings to members that “inspire confidence in the efficacy and scientific backing” is important, says Anna Pione, one of the report’s authors.</p><p>Remedy Place designed its offerings “out of firsthand clinical evidence,” like blood work tests to create what Leary says is “the instruction manual for your body” and a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to accelerate the body’s biochemical healing process to reverse aging effects.</p><p>After all, we’re in our healthy aging era, obsessed with optimizing our wellness routines and embarking on Bryan Johnson-like quests to age backwards. More than 60% of consumers said it was extremely or very important to purchase longevity products, McKinsey found. It’s no coincidence that this increased interest coincides with the pandemic, which Pione—and everyone else <em>Fortune </em>spoke with—says made us more conscious of our mortality and managing our health.</p><p>“These are things that are all preventative, and there's so much data and technology that's available today to help remedy this,” Bates says.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community </strong><strong><em>is</em></strong><strong> wellness</strong></h2><p>One key to living longer and happier, per a Harvard study: Embracing community, which the pandemic also pushed forth. Building that for the like-minded has fueled the most successful private clubs, Bates says, whereas those that fail built a beautiful space without soul. Wellness has often driven individuals to them, he adds.</p><p>“This desire for community is quite interlinked with wellness, so it makes sense that an offering bringing both wellness and community would resonate,” Pione says. It’s exactly why Halevy says he created Continuum as a social club. But he’s keeping it small as part of the club’s commitment to maintaining a personalized and intimate experience; accepting 100 members and expanding to 250 next year with no plans to exceed that limit.</p><p>Leary is deliberately trying to change the narrative around how we socialize with what he calls ‘‘social substitutions” replacing typical social settings with self-care experiences. “This can be anything from a new way to have a date, an alternative for happy hour, where you have a meeting, etc,” he says, adding that members crave meaningful experiences and connections that prioritize holistic well-being over traditional indulgences like alcohol and food. </p><p>There’s also the convenience factor. Halevy says Continuum Club removes “the time and energy burden” for those juggling work, family, and social commitments. This feels especially palpable in big cities like New York, which Sarhan says “chews you up and spits you out.” People are often running around from one place to another, taking a yoga class here and seeing an acupuncturist there, he explains.</p><p>They need to get more done in less time, he adds. “Time is our most precious commodity.”</p></main>
