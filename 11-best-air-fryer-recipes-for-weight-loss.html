    <main><h1>11 Best Air Fryer Recipes for Weight Loss</h1><p>If you're looking for new ways to spruce up weight-loss-friendly meals at home, look no further than your handy-dandy air fryer. The air fryer hype is real, as this amazing kitchen appliance makes mealtime tastier, seamless, and much more fun. <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> rounded up some of our best air fryer recipes for weight loss to add to your weekly meal rotation. We also spoke with <strong>Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN</strong>—the founder and director of Real Nutrition, a New York City-based private practice dedicated to healthfully and successfully guiding clients to their optimal nutrition, weight, and overall wellness, who shares the top benefits of using an air fryer when you're trying to lose weight.</p><p>"Air fryer recipes/foods require less oil for cooking compared to sautéing, pan frying, or deep frying, which helps control caloric intakes from fat," Shapiro explains. "The way that air fryer processes your ingredients also helps retain the beneficial nutrients originally present in the foods. Additionally, these recipes are typically easy, time-saving, and delicious, which means you are more likely to prepare your own meals and get to control the quality of your ingredients and portion sizes."</p><p>When you're cooking for weight loss, Shapiro stresses to keep these air fryer tips in mind:</p><p><ul><p>  <li>No matter what method of cooking you opt for, Shapiro says ingredients "are the foundation of your dish." Selecting ingredients that offer plenty of nutrients rather than calories is key if you're looking to shed weight. When it comes to proteins, be sure to choose seafood, low-fat high-quality meats, or vegan-friendly/vegetarian soy products. Plant-based ingredients that contain a high amount of fiber will leave you feeling fuller for longer.</li><p>  <li>Be mindful of the amount and type of oil you use to prep food before it enters the air fryer, as it will "impact the nutritional profile of the finished dish," Shapiro says. She suggests using plant-based oils rather than animal fat. This could be avocado oil, flaxseed oil, or sesame oil.</li><p>  <li>Lastly, condiments can be a sneaky source of extra, unwanted calories. Many condiments you find on grocery store shelves are packed with added sugar, artificial additives, and sodium, Shapiro tells us. She suggests flavoring air fryer meals with spices and herbs to limit excess calories and unnecessary sodium intake. Plus, many spices and herbs offer antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that can be beneficial for those who are looking to lose weight.</li></ul><p>Now, without delay, let's get into some of our best air fryer recipes for weight loss.</p><h2>1.
