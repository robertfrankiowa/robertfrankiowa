    <main><h1>1000-Lb Sisters: Misty & Amanda Are Unrecognizable Since Weight Loss Surgery (They Were Seen Filming Season 6)</h1><ul>          <li>                    Misty and Amanda have made significant strides in their weight-loss journey after undergoing bariatric surgery.            </li>          <li>                    Amy, on the other hand, seems to be living with mental health issues, and hasn't made much progress since the show's finale.            </li>          <li>                    1000-lb Sisters season 6 is expected to bring new dynamics. All the siblings are returning, and possibly featuring their single statuses.            </li>      </ul><p>          <em><strong>1000-lb Sisters</strong> </em>stars Misty Wentworth and Amanda Halterman were photographed in public recently, and the two women have never looked slimmer. The series, which premiered in 2020, introduced audiences to the Slaton siblings. The show centers around the extraordinary weight-loss journeys of 36-year-old Amy Slaton and Tammy Slaton, but their three siblings have also lost a considerable amount of weight over the years. <strong>Like their famous sisters, 44-year-old Chris Combs, 43-year-old Amanda Halterman, and 48-year-old Misty Wentworth have had bariatric surgery over the course of the series' run.</strong>   </p><p>          Misty and Amanda are not just sisters - they're best friends who spend a lot of time together. It wasn't a surprise when they decided to have surgery on the same day with the same doctor, in March 2023. The surgery isn't without risks, but the <em>1000-lb Sisters </em>season 5 stars made it through the procedures with flying colors. Since then, the pounds have just been melting away. Recently photographed while out and about, Misty and Amanda are so much slimmer that they're almost unrecognizable.   </p><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1kx1pb_jasmine_alan_cumming.jpg" alt="jasmine alan cumming"><figcaption><em>jasmine alan cumming.

With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.</p><h2>            Misty, Amanda & Amy Were Seen Out & About While Filming        </h2><h3>      They Posed For A Photo At A Coffee Shop  </h3><p>          In June, Reddit account <em>u/tacobellini</em> posted a photo of Amy, Amanda, and Misty pausing for a photo at a local coffee shop while filming <em>1000-lb Sisters </em>season 6. The caption reads, "<em>A local coffee shop posted a picture of Amy, Amanda, and Misty. According to the coffee shop, they stopped in while filming at a different location. I do wonder where Tammy is</em>..." Though it's possible that Tammy took the photograph, it seems more likely that she simply wasn't there.   </p><p>          The Reddit post has 2.7K likes.  </p><p>          The most striking thing about the photo is <strong>how much thinner Amanda and Misty look</strong>. Amanda stood tall and slim in the center, flanked by her sisters, and wearing athletic wear and strappy sandals. On her left, Misty looks even slimmer, rocking her black t-shirt and shorts, with her once long hair lopped off into a shoulder-length bob. Misty's shirt reads, <em>"I don't have a bad attitude, I have a personality you can't handle."</em> This could be the Slaton family motto.   </p><h2>            Misty & Amanda's Weight Loss Journeys        </h2><h3>      They Both Changed Their Lives  </h3><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1oP2yV_1000_lb_sisters_amanda_halterman_misty_wentworth_on_a_boat.jpg" alt="1000-lb sisters amanda halterman & misty wentworth on a boat"><figcaption><em>1000-lb sisters amanda halterman & misty wentworth on a boat. Provided by ScreenRant</em></figcaption></figure><p>          Misty had surgery in March 2023, and <em>Dr. Eric Smith</em> posted a clip of Misty going in for surgery at Instagram. The caption reads, in part, "<em>Did you know that bariatric surgery can cause remission of type 2 diabetes in patients?</em>" In the footage, Misty's brother, Chris, is there with Misty in the hospital until she's wheeled into the procedure room. Before losing weight, Misty was taking multiple diabetes medications to keep her blood sugar in a healthy range. Since Misty had bariatric surgery, <strong>she lost enough weight to stop needing the medication</strong>.   </p><p>          Being healthy enough to regulate her blood sugar levels without medicine is a huge life-changing milestone that Misty deserves to be proud of.  </p><p>          Unlike her other siblings, Amanda never struggled with her weight growing up. She was always the thin one. Everything changed after she had children. Amanda reportedly already had bariatric surgery for the first time in 2014, long before appearing on <em>1000-lb Sisters</em>. Amanda lost over 300 pounds after the surgery but found herself wanting to lose even more weight. In March 2024, <em>Amanda</em> posted a TikTok announcing it was the first anniversary of her surgery, or "<em>surgeversary</em>." She looked dramatically thinner than when she first appeared on the show.   </p><h2>            What's Going On With Amy Slaton?        </h2><h3>      She's Struggling  </h3><p>          Amy was also in the photo, but, unlike Amanda and Misty, Amy doesn't seem to have lost any more weight since the <em>1000-lb Sisters</em> season 5 finale. After going through an emotional divorce from Michael Halterman, Amy's struggled with her mental health. She is currently a single mother raising her two sons, Gage and Glenn Halterman. She got professional help and was diagnosed with <strong>acute stress disorder, depression and bipolar disorder</strong>. Amanda has publicly stated that she is prioritizing her mental health over losing weight right now, and that sounds like a smart strategy.   </p><h2>            What We Know About 1000-Lb Sisters Season 6        </h2><h3>      Film Crew Sightings  </h3><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1oOXuu_1000_lb_sisters_a_montage_of_amy_and_tammy_smiling_at_each_other.jpg" alt="1000-Lb Sisters a montage of Amy and Tammy smiling at each other"><figcaption><em>1000-Lb Sisters a montage of Amy and Tammy smiling at each other. Provided by ScreenRant</em></figcaption></figure><p>          Though <em>1000-lb Sisters</em> season 6 has yet to be confirmed by TLC, there have been multiple sightings of a film crew following the Slatons around. In addition to the aforementioned coffee shop sighting, in April, Reddit user <em>u/hereforthelols1999</em> posted photos of the Slatons in the United Kingdom. The user posted one photo that was obviously of Tammy and another that was clearly Amy. According to the original poster, <strong>the Slaton sisters were seen in central London and spotted walking around with a film crew</strong>.   </p><p>          Though it's unclear whether the Slatons were filming <em>1000-lb Sisters</em> season 6, that's certainly the most likely option.  </p><p>          All the Slaton siblings are expected to be back for <em>1000-lb Sisters</em> season 6, and this season is expected to have a decidedly different spirit. The season will mark the first time that <strong>Amy and Tammy will both be single women at the same time</strong>, which could change the entire show. Amanda was recently unceremoniously dumped by her ex-boyfriend, RJ, so she'll be looking for love alongside her sisters. It's unclear when the new season can be expected, but judging from past premieres, winter 2024 is most likely.   </p><p>          <strong><em>1000-Lb Sisters</em> </strong>seasons 1-5 can be streamed on MAX and Discovery Plus.   </p><table>            <tr>        <td>    <p>          Tammy Slaton  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          37 years old  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Lost 440 pounds  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Diet, exercise, weight-loss surgery  </p>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>    <p>          Amy Slaton  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          36 years old  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Lost 125 pounds  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Diet, exercise, weight-loss surgery  </p>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>    <p>          Chris Combs  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          44 years old  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Lost 150 pounds  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Diet, exercise, weight-loss surgery  </p>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>    <p>          Amanda Halterman  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          43 years old  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Lost 300+ pounds  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Had weight-loss surgery (twice)  </p>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>        <td>    <p>          Misty Slaton Wentworth  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          48 years old  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Unknown  </p>  </td>        <td>    <p>          Had weight-loss surgery  </p>  </td>  </tr>      </table><p>          Sources: <em>u/tacobellini/Reddit, Dr. Eric Smith/Instagram, Amanda Halterman/TikTok, u/hereforthelols1999/Reddit</em>   </p><figure><img title="Provided by ScreenRant" src="IMG/BB1hXVmX_1000lb_sisters_tv_poster.jpg" alt="1000LB sisters TV Poster"><figcaption><em>1000LB sisters TV Poster.
