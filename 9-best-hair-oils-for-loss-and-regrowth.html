    <main><h1>9 Best Hair Oils for Loss and Regrowth</h1><p class="p1"><i>Branded content.

Hoping to accelerate the process and have a new, full head of hair as soon as possible? Try one of these best hair oils for loss and regrowth.</p><h2>What Causes Hair Loss?</h2><p>There are a few main culprits behind hair loss:</p><ul>   <li>Hormonal Changes. When your hormones change, it can cause all kinds of side effects, including hair loss. Hair loss from hormonal changes is most common in women during pregnancy and menopause. Thyroid problems that affect your hormones can also trigger hair fall, and men may experience balding from excess DHT activity, which shrinks hair follicles.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Aging. As you advance in years, your hair's life cycle becomes shorter, leading to some hair falling out. Your hair may also appear thinner and finer as you get older, due to this same process.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Genetics. You may have heard that you inherit your hair from your mother's side of the family, and while that's not totally true, there is genetics at play here. Hair loss genes are recessive, so you'll need it from both sides in order to experience androgenic alopecia, a hereditary condition.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Medical Conditions. We've already mentioned thyroid conditions as a cause for hair loss, but there are other health problems that can contribute, too. Some medications have hair loss as a side effect, inflammatory disorders and chronic conditions like lupus can impact your hair, radiation therapy for cancer may be the main factor, or you may have alopecia areata, an immune system disorder that results in balding.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Stress. Very stressful, traumatic events can throw your body out of whack, and lead to hair loss several months later. If your hair loss seemed to start all of a sudden, think back to what happened in your life a few months ago…</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Styling. If you're someone who regularly uses high heat on your hair, puts it through a lot of different treatments, or styles it in tight hairstyles that pull, you could be inadvertently causing hair loss.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Micronutrient Deficiencies. If your body is not getting enough of certain vitamins and minerals, you may start shedding hair. A doctor can order a blood test to see what vitamins and minerals you may be low on, and may then suggest you take a supplement to get your levels back to normal.</li>  </ul><h2>What Can Be Done for Hair Loss?</h2><p>First and foremost, you should make an appointment with your dermatologist when you start experiencing regular hair loss. They can examine your hair and run all the appropriate tests to determine the reason for your hair loss and the best course of action. Some hair loss conditions need to be caught early on to be stopped, so don't wait on this!</p><p>If your hair loss is the result of a medical condition or nutrient deficiency, treating the underlying cause will be your best bet. With hormonal changes as a result of pregnancy or menopause, sometimes just waiting for your body to naturally regulate is your best option, and then you can help encourage regrowth. Treating your hair well is super important, which means not styling it in ways that may be harmful, and making sure that your shampoo conditioner, and other hair products are properly nourishing and moisturizing.</p><p>There are all kinds of hair regrowth treatments out there, from lasers to hair transplants, supplements, and specially formatted hair care products. Don't underestimate the power of a top-notch hair oil to get your growth back on track!</p><h2>How Can Hair Oil Help With Regrowth?</h2><p>Hair oils are particularly efficient at delivering nutrients directly to the scalp and hair. Because of this, they can help stimulate growth while also taking excellent care of your hair to avoid breakage and promote strength.</p><p>If scalp issues are behind your hair loss, a hair oil that is applied to the scalp can help expedite the healing process and get your scalp back into top shape to support hair growth. Since scalp oils are generally made up of natural oils that are rich in fatty acids, they will keep your scalp nice and hydrated. Some may contain scalp-stimulating ingredients like caffeine or peppermint to get the circulation going and contribute to the hair growth process.</p><p>Hair oils are best for those with damaged or unhealthy hair, as they usually contain all kinds of goodies that encourage hair to be its best. Vitamins and minerals nourish each strand, moisturizers coat hair to keep it moisturized and resilient, and some hair oils are designed to counteract different types of hair damage. Hair oil is just another tool to have in your tool kit in the fight against hair loss!</p><h2>What to Look for in a Hair Oil for Regrowth</h2><p>Here are some of the best ingredients to look for in a hair growth oil:</p><ul>   <li>Jojoba Oil. Jojoba oil is pretty much a hair wonder, with numerous benefits to impart to your tresses. It's a natural emollient, which will lock moisture into your scalp and hair, treating common scalp conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Plus, some studies have shown that (in combination with some of the other oils on this list) it boosts hair growth, so go ahead and douse your hair and scalp in jojoba!</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Castor Oil. This natural oil is loaded with fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamin E, which are great for scalp and hair, and has antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. All of this, plus the fact that it gets your scalp circulation going, makes castor oil a wonderful hair growth oil choice.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Saw Palmetto. To maintain a healthy head of hair, you'll need the fatty acids that saw palmetto provides. Where it also shines, though, is in helping hormone-triggered hair loss thanks to its ability to block DHT.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Rosemary. Some fungi and bacteria can get in the way of healthy hair growth, but rosemary oil takes care of those obstacles. Studies have compared the effects of rosemary with those of minoxidil (Rogaine), showing that it's just as effective. That's a win for natural ingredients!</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Lavender. Lavender isn't just an inflammation buster and amazing fragrance, but also a hair growth champion! It has been shown to promote hair growth and thicker hair as well, so look for lavender oil to combat alopecia.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Thyme. This natural oil has been shown to combat alopecia areata, thanks to its ability to stimulate the scalp. It also prevents hair loss, so is a great tool to use for general maintenance even once your hair has come back.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Cedarwood. Enhancing blood flow in the scalp gives your hair follicles the energy and attention they need to get back to work. That's why cedarwood is a great choice-it promotes scalp circulation for stronger, thicker hair.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Tea Tree. Scalp inflammation can cause hair loss, and tea tree takes care of that in no time. It also fights fungi, dandruff, and harmful microbes trying to get in the way of your healthy head of hair.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Coconut Oil. This oil is particularly efficient at penetrating each strand and coating it in a nice protective layer of moisture, working to fend off damage from heavy duty styling. It also seeps into your scalp, removing bad bacteria and increasing the good bacteria that help your scalp thrive.</li>  </ul><h2>What to Avoid in a Hair Oil for Regrowth</h2><p>While you're closely examining those hair oil labels, you might as well keep an eye out for these harmful ingredients, which can actually exacerbate hair loss:</p><ul>   <li>Sulfates. While sulfates are more common in products like shampoos and conditioners to help them form a foam, they're worth mentioning here because they can do so much damage. That's because they strip essential moisture from the hair, leaving it weak and prone to loss and breakage.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Silicones. These are often included in moisturizing formulas, especially for those with curls, as they lock in moisture. While they do provide some benefits, with time they also weaken hair, so stay far away from silicones if hair loss is your top concern.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Diethanolamine. This ingredient attacks keratin, your hair's natural protein. This can leave hair weak and lead to thinning, so avoid it!</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a popular preservative, but it has been linked to hair loss and can cause some serious health problems when included in big concentrations. It's best to keep this one off the ingredient list of the products you use.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Alcohol. Not all alcohols are harmful to hair, but there are some that can dry out your strands and even damage your follicles. Propanol and isopropanol are the worst offenders.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Artificial Fragrances. We love a good smelling hair oil, but at what cost? Synthetic fragrances are just chock full of harsh chemicals that can damage your hair. Luckily, there are plenty of naturally scented products that give you the best of both worlds, so opt for those over ones laden with perfume.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Artificial Colors. Synthetic dyes make your hair products look nice, but do a number on your hair. Stick to clean products with natural colors to keep hair happy and healthy.</li>  </ul><h2>How Long Does a Hair Oil Take to Grow Hair?</h2><p>In order for hair growth oil to do its thing, you should apply it 1-2 times a week and leave it on for a couple of hours (unless it says it can be left on for longer). Typically you'll have to be patient and wait about three months to start seeing results in the hair growth department, but hair loss may slow sooner than that. For some, it may be faster and for some slower-anywhere between 2-6 months is normal. So keep diligently applying your hair oil until you can reap its rewards!</p><h3>1. Blu Atlas Hair Oil</h3><p>This Blu Atlas Hair Oil gives your scalp and hair all it needs to recover from loss and make an astounding comeback. Made with 100% ingredients from natural origins, this oil is a cut above the rest. In addition to quelling hair fallout and encouraging growth, it will also give you smoother, fuller, and shinier hair.</p><p>One key to this oil's regrowth capability is saw palmetto oil, an ingredient that effectively stops DHT from causing hair loss. To combat damage from UV rays, the product turns to sweet almond oil, which also alleviates scalp irritation and strengthens each hair. Castor oil is included for its fatty acids and almost magical ability to regrow hair, geranium oil counters aging in the scalp, rosemary stimulates growth just as well as Rogaine, and pumpkin seed oil delivers intensive moisture.
