    <main><h1>10 Ways to Create a Wellness Yard</h1><h2>Meditation Garden</h2><p>Creating a backyard meditation garden is one of the best ways to find peace and tranquility at home. Healing gardens have been shown to make people feel more relaxed and refreshed.</p><p>These gardens feature components to activate the senses like vivid colors, soothing sounds, interesting shapes and textures, comfortable places to sit or lie down, and lovely aromas.</p><p>The most common elements include plants, trees, and shrubs; colorful aromatic flowers; shade from a canopy, umbrella or pergola; seating, like a meditation bench or hammock; stones, pebbles and sand; pavers; and statues or sculptures of animals, Buddha images or small pagodas.</p><p>There are many types of gardens to draw inspiration from: Japanese Zen, Chinese, Southwestern United States, Traditional English and Middle Eastern are just a few. Look for examples and visit your local garden center to pick out materials, or contact a landscaper for guidance.</p><figure><img title="Meditation Garden" src="IMG/AA1dK5Iv_meditation_garden.jpg" alt="Meditation Garden"><figcaption><em>Meditation Garden. july7th/Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Labyrinth</h2><p>Mindful walking is a soothing practice that helps us focus on the present by tuning in to our body's sensations. Cultures around the world have been using labyrinths to ease stress for more than 4,000 years.</p><p>These circular or spiral structures have a single path that leads in and out of the center. Unlike a maze, there are no tricks to a labyrinth and no dead ends.</p><p>There are hundreds of labyrinth designs and many ways to build them, according to Lisa Gidlow Moriarty, a labyrinth designer at Paths of Peace. "An outdoor labyrinth can be as simple as mowing a design into the lawn or placing stones on the ground," she says. "It can be as complex as creating a design on concrete or with pavers."</p><p>The size of the yard and budget will determine what's possible. "The most important consideration is to measure the area," Moriarty says. "A labyrinth can be as small as 10 to 12 feet, and ideally is in a location that allows some privacy."</p><h2>Water Feature</h2><p>Water provides a sense of peace and serenity. Sharon Sherman, founder and principal of Thyme & Place Design and a professional interior designer and reiki master, says "the sound of softly flowing water helps focus and relax the mind, reducing stress and anxiety." It also counters traffic noise and other distracting noises.</p><p>Some ideas for incorporating water into your garden include ponds, water bowls, fountains, garden waterfalls, birdbaths, and water walls. Sherman suggests electric fountains. There are even solar-powered ones available so you don't need to install electricity out back.</p><figure><img title="Water Feature" src="IMG/AA1dK5IQ_water_feature.jpg" alt="Water Feature"><figcaption><em>Water Feature.

Silence clears the mind and brings us back to the present moment to reduce stress. It also heightens our senses as we connect with the healing power of nature.</p><p>Setting up a sit spot in your yard might work perfectly for you. A sit spot is a favorite place in nature to visit regularly to cultivate an awareness of your surroundings as you observe plants, birds, trees, animals and other natural elements. Once in your sit spot, you can relax by meditating, deep breathing, listening to nature sounds or creating nature art.</p><p>Adding a sit spot to your backyard oasis is easy, and there are plenty of options depending on your budget and taste. Look for an attractive bench, comfy chair, hammock, meditation cushion or daybed.</p><figure><img title="Sit Spot" src="IMG/AA1dK5IW_sit_spot.jpg" alt="Sit Spot"><figcaption><em>Sit Spot.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, hot tubs boost physical and mental health by relieving stress, easing muscle aches, improving heart health, lowering blood pressure and improving sleep.</p><p>And they're as popular as ever. Yardzen's report on 2023 backyard trends notes a 34% increase in requests for hot tubs.</p><p>Bryan Clayton, CEO and co-founder of GreenPal, equates having an outdoor hot tub to creating your own personal spa at home. "The benefits are extensive, and it's a little luxury that can make a big difference to your wellness routine," he says.

Imagine if you could enjoy this effective relaxation tool whenever you want without leaving your property.</p><p>Getting a massage table for your yard is a wonderful way to boost your wellness factor.</p><p>"Setting up a massage area in your own backyard can create a peaceful massage experience," said CG Funk, a certified massage therapist and chief therapeutic experience officer at Massage Heights. "Being outdoors in nature boosts physical and mental health in many ways, and receiving a massage while enjoying the outdoors increases these relaxing benefits."</p><p>Massage tables are readily available online at various prices. Massage Traveler in Seattle, Washington recommends setting it up on a level surface on a patio or deck, in a garden or next to the pool.</p><p>Make sure the space is at least 10-ft. by 10-ft. so there's enough room for the massage therapist to move around the table. A private, shady spot works best to minimize distractions and avoid the direct sun.</p><p>For days with inclement weather, consider a massage chair.</p><figure><img title="Massage Table" src="IMG/AA1dK5J2_massage_table.jpg" alt="Massage Table"><figcaption><em>Massage Table. imagedepotpro/Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Plunge Pool</h2><p>Plunge pools are popular with celebrities and wellness influencers who tout their benefits. Ranging from eight to 12 feet wide, these pools take up less space and are more affordable and easier to maintain than typical swimming pools.</p><p>Cold plunge pools are often used for therapeutic purposes when people soak in water between 45 and 55 degrees. According to the Wim Hof Method, research shows cold exposure boosts metabolism and the immune system; minimizes inflammation, sore muscles and swelling; improves sleep; and reduces stress and anxiety.</p><p>According to Messner, "we saw a 15% increase year-over-year in requests for plunge pools." They can easily be installed in backyards, even those with minimal space.</p><h2>Sauna</h2><p>For thousands of years, saunas have been used for therapeutic purposes like relaxation, relieving sore muscles, fighting illness and improving cardiovascular health.</p><p>Clayton notes outdoor saunas, also called garden saunas, are in high demand these days. "I've seen an increasing trend of homeowners incorporating saunas into their outdoor spaces," Clayton says. "There's something quite soothing about the heat and the quiet space a sauna provides."</p><p>Saunas come in various sizes and designs. Finnish saunas feature a wood-burning stove to create heat. Dry saunas have an electric or propane-heater and wooden walls. Infrared saunas, as the name suggests, heat the space with infrared light. Consider building the sauna next to a plunge pool or hot tub so you can alternate between therapies.</p><h2>Sound Bath</h2><p>Certain sounds are known to be especially calming. A sound bath is a type of meditation that "bathes" participants in sound waves from singing bowls, chimes and gongs. People pay top dollar to visit spas and retreat centers offering sound baths, but you can create a similar experience in your backyard.</p><p>Sherman has noticed how sound baths are gaining popularity. "There is something soothing about the melodic tones," she says. "You don't need a large space for this. Feel the sun and the breeze, and hear the sounds around you. All of this allows us to take a moment and just be."</p><p>Create your own sound bath zone by setting up wind chimes, a gong, tuning forks and singing bowls under a covered area in your backyard. Yardzen's 2023 report notes a 13% increase in requests for wind chimes by homeowners.</p></main>
