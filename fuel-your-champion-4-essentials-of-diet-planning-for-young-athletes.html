Full disclosure can be viewed <strong>here</strong>. </em></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><em><strong>The content in this article is for informational purposes only. It is recommended to consult with a physician or dietician before making changes in your child’s diet. </strong></em></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Balanced Macronutrients</h2><p>The foundation of any athlete’s diet is a balance of macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy and are essential for fueling performance. You’ll want to prioritize complex carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains as these carbs provide sustained energy throughout the day. <strong>Proteins are an absolute must</strong> for muscle repair and growth, so be sure to include lean sources such as poultry, fish, dairy, and plant-based proteins like beans and legumes. Fats are also important for overall health and should come from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adequate Hydration</h2><p>Proper hydration is key for young athletes to maintain performance and prevent dehydration. Encourage your child to drink water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after physical activity. Sports drinks can be beneficial during intense exercise to replace electrolytes lost through sweat, but be mindful of added sugars. A good rule of thumb is for your child to drink half their body weight in ounces of water each day. For example, if your child weighs 80 pounds, they should aim to drink 40 ounces of water daily.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Major League Mommy" src="IMG/BB1l7s5P_pin_on_pinterestnutrition_for_young_athletes.jpg" alt="pin on pinterest_nutrition for young athletes"><figcaption><em>pin on pinterest_nutrition for young athletes.

Encourage your child to eat a balanced meal or snack containing carbohydrates and <strong>proteins </strong>2-3 hours before exercise to ensure they have enough energy for their workout. After exercise, refuel with a combination of carbohydrates and proteins to promote muscle recovery. A sports nutritionist can help you create a meal schedule and portion sizes that work for your child’s training schedule and goals.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nutrient-Rich Foods</h2><p>Focus on including <strong>nutrient-rich foods</strong> in your child’s diet to support their overall health and well-being. Encourage your child to eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to provide <strong>essential vitamins</strong>, minerals, and antioxidants. Include sources of calcium like dairy products, fortified plant-based milks, or leafy greens for bone health. </p><p>Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts can support brain function and reduce inflammation. And don’t forget about the power of natural sources of carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and quinoa for sustained energy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2><p>As a parent of a young athlete, ensuring your child is properly fueled is very important for their growth, development, and performance. By implementing the 4 essentials of diet planning for young athletes outlined here, you can support your child in reaching their athletic goals while promoting their overall health and well-being. </p><p>Remember that every child is unique, so it’s important to tailor their diet plan to their individual needs and preferences. Fuel your champion for success with the right nutrition and watch them thrive on and off the field!</p></main>
