    <main><h1>The 32 Best Spas Worldwide to Add to Your Bucket List</h1><p><em>Welcome to ELLE’s best spas of 2024. This is our inaugural guide to the best spas in the world, with each spa destination carefully selected, tested, and awarded by an ELLE editor. Each spa was reviewed based on our criterion, which included the uniqueness of the spa’s treatments, atmosphere, integration of local offerings, practitioner experience, level of personalization, hygiene, and overall level of attentiveness while in the spa’s care. </em> </p><p>With more than 181,000 spas worldwide, selecting the best spot for a little rest and relaxation can be daunting. Here, ELLE editors did the leg work, scouring the globe for the best spas worldwide, finding places where the spa becomes the main event. Keep reading for the 32 best spas and services, according to ELLE editors.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Bothy at Heckfield Place</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Heckfield, UK </h3><p>Heckfield Place is the equivalent of having a luxurious countryside home without worrying about the maintenance. The Bothy is its clean, minimalist spa that takes advantage of the English countryside for your view and backyard. Located an hour outside of London, the Bothy, which opened in 2023, is a retreat where reconnecting with nature helps you reconnect with yourself. The spa features an indoor pool with a sauna and steam room, an outdoor jacuzzi, and a fun cold plunge bucket to entice the senses. The Bothy is an all-day kind of experience, where you can snack on a fresh fruit salad straight from the farm—or a delightful veggie-focused dish with in-season produce to help recharge. Reka Seres-Erdei, director of spa at The Bothy, reveals her approach is “a natural way to bring guests back to themselves.”<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director </em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Wildsmith Time</h3><p>At The Bothy, the best time is Wildsmith Time. Eponymously named after their skin care line, Wildsmith Time is a 135-minute treatment inspired by the circadian rhythms of nature. “They personalize the essential oils based on the time of the day you are receiving a treatment and use the blend during your rhythmic, therapeutic massage. Post treatment, I felt incredibly relaxed and grounded. The treatment included craniosacral holds that released so much pressure and immediately de-stressed me. The following day I felt energized and reconnected to myself. You must get this treatment,” James says. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Kohler Waters Spa</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Kohler, Wisconsin, USA</h3><p> </p><p>If you want a spa experience with a side of American history, look no further than Kohler Waters Spa in Kohler, Wisconsin. Just one hour north of Milwaukee, this unexpected destination is the only Five Diamond resort in the Midwest. The Kohler family might be known for their plumbing and appliances, like sinks and toilets, but you’ll remember them for their wellness. This spa is focused on hydrotherapy, with treatments featuring one-of-a-kind baths for their exclusive spa treatments. I had the Fire and Ice, which featured the custom Vichy shower, a long apparatus with six shower heads on it. During my treatment, 112-degree water (my selection) rained down on me for almost an hour, while cold water was occasionally splashed on me to wake up my senses. It was unlike any hydrotherapy treatment I’ve had and such a seamless experience. The American Club, now one of three hotels on the Kohler Destinations property, once housed immigrants who came to work at the Kohler factory. The spa was recently renovated and re-opened in October of last year. Come in the winter for Frozen Fairways: a winter wonderland of sledding, specialty hot chocolate (featuring Kohler chocolate), and most importantly, an après-ski experience in the spa. Winter is the busy season, but visit in the summer months for a less crowded experience. The property is full of golfers coming to enjoy its PGA-quality ranges, but they’re sweating on the green instead of in a sauna.<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: River Bath </h3><p>“I loved this spa’s expansive co-ed areas, making it great for groups of friends, bachelorette parties, and couples. This is reflected in their treatments as well. Opt for the River Bath for two, a special treatment that awakens your senses, together. It begins with an exfoliation, followed by a 20-minute soak in their river bath. The river bath features several jet streams that mimic the currents of a river and is based on CEO David Kohler’s travels. No, you can’t purchase it, but once you try this treatment, you’ll already be thinking of your next trip back to experience it again. Maybe an anniversary treat?” James says. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">The Spa at The Ocean Club, A Four Seasons Resort</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Nassau, Bahamas</h3><p>Tucked inside one of the more secluded, luxurious, and (blissfully) quiet resorts on tourist-heavy Paradise Island, The Four Seasons Ocean Club’s spa makes use of indoor-outdoor treatment rooms and Balinese-inspired spa villas to soak in every ray of Bahamas sunshine and breath of fresh salt air. The services offered are both wide-ranging and carefully crafted, and after you’ve had any knots worked out of your shoulders, you can spend the rest of the afternoon perusing the stunning Ocean Club pools and gardens.<em>—Lauren Puckett-Pope, culture writer</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Indulge Ocean Ritual </h3><p>“A multi-treatment extravaganza that moves from head to toe, the Indulge package compiles a hair and scalp treatment; paraffin foot treatment; full-body massage; and facial for the ultimate decadence during your island getaway,” Puckett-Pope says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">La Mamounia Spa</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Marrakesh, Morocco</h3><p>If you truly want to be treated like royalty, visit La Mamounia Spa in Marrakech. The property is vast, allowing for long, lazy days having breakfast, then laying by the pool and enjoying the spa’s hammam, a public bathing space for guests to soak and chill. Hidden below La Mamounia hotel, winding stairs will lead you to a self-care oasis. With multiple pools, treatment rooms, and areas to lounge, the intricately designed space is designed to encourage relaxation. After your treatment, lounge in the outdoor jacuzzi or sit poolside in a cabana.<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Hammam Royal </h3><p>“If you want a full on Arabic Hammam experience, book this treatment. First, you’ll be showered and scrubbed down with the best local and natural ingredients. A eucalyptus and neroli exfoliating rub will renew your skin before you receive a custom deep tissue massage,” James says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">The Spa at Casa de Campo</h2><h3 class="body-h3">La Romana, Dominican Republic</h3><p>With over 18,000 square feet of pure luxury, Casa de Campo’s spa facilities could be another hotel if desired. The spa is built around its hydrothermal circuit, luring visitors through hot and cold therapies, which is why it’s recommended you arrive an hour ahead of your scheduled treatment. Melding modernity with timeless traditions, guest treatments are held in one of 12 rooms with services spanning therapist-led face and body offerings to self-serving technologies.<em>—Nerisha Penrose, beauty commerce editor</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: The Art of Self Love </h3><p>“An embrace filled with warmth and love does wonders for the mind, body, and soul. The Art of Self-Love at Casa de Campo quite literally wraps the body in a silky milk wrap and then warms up using infrared heat. Meanwhile, your skin gets TLC via a gentle cleanse and massage. The treatment is punctuated with a shower to completely rinse off, and then a body cream is applied to seal in the moisture from your pampering session,” Penrose says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><figure><img title="Moringaia" src="IMG/BB1hxLVb_miracle_oil.jpg" alt="Miracle Oil"><figcaption><em>Miracle Oil . Moringaia</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="body-h2">Conrad Spa </h2><h3 class="body-h3">Tulum, Mexico</h3><p>My fiancé had never been to a spa before we stepped foot in the Conrad Spa Tulum, and by the time we left, we were joking he could never go to one again. After all, why mess with perfection? The spa, surrounded by a tropical jungle, is a campus unto itself—complete with luxe suites for treatments; a large outdoor pool with massaging jets; a bar for coffee and paletas; and a calming locker room with a sauna, steam room, cold plunge, and hot tub, which the staff guides you through for maximum effect. At each juncture, the property’s architecture brings the outdoors in, allowing you to have a true spa experience without missing a day of Tulum sunshine.<em>—Madison Feller, digital deputy editor</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: The Itzamná Journey </h3><p>“This treatment, named after the ancient Mayan god Itzamná, begins with a multisensory meditation that draws upon elements of the natural world, as well as a copal limpia ceremony, in which a massage therapist burns the aromatic resin copal, a sacred scent in Mexican culture. Afterwards, you head to your suite for a nopal and agave body wrap; a massage focused on 13 joints, using warm herbal poultices; and a relaxing full body massage,” Feller says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Maison Sisley</h2><h3 class="body-h3">New York, NY, USA</h3><p>In New York City<strong>, </strong>where a large space is premium real estate, Sisley Paris found a 2,675 square-foot location to build Maison Sisley, their spa in the Meatpacking District. The spot features three long treatment rooms, including one for facials and massages, including LED technology and a Jet Peel; one hair cabin, featuring their Grand Soin scalp treatment inspired by Shiatsu; and a Hair Rituel blow dry area. The spa also features a large retail space where you can check out all the Sisley Paris offerings including makeup, skin care, hair care, and fragrance collections.<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director </em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Hair Rituel </h3><p>“Does your scalp need a facial? Then you’ll absolutely want to book this service. Head spas went viral last year, largely because of their benefits, including hair growth, improved circulation, and decreased stress. This is a luxurious way to get your hair done. The service starts with a pre shampoo combined with a head and neck massage and is completed with a blow out,” James says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">LakeHouse Spa at Lake Austin Spa Resort </h2><h3 class="body-h3">Austin, TX, USA</h3><p>The best way to get to Lake Austin Spa Resort is by boat, of course. The spa will pick you up in a well-appointed motorboat in downtown Austin, Texas, and take you on a leisurely 45-minute cruise to their gorgeous location on the water. There you can dine on one of the best berry salads I’ve ever had in my life, following a signature myofascial release class in their pool barn and a full-body massage. End your time at Lake Austin Spa with a healing sound bath, or consider staying the night in one of their elevated bungalow rooms nestled among sage and cedar trees. The staff is helpful, and the facilities are top-notch. This is a must-do on your next trip to the Lone Star State.<em>—</em><em>Rose Minutaglio</em><em>, senior editor, features & special projects</em></p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Pool Barn Classes</h3><p>“The Lake Austin Spa Resort offers several water classes and therapies. Trust me, you don’t want to skip out on this unique treatment. The signature myofascial release class is heavenly, and if you’re looking for something a little more low-key, there’s aquatic yoga and water massages,” Minutaglio says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Waldorf Astoria Spa</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Las Vegas, NV, USA</h3><p>Take a break from America’s bacchanal, and relax with a spa treatment at the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas. Just off the strip, the hotel spa is one of the most luxurious in Sin City, and the offerings range from seasonal facials to full-body treatments. Consider the sugar glow hydration wrap, which incorporates a full body sugar exfoliation before a nourishing hydration wrap and face massage. Or the Himalayan sphere salt stone massage to help with circulation, sleep, inflammation, and sore muscles.—<em>Rose Minutaglio, </em><em>senior editor</em><em>, features & special projects</em></p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Signature Facial</h3><p>“The Waldorf’s signature facial is customized to address any specific skin care needs. When I arrived at the spa, the aesthetician asked about problem areas and concerns. Then, the aesthetician got to work tailoring my treatment course with different products and techniques. I left feeling rejuvenated and, because this is Vegas after all, ready to party,” Minutaglio says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Dior Spa Plaza Athénée</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Paris, France</h3><p>The Dior woman is one who exudes luxury, elegance, and timeless beauty inside and out. This philosophy holds true at the luxury house’s wellness haven, the Dior Spa at Hotel Plaza Athénée in Paris, from the calming comfort of the cream walls and decor to its indulgent spa offerings that feel like a retreat away from the bustling streets outside. Relaxation lurks at every corner, whether you’re scheduled for a service in one of the five treatment rooms, looking to detox in the sauna, or want to recover at the hammam. Best of all, in one neck of the space, is a first-of-its-kind Light Suite, which uses LED lights to mimic the sun’s radiance and illuminates the skin with three different intensity levels to promote renewal and resynchronization<em>.—</em><em>Nina Garcia</em><em>, editor-in-chief</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Dior Powered by Hydrafacial Holistic Skin Cleansing</h3><p>“When you take Dior’s revitalizing skin care range and couple it with Hydrafacial technology, you get a pristine, luxury facial experience unlike no other. The Dior Powered by Hydrafacial Holistic Skin Cleansing treatment infuses the skin with the Dior Floral Peeling Lotion via the Hydrafacial wand for deep cleansing and exfoliation, which facilitates skin rejuvenation,” Garcia says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">PURE SPA by Natura Bissé at Impression Isla Mujeres by Secrets</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Isla Mujeres, Mexico</h3><p>Everything about Impression Isla Mujeres by Secrets, the newly opened ultra-luxury all-inclusive resort on the low-key Mexican island, is romantic, and the spa is certainly no exception. I, for one, felt wholly relaxed after my 50-minute Swedish Massage, where my specialist indulged me not only with deep rubbing and kneading on my neck<em>—</em>but detox tea, chocolate-covered nuts, Natura Bissé oils, and citrus mint tea. The 9,150-square-foot space also boasts a hydrotherapy circuit, sauna, steam room, and full-service beauty salon, in case you want to keep the pampering going. The exterior itself is so picturesque that guests would pose in front of it.<em>—</em><em>Claire Stern</em><em>, digital director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Swedish Massage</h3><p class="body-text">“If you need a quick destresser—and let’s be real, who doesn’t?—this travel-friendly body oil that smells like fresh lavender will instantly relax you,” Stern says. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">The Spa at The Little Nell</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Aspen, Colorado, USA</h3><p>Just when we thought The Little Nell in Aspen couldn’t get any better, the five-star resort nestled at the base of Ajax opened the city’s only ski-in/ski-out spa. At The Spa at The Little Nell, you can expect an intimate experience and a bespoke treatment menu that focuses on three therapeutic pathways: Recover + Repair, Replenish + Restore, and Reset + Rebalance, in partnership with Dr. Barbara Sturm, Colorado-based organic skin care line ISUN, and all-natural skin care brand Seed to Skin Tuscany. Bonus: Two of the three treatment rooms come equipped with a hybrid infrared sauna with halotherapy.<em>—</em><em>Claire Stern</em><em>, digital director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Super Anti-Aging Facial</h3><p class="body-text">“If you can’t make it to Aspen this season, the good news is you can apply Dr. Sturm’s anti-aging serum at home—and the effects are both immediate and long-lasting. The powerful formula smoothes and hydrates the skin while reducing fine lines and wrinkles. If you need proof that it works, just look at Sturm herself,” Stern says. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Velvet Spa at Ambiente </h2><h3 class="body-h3">Sedona, AZ, USA</h3><p>Take a deep breath<strong>. </strong>Now exhale. That immediate whoosh of relaxation that comes over you—that’s the overall ambiance at Ambiente. Nestled in Sedona and surrounded by nature, it’s hard not to leave feeling grounded and in touch with nature. Velvet, Ambiente’s spa, caters its wellness program to all and encourages couples to book a spa day together via their array of offerings. If you go alone, gift yourself to a healing treatment rooted in the Indigenous traditions of the area, including their Sacred Sedona Clay Wrap, which sources local clay, per Velvet’s spa director, Deborah Waldvogel. “The clay boasts remarkable detoxifying properties and a wealth of nutrients,” she says. As you are enveloped in the clay wrap, it really works to absorb toxins from the skin while you enjoy a rejuvenating scalp, hand, and foot massage.<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: The Ultimate Duo </h3><p>“This isn’t a treatment; it’s an exceptional 90-minute journey for you and your partner encompassing a salt/sugar scrub, luxurious wrap, a choice of scalp massage with either warm oil or a dry option, and culminating in a wonderfully soothing full body massage. However, what really makes this treatment special is the focus on scent. It is well-known that fragrance can help revive lost memories and further embed moments in your mind. In this treatment, couples get to choose the fragrance that will be seamlessly woven throughout their treatment. You can each choose separate fragrances, but I think it is more fun to choose one together,” James says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Ocean Club Spa by L’Occitane</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Sosúa, Dominican Republic</h3><p>Tranquility blankets Ocean Club Costa Norte long before you enter its spa doors. Nestled on the north coast of the Dominican Republic, Ocean Club is a wellness playground that perches over a sandy beach with a restless ocean barricaded by uneven rocks that looks like a scene out of a movie. Hanging leaves adorn the pathway to the spa’s doors; behind them is an aromatic blend with hints of eucalyptus and lavender permeating the space. The spa is complete with private and couples suites, personal-sized steam rooms, and a lounging area that makes you forget there’s a whole world outside its wooden doors. When your spa day is up, indulge in the cabanas lining one of three pools on the premises (an infinity pool faces the private beach on one side, while a heated jacuzzi rests on the other), take an evening reservation at the hotel’s La Roca bar to watch the sunset, or luxuriate in the expansive, apartment-style hotel room stocked with Byredo goodies.<em>—Nerisha Penrose, beauty commerce editor</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Deep Tissue Intense Relief Massage</h3><p>“If you could leave your body on the Ocean Club Spa’s massage table and pick it back up after your 50-minute massage, you’ll return to skin smoother than a dolphin, softened, relaxed feet relieved from travel exhaustion, and a renewed spirit ready to invite more of the tranquility Ocean Club Costa Norte has to offer. Essentially, that’s exactly what happens when you opt for the Deep Tissue Intense Relief Massage. Taking cues from Indian healing practices coupled with Sousa’s local ingredients, the treatment begins with a soothing foot bath where the stress and anxiety trapped in your pressure points are released with pulsing touches. Designed primarily for sport-strained muscles—or, in my case, journalist’s shoulders—the therapist uses slow, controlled strokes to address tight muscles and tension prohibiting you from complete serenity. As time rolls on, pressure intensifies and deepens from your shoulders, back, legs, feet, and hands. You’re guaranteed to make another appointment before your departure,” Penrose says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Canyon Ranch Lenox</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Lenox, MA, USA</h3><p>Canyon Ranch isn’t a destination, it’s a lifestyle, and once you experience a few days on their Lenox, Massachusetts, property, it’s hard to not want to take it home with you. Unexpectedly, this retreat kickstarted a 10-pound weight loss for me. Canyon Ranch focuses on mind, body, and soul—a trifecta that can help anyone improve all aspects of their lifestyle, and I tried to do one thing in each bucket each day. It’s like an adult summer camp, allowing you to delve into your interests. You can pack your schedule, or leave it as open as you want. The property is beautiful, and there is so much to take advantage of, including bike rides off-property, cooking classes, and even a tarot card reading (yes, I did all). They have the best doctors in the country, and a fellow guest shared that they come annually for their yearly check up, in addition to rest and relaxation. On my birthday, I received an Ayurvedic treatment and had a spiritual ritual done to bring in my personal new year. I enjoy how the property takes the best of various medicines and thought to give a well-rounded experience for guests.<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Yon-Ka Paris Relaxing Journey</h3><p>“The double sugar scrub enveloped my nose with floral notes with an emphasis on jasmine while exfoliating my skin and leaving it super smooth and buttery. Followed by an aromatherapeutic massage featuring volcanic hot stones, the heat therapy deepened my relaxation and released all the tension from my muscles. I left feeling so relaxed and with a willingness to return, specifically for this treatment,” James says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Mandara Spa</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Paradise Island, Bahamas</h3><p>Mandara Spa at Atlantis nearly convinced me to extend my stay in the Bahamas. You have to visit this wellness haven once you’ve had your fill of adventure. Upon entering, the spa’s cozy, dim ambiance lets you know that you’re in a space where your wellness is a priority. Balinese influences and Bahamian ingredients are the highlight of guest treatments. Plus, you can schedule a hair service, work out in the fitness center, or even take a swim in the spa’s warm and cold plunge pools.<em>—</em><em>Carine Lavache</em><em>, senior content strategist</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Hot Mineral Body Boost </h3><p>“Looking for a quartz crystal bed to relax in? After the therapist assesses your needs, you’ll be led to the heated minerals to prepare your body for a soothing custom massage. Allow yourself to relax as a healing amber balm absorbs into your skin,” Lavache says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">The Spa at PGA National Resort</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA</h3><p>A short walk through a lush, palm tree-filled pathway leads you to the secluded oasis that is The Spa at PGA National Resort. Upon entry to the recently updated 40,000-square-foot spa, you’re greeted by a friendly staff and tranquil interior. The dimly lit lounge is the perfect space to set the tone for a day of pampering. After your treatment, spend the day relaxing outdoors by the two mineral pools, taking a deep breath inside the salt room, or sweating it out in the sauna.<em>—</em><em>Laura Hacker</em><em>, senior video producer</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Facial of Champions</h3><p>“As someone looking for a ‘skin reset,’ this facial checked all the boxes. This signature treatment begins with a glycolic peel to remove dull skin. A mix of red and blue light LED therapy followed, killing bacteria and brightening the complexion. The most satisfying part happened next, where lead aesthetician, Belle Franco, concocted a mineral mask made from fresh seaweed. The mask sets on my face while I received a scalp, neck, and shoulder massage. Upon removal of the mask, my skin was left feeling plump and hydrated, like I haven’t experienced before,” Hacker says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Spa Kwa Maningi at Chobe Game Lodge</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Serondela, Botswana, Africa</h3><p>Looking for a royal spa experience worthy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? Then look no further than Spa Kwa Maningi at the Chobe Game Lodge in Botswana. Prince Harry visited the eco-friendly five-star lodge during his conservation efforts and even sourced the center diamond in Meghan’s engagement ring from Botswana. As the only lodge in Chobe National Park, you can spend your days on safari spotting majestic elephants splashing in the river, then indulge in your own luxurious bathing ritual with a Desert Glow Back Exfoliation, an African Boabab Facial Cleanse, and a traditional Rungu Massage. One hour with Wendy, the Chobe Angel masseuse, will leave you looking as smooth and graceful as an impala. Who knows? You might even fall in love with your own prince in the bush. In Africa, anything is possible.—<em>Yousra Attia, photo editor</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: African Rolling River Sands </h3><p class="body-text">“The masseuse Wendy was very attentive and made sure to help me feel relaxed the whole time. She tried to make it a very enjoyable experience for me. For 90 minutes, the Chobe River served as background music and added to the relaxation of my deep tissue massage,” Attia says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Acqua Spa at O2 Beach Club</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Barbados</h3><p>Barbados is the premiere destination in the eastern Caribbean with a deep focus on hospitality and catering to tourists, particularly Americans and Europeans. Acqua Spa is located on the top floor of the five-star O2 Beach Club, spanning almost 6,000 square feet and giving guests panoramic, floor-to-ceiling views of the Caribbean Sea. It also features Barbados’ only hammam experience. Focusing on marine ingredients for treatments, you are guaranteed to switch to island time, and get lost in a relaxing state.<em>—Danielle James, digital beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Sea of Life Facial </h3><p>“Seaweed in skin care? Yes, if you want hydrated, healthy skin. The benefits are endless, and Acqua Spa takes advantage of local offerings to create custom and unique experiences specific to the needs of your skin. The Sea of Life Facial begins with a skin analysis to determine its needs. The treatment, like many at this spa, uses Osea products, which are known for using ingredients from the sea to provide optimal benefits to your skin,” James says. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">SHA Costa Mujeres</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Isla Mujeres, Mexico</h3><p>SHA Mexico is a wellness haven you’ll never want to leave—and technically, you don’t have to. Unlike most spas, where services are one-and-done, this one invites you to experience its serene oasis for days on end. The secluded out-post offers four to 21-day retreats that are tailored to your every concern, whether you’re looking to rebalance and reenergize for a few days, or want a head start on preventative care.<em>—Nina Garcia, editor-in-chief</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Well-Ageing and Prevention</h3><p>“With age comes woes we’d rather not think about or address. At SHA Mexico, you’re equipped with professionals who help you take on these challenges through a series of programs, like the Well-ageing & Prevention. Designed to identify what inhibitors are a threat to your biological clock, this wellness path utilizes natural therapies, technologies, and physical activity to reset your metabolism and slow down aging,” Garcia says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Clé de Peau Beauté Salon</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Tokyo, Japan</h3><p>Located on the “Fifth Avenue” of Tokyo, Shiseido’s spa is tucked inside a multilevel building that looks as shiny as lacquer. Designed by architect Klein Dytham, the spa is located on the building’s third floor, with a futuristic yet glossy, minimal design and a sense of quietness that imparts serenity. Treatment rooms are completely sound-proof so that you have no sense of when someone is coming and going, and the aestheticians are hushed and quiet, so that there is nothing to distract from a truly excellent facial.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Synactif Skincare Facial </h3><p>“In the ’80s and ’90s, Japanese companies popularized the idea of ‘six sigma’—the idea of continuous process improvement. It has been decades, but I couldn’t help but think about the idea of perfecting a facial protocol, over and over again until it becomes perfect, when I was lying on the spa bed in the Ginza Shiseido signature store. My facial was a leisurely one and a half hours (but felt like two), and every movement and pressure point felt like it was tailor made to decongest my pores and massage my face to achieve max radiance and slimness. At the very end, a hardened clay face mask (not for the claustrophobic) sucked all the gunk out of my pores and calmed my skin,” Hou says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Amangiri</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Canyon Point, UT, USA</h3><p>Amangiri is known for effortlessly blending in the man-made with nature, and the spa is no different. Nestled within 25,000 square feet of the Utah desert, its design harmoniously blends water and stone, and to get to the treatment rooms, you walk over a stone pathway on top of a serene pond. The walkway into the darkly lit spa is bedecked with hundreds of lit candles, and the continuous sound of running water instantly puts you into a “spa” frame of mind.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Grounding Massage </h3><p>“If you’re going to be at Amangiri, the resort known as a favorite of Hailey Bieber and where the pool is literally carved into a mountainside, you obviously need to see every inch of the property, including the spa. And while you’re there, you might as well get a massage, and check out the sauna, cold plunge pool, and their lesser-known pool (where an influencer told me is the best secret place to take photos),” Hou says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">The Wellspring Spa at Regent Taipei</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Taipei, Taiwan</h3><p>A busy hotel with an iconic circular driveway that’s often home to ambassador cars and those who want to show off their luxury cars, the spa within is surprisingly quiet and lacking in ostentation. Treatment rooms feel more like hotel suites, and its central location makes it easy to grab a great dinner afterwards.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Massage </h3><p>“My mom and I have a little ‘treat yourself’ ritual whenever we visit family in Taipei. We give ourselves a little night off from visiting relatives by booking massages at this luxury hotel in the middle of Taipei. I like that massages end with a little bath soak (because who wants to put clothes on over greasy skin), and that treatment rooms include a beautiful view of Taipei,” Hou says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><figure><img title="Själ" src="IMG/BB1hxSRZ_kashmir_saphir.jpg" alt="Kashmir Saphir"><figcaption><em>Kashmir Saphir.

And then the rainfall shower at a perfectly calibrated warm temperature came on.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: D Balance </h3><p>“I knew this massage was going to be different when I noticed that the aesthetician’s Dior-logoed dress was waterproof. And I really knew it was going to be different when midway through the massage, she turned on the rainfall shower and started massaging my back muscles through the spray. I didn’t know water massages existed, but I hope that all my massages are done through water now. The dual effects of warm water and massage (plus steam, so technically trial) left me extremely relaxed, and my body feeling like jelly,” Hou says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Golden Door</h2><h3 class="body-h3">San Marcos, CA, USA</h3><figure><img title="Tanveer Badal Photography / TANVEERBADAL.COM" src="IMG/BB1hxSS9_golden_door_spa_tanveer_badal_hires_16jpg.jpg" alt="golden-door-spa-tanveer-badal-hires-16.jpg"><figcaption><em>Golden Door Spa. Tanveer Badal Photography / TANVEERBADAL.COM</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some people like to “suffer” in the name of wellness—but not me. No needles, please. No mandated boot camps, please. No almond-only snacks, please. Prior to visiting Golden Door, a fancy wellness resort that’s been around since the ’80s, I wasn’t sure if I would like or fit in amongst the other fancy guests, which have included Julianne Moore and Julia Roberts. But I found that every activity—including astrology, mountainous hikes, yoga—was voluntary, dessert was included with every meal, and the spa services (daily in-room massages, pedicures/facials every other day) to be calming and extraordinary.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Massage</h3><p>“No matter how many days you stay at fancy wellness resort Golden Door, lucky attendees enjoy the daily massages as part of the ‘protocol.’ But if you need something more, there is the Healing Stone Massage, which uses warm stone and cool marble, to balance energy and soothe sore muscles,” Hou says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Surya</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Santa Monica, CA, USA</h3><p>Once located in a private neighborhood in the Pacific Palisades, the new Surya Spa, an Ayurvedic destination helmed by herbalist Martha Soffer, is now in Los Angeles’ Santa Monica Proper Hotel. Much like the rest of the hotel, the treatment rooms and spa are designed by Kelly Wearstler. With warm earth tones, the center of the spa is a communal kitchen, where clients gather post-treatment. Open shelving showcases a wide assortment of herbs held in mason jars, giving a homey apothecary feel, and every guest is offered a rejuvenating hot drink (generally a latte or a hot chocolate) and what the aestheticians called “spa bread” (also sold at Erewhon), made on-site.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Signature Abhyanga Massage </h3><p>“Four hand massage. That’s all I have to say. I only had 30 minutes of this signature ayurvedic massage at Surya, but I can only imagine how good 60 minutes of it would feel. Using customized herbal oils, this massage, done with two technicians, is meant to open up your energy channels. Having been drizzled thoroughly with warm oil, I felt sort of like a well-kneaded piece of focaccia at the end. Maybe the best part of the massage is that it ends with a slice of warm, toasted bread and ghee at the spa's communal kitchen,” Hou says.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Try Something Similar:</h3><h2 class="body-h2">Wildflower Farms</h2><h3 class="body-h3">Gardiner, NY, USA</h3><p>Auberge’s Wildflower Farms is located a few hours away from New York in Gardiner. At the center of the property is the brand’s roaring fire pit, forever lit and a cozy beacon to gather to grab food or catch up with friends. Just adjacent to the bonfire is the Thistle Spa. A large heated indoor pool with plush lounge sofas serves as the waiting area, and treatments are held downstairs. The gift shop showcasing crafts, beauty products, clothing, and artwork that are flora-focused is also an excellent browse.<em>—Kathleen Hou, beauty director</em> </p><p><em>Book your treatment here.</em></p><h3 class="body-h3">Treatment to Try: Botanical Deep Tissue </h3><p>“For anyone looking for a great massage in the Hudson area, look to the new-ish Wildflower Farms.
