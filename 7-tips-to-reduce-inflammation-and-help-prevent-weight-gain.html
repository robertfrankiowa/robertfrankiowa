Thanks to advances in research, we now know that the longstanding advice to just eat less and exercise is way too simplistic, because there are so many other factors at play. </p><p>One of those factors is chronic inflammation, which has been linked to metabolic health, obesity, and weight gain. “Obesity is a disease of inflammation,” says Sandy Van, MD, an obesity physician and medical advisor to Obesity Matters. “Excess fat tissue itself is inflammatory.” </p><p>While there is still a lot to learn about the nature of the relationship between chronic inflammation and weight, the good news is that there are many ways to keep inflammation in check with simple lifestyle changes. Doing so can help address some of the underlying causes of obesity and weight gain, improving your odds of success and giving you options for reaching your health and weight goals that go beyond diet and exercise alone. </p><h2>How Inflammation Contributes to Weight Gain </h2><p>Excess body fat clearly triggers inflammation, according to Dr. Van. Fat cells, called adipocytes, secrete inflammatory proteins, studies have found. And as weight increases, so does inflammation, per other research, which can cause a vicious cycle. </p><p>But whether the opposite is true — that inflammation causes people to gain weight — is not exactly clear. “There isn’t enough evidence for me to say that inflammation in isolation causes weight gain or obesity,” Van says. </p><p>Chronic inflammation can, however, exacerbate insulin resistance, a condition where the body’s cells don’t respond well to insulin, which makes weight loss harder and predisposes someone to type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is independently linked to weight gain. “There’s probably a lot more to it than we know,” says Van.</p><h2>7 Ways to Lower Inflammation and Help Prevent Weight Gain</h2><p>Many of the factors that cause chronic inflammation are the same ones that cause weight gain. The good news is that a lot of these things are within your power to change. Here are seven steps you can take to help fight chronic inflammation. </p><h3>1. Get Moving</h3><p>Moving your body can feel good, support healthy sleep, and aid stress management, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes. It’s also a powerful protector against inflammation. Exercise — both cardiovascular and strength training — reduces inflammation, according to research<em>. </em>“Ideally, try to get 30 minutes of physical activity a day, at least five days a week,” says Raksha Shah, RD, founder of Wisebite Nutrition, based in New Jersey. </p><h3>2. Make Plants the Star of Your Plate</h3><p>Filling your plate with vegetables is a good way to help avoid weight gain, in part because they drive down inflammation, according to research. “Leafy greens like spinach, kale, chard, arugula, endive, turnip greens, beet greens, and collard greens all contain vitamins and other nutrients found to reduce chronic inflammation,” says Shah.</p><h3>3. Quit Smoking (and Avoid Starting if You Don’t)</h3><p>As if you needed another reason to quit cigarettes. Smoking was strongly associated with increased markers of inflammation in a study. Using e-cigarettes or vaping is no better, according to research.</p><h3>4. Limit Alcohol Intake</h3><p>Every time you grab a beer or sip a martini, it triggers an inflammatory response. As your body breaks down the alcohol, a variety of inflammatory compounds flood your system, according to research. “If you drink at all, do so in moderation,” says Shah. No amount of alcohol is considered safe for health, according to the World Health Organization.</p><h3>5. Make Sleep a Priority</h3><p>Because inconsistent sleep is associated with increased inflammation, research suggests, it stands to reason that sleeping well can help fight inflammation. “You should try to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night,” says Shah. “A good night’s sleep usually involves going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, turning off screens before you lie down, and sleeping in a dark, slightly cool room.” </p><h3>6. Try Yoga and Meditation</h3><p>Stress is linked to inflammation, and meditation techniques that help calm stress may also tamp down that response, research indicates. “These ancient practices focus on breathing. It helps reduce stress and anxiety,” says Shah. One meta-analysis found that meditation may alter the brain’s response to stressful stimuli, and these changes may be linked to decreased levels of inflammatory markers in the blood. The authors note that the practice may be particularly useful when combined with other lifestyle changes to combat inflammation.</p><p>Shah recommends loading up your food with spices. You have several options. The active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Certain compounds in ginger can help tamp down inflammation, according to research. Garlic also tames inflammation, according to an overview of the research. </p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Just as with losing weight in general, there’s no magic bullet for reducing inflammation. If you are struggling with your weight, however, taking these steps may help get you closer to your goal. </p><p>“Obesity is not a choice,” says Van. “It’s a chronic, progressive disease with complex biological underpinnings.” Inflammation, driven by lifestyle factors like diet, stress, and inactivity, may be one piece of that puzzle. And because it is known to create a cycle that continuously contributes to weight gain, leading to metabolic disorders and increased disease risk, chronic inflammation is a very important piece. </p><p>By incorporating strategies like plant-based eating, regular exercise, mindful sleep habits, and stress reduction, you can help break this cycle, reduce inflammation, and set the foundation for sustainable weight management.</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
