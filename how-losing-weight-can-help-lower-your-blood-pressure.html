    <main><h1>How Losing Weight Can Help Lower Your Blood Pressure</h1><p>High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a complex condition. Although the reasons for having high blood pressure are multifactorial and include genetic factors, age, some chronic health conditions, side effects of certain medications, and more, there is a relationship between being at a higher weight and having high blood pressure.</p><p>Generally speaking, the higher your weight, the greater your risk of developing high blood pressure.</p><p>Your body’s blood pressure is crucial for the supply of blood and oxygen to your tissues and organs. “But when blood pressure is too high, this causes damage to our blood vessels and the organs and tissues they supply, leading to complications like strokes, heart attacks, and kidney disease,” says Dan Maselli, MD, a board-certified internal medicine, gastroenterology, and obesity medicine physician and the associate director of research for True You Weight Loss in Cary, North Carolina.</p><p>One effective strategy for gaining control over high blood pressure and avoiding potential complications is weight loss. This simple yet powerful step may significantly improve your health.</p><h2>The Link Between Weight and Blood Pressure</h2><p>Research shows that 60 to 77 percent of people with obesity (a body mass index of 30 or above) have hypertension, compared with 34 percent of people who are at a healthy weight.</p><p>Your heart is a muscle, and like any other muscle, there’s only so much weight it can handle. “Extra weight is an increased mechanical stress on the body, so the more tissue you have, the more demand for your circulation. Because there’s more demand, the heart has to work harder,” says Meghan Garcia-Webb, MD, a board-certified internal medicine, lifestyle medicine, and obesity medicine physician in Wellesley, Massachusetts.</p><p>This increased demand harms your body, including how your kidneys function. Your kidneys play an essential role in regulating blood pressure. “If [your kidneys] sense that they’re getting less blood than they’re used to, they’ll try to fix this through various signaling mechanisms that cause the muscles around the blood vessels to clamp down so you’re getting more pressure,” Dr. Garcia-Webb says.</p><p>Blood vessels clamping down or constricting (vasoconstriction) also puts your body in “fight-or-flight” mode, which occurs when your sympathetic nervous system activates in response to danger or stress.</p><p>Normally, this stress response helps you cope with stress and escape life-threatening situations. But if your kidneys constantly tell your blood vessels to constrict, your body can get stuck in fight-or-flight mode. “That can impair the ability of the blood vessels to fully relax, creating stiffness,” Garcia-Webb says. The stiffer your blood vessels, the harder your heart must work to pump blood through them.</p><h2>How Weight Loss Lowers Blood Pressure</h2><p>The good news: Losing as few as 10 pounds can help you manage or prevent high blood pressure, says the American Heart Association (AHA). In fact, research found that losing 2 to 4 kilograms (4.4 to 8.8 pounds) is associated with a 3 to 8 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure, which is pretty significant.</p><p>“When you have more weight, you’re adding more to your body’s workload, and when you take weight away, your body can function more efficiently,” Garcia-Webb says. One study in patients with obesity found that decreasing body weight by 14.3 to 20.7 pounds helped lower stress hormone levels and resting blood pressure. This suggests that losing weight helped alleviate physical stress, allowing their bodies to pump blood more efficiently.</p><h2>Other Healthy Habits Can Also Help Treat High Blood Pressure</h2><p>Although weight loss can improve blood pressure by relieving some of the stress on your heart, weight loss on its own may not be sufficient for improving blood pressure. Healthy habits such as adjusting your diet and being physically active are also helpful. For instance, you may lose weight eating a high-sodium diet, but you’ll still retain more fluid. “That’s going to cause your heart to work harder,” Garcia-Webb says.</p><p>Follow these healthy habits for treating high blood pressure.</p><h3>1. Exercise Regularly</h3><p>Exercise — particularly cardio — has a well-earned reputation for boosting heart health. A review of 73 studies on patients with and without hypertension suggests that walking at a moderate intensity for an average of 153 minutes per week can lower systolic blood pressure by more than 4 mmHg. That’s on par with physical activity recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><h3>2. Eat a Healthy, Low-Sodium Diet</h3><p>Limiting sodium to 1,500 milligrams per day, eating a diet focused on whole foods (such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and dairy products), and minimizing sugary drinks, packaged snacks, and red meat may improve blood pressure as well.</p><p>These principles are the cornerstone of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, an eating pattern created by the National Institutes of Health that can decrease systolic blood pressure by 6 to 11 mmHg, per research. Your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian can work with you on how to best treat your hypertension.</p><h3>3. Reduce Stress</h3><p>Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. It can be challenging to reduce stress, though, as researchers say there are multiple forces out of many people’s control that may contribute to stress. Those include job stress, social isolation, being of a lower socioeconomic status, racial discrimination, and more.</p><p>You can’t avoid stress altogether, but you can lessen its effects by learning to say no to tasks and commitments, resolving issues at work and at home, and taking time for activities you enjoy. Stress reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, deep breathing, and visualization can also help you relax throughout the day.</p><h3>4. Improve Sleep</h3><p>Sleeping fewer than the recommended seven to nine hours per night can have a negative effect on blood pressure. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says that people who don’t get enough sleep — or who wake often during the night — are at a higher risk of high blood pressure.</p><p>To keep your blood pressure under control, focus on creating healthy sleep habits like going to bed and waking up at the same time each day; limiting naps; avoiding large meals, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, and bright light close to bedtime; and doing a relaxing activity before bed. See your doctor for help with sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, insomnia, and any health condition that disrupts sleep.</p><p>If you currently smoke, speak with your doctor for help with quitting. Smoking and hypertension are closely linked; your blood pressure has a short-term spike every time you puff, per the AHA. So visit your healthcare provider for advice on quitting. They may recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Excess weight is a significant contributor to high blood pressure. It adds stress to the heart, blood vessels, and organs, causing changes that can lead blood pressure to skyrocket. Losing a modest amount of weight, such as 10 pounds, can ease the strain on your heart and make your blood pressure easier to manage.</p><p>While weight loss alone can help, don’t underestimate the importance of diet and exercise in lowering blood pressure. These healthy lifestyle changes can also play a big role in treating your hypertension.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
