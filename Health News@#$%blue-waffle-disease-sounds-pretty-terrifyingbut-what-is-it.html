Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>The internet has made information more accessible than ever. Whether you're looking for a nearby coffee shop or a new recipe to try, you can get most of the information you need within seconds. </p><p>However, not all of that information is accurate, and this unfortunate truth can carry risks—especially in the health and wellness space. </p><p>One example is "blue waffle disease." The fake sexually transmitted infection has been debunked numerous times since rumors of it spread in 2010. Yet, despite repeated messages that blue waffle disease does not exist, including a 2017 article by Dr. Anita Ravi, MD, MPH for <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>, the term remains a viral one in certain corners of the Internet.</p><p>"Social media hoaxes are often created as click-bait by people who want to go viral, making it really important to be aware of the source of the health-related content you’re consuming," says <strong>Dr. Kenosha Gleaton, MD, </strong>a board-certified OB-GYN and an Everlywell medical advisor.</p><p>Notably, some of the reported symptoms of blue waffle disease could be red flags for other illnesses. Doctors discussed the blue waffle disease meaning and spread insights on STI symptoms, testing, treatment and prevention. </p><h2>What Is Blue Waffle Disease?</h2><p>We don't recommend searching for it on Instagram. The photos are definitely NSFW, and the blue waffle disease meaning—despite the captions—is "false STI." </p><p>"Blue waffle disease is a fake condition that has been disseminated on social media claiming that it is an STI with features of the vagina becoming inflamed and the vulva turning blue," explains <strong>Dr. Denise Pate, MD</strong>, a board-certified internal medicine physician, the medical director of Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to LabFinder.com. </p><p>So, how did we get here?</p><p>"Blue waffle disease...started after a photoshopped image of a blue, swollen, and scabby vagina started circulating the internet," Dr. Gleaton says.</p><p>The jarring images have people scared about this "new" STI, which, Dr. Gleaton stresses, does not actually doesn't exist. The rise of AI has also made it easier than ever to create and doctor images, warns <strong>Dr. Kecia Gaither, MD, MPH, MS, MBA, FACOG, Gaither, </strong>the director of perinatal services/maternal-fetal medicine at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln in the Bronx.</p><p>In addition to Dr. Ravi's 2017 debunk session, Planned Parenthood also put out an article declaring that "Blue Waffle" is "100% not real."</p><h2>'Blue Waffle Disease' Symptoms Might Be Signs of Other Illnesses</h2><p>While blue waffle disease is not real, the reported symptoms could be red flags for other conditions, sexually transmitted or not, Dr. Gaither explains. She says these issues include:</p><ul><li><strong>Yeast infections (monilial infection): </strong>These are caused by fungus and are not sexually transmitted. Dr. Gaither says signs include itching, swelling, redness and "cottage-cheese-like" discharge.</li><li><strong>Herpes:</strong> An infection that can be sexually transmitted and trigger symptoms like painful, reddened ulcers on the genitals and fever.</li><li><strong>Gonorrhea: </strong>An STI that can also affect the throat, rectum and genitals. Dr.  Gaither says signs in women may include increased vaginal discharge, pelvic pain and painful poops.</li><li><strong>Chlamydia: </strong>A sexually transmitted and can include flags like burning with urination, rectal and pelvic pain and vaginal discharge.</li><li><strong>Bacterial vaginosis: </strong>This is not sexually transmitted and is caused by a bacterial imbalance. Signs include vaginal pain, itching and discharge, sometimes with a fishy odor.</li><li><strong>Trichomoniasis: </strong>A sexually transmitted and can include yellow, gray or green frothy discharge with a foul odor. Dr. Gaither says vaginal itching, burning and swelling and painful sex are among other red flags.</li><li><strong>Syphilis</strong>: A sexually transmitted infection that can cause sores on the mouth, sex organs and rectum.</li></ul><p>"It's important that [a person] with any unusual symptoms...seek medical care," Dr. Gaither says. </p><h2>STI Prevention</h2><p>There's no doubt about it: STIs are unpleasant. But ideally, you can prevent STIs from happening in the first place.</p><p>"Most STIs are passed through skin-to-skin contact or coming into contact with infected sexual fluid," Dr. Gleaton says. "The best way to avoid getting an STI is to have open conversations with any partner about their STI status before engaging in sexual activity and using condoms for penetrative sex."</p><h2>STI Testing, Diagnosis and Treatment</h2><p>Dr. Gleaton. also recommends staying up-to-date on your STI status through testing, something Dr. Pate echoed.</p><p>"Depending on the STI, the test modality differs. HIV, hepatitis, syphilis and herpes are all tested via blood tests," Dr. Pate says. "Gonorrhea and chlamydia are tested via urine and throat swab. If someone participates in receptive anal sex, they can be tested for rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia by a rectal swab."</p><p>Dr. Gleaton adds that at-home tests are also available. "At-home tests use similar methods of collection based on the type of STI you’re screening for," Dr. Gleaton says. "The biggest difference is that you collect those samples at home and send them in for lab testing."</p><p>While you hope your tests come back negative, treatments are likely available should they not.</p><p>"The good news is that, while STIs sound scary, most are easily curable with antibiotics," Dr. Gleaton. "It’s important to catch them early. If left untreated, STIs can cause long-term, more serious health problems."</p></main>
