    <main><h1>'At 9 Months Postpartum, I Committed To The Workout Program Bodi To Overhaul My Health'</h1><p>During my second pregnancy with my daughter, I gained 50 pounds. After I gave birth, at 26 years old, I realized my knees hurt from the extra weight. I found myself in a new season of feeling very uncomfortable in my skin and being unable to move as comfortably as before. </p><p>I found myself out of breath trying to play with my children. My body ached. I had a realization that this wasn't who I wanted to be. I was tired. I was using food as an emotional crutch. I felt myself sinking further into a state of depression. </p><h2 class="body-h2">By nine months postpartum, I knew I had to reprioritize both my physical and mental health.</h2><p>I could work out anytime in my crazy schedule with little children. I developed consistency with many new habits, such as taking more steps daily. I started with no weights or equipment—which allowed me to begin with no excuses and no barriers to entry. </p><p>I still do BODi workouts today, and I eventually signed up to be an ambassador. I was a regular client for over four years before I signed up as an ambassador—I simply loved and believed in the program so much—and it’s kept me accountable like nothing else.</p><figure><img title="bodi.com" src="IMG/BB1mdi7w_21_day_fix.jpg" alt="21-Day Fix"><figcaption><em>21-Day Fix. bodi.com</em></figcaption></figure><p> For me, it's fitness that fits a busy lifestyle and for any season. My workouts are usually 20 to 40 minutes, five to six days a week, depending on the program I’m doing. They offer everything from yoga and Pilates to barre, lifting, HIIT, cardio, fusion, dance, and more. The at-home fitness library also incorporates nutrition programs as well.</p><p>Having a program to follow—and there are *so* many amazing workout programs out there, so find what works for <em>you!—</em>made it way easier for me to actually get my workout in each day. Going to the gym took so much time, but this keeps me consistent. I can squeeze in home workouts anytime.</p><p>I now lead groups online for community, collaboration, and accountability to help more mamas like me. We do the workouts together, virtually cheering each other on. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Recently, I have been really loving to lift heavy. </h2><p>As I get older, lifting has been the thing to change my body. I used to do endless cardio to lose weight. Now it’s about feeling good and being strong.</p><p>I also mix up my routine by hopping on my MYX II stationary bike for steady-state cardio three times a week and I go on daily walks with my two puppies. </p><p>At first I just wanted to work out to lose weight, but I soon realized it was about so much more. I felt better, I wasn’t depressed anymore. I could chase and play with my kids with energy and felt alive again.</p><h2 class="body-h2">I also overhauled my nutrition.</h2><p>When BODi came out with the 21-Day Fix program, I decided I was going to give it a try, and it helped me overhauled my diet, as it focuses on mastering portion control. You put food in little color coded containers that helped me easily learn what foods to eat daily and healthy portions. </p><p>I felt like I finally could gain some control over my out of control eating habits. I’ve been able to stick with BODi for over 10 years. (I'm now 42!) I know what my body needs and how to feel my best every day. </p><p>Now my diet is about helping my body stay strong and fueling well for my workouts. I eat a good balance of protein, fruit, vegetables, and whole grains like oatmeal and quinoa. I still eat dessert everyday, usually protein cookie dough or brownies. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Since my transformation, I’ve been a more present and active mom. </h2><p>My habits and behaviors have influenced my kids to start their own fitness journeys, as well as my husband. A few years after I started my transformation journey, my husband joined me doing my workouts and following my nutrition habits–and he also lost 50 pounds. Now it is something we share! It is huge for our relationship as we’ve grown and changed over the years. </p><p>My biggest takeaway has been that the journey can’t be solely focused on weight loss. It has to be about, yes, the<em> journey</em>—the habits, the lifestyle, and the life you are gaining<i>. </i>For me, that includes gaining muscle and getting stronger with lifting. I've gained so much confidence and joy throughout my journey, and you can too.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
