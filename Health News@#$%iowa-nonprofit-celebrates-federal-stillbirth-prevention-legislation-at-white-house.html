Emily Price/For the Register</em></figcaption></figure><p>Twenty years ago, five Iowa women who lost children to stillbirth came together in their grief. </p><p>This week, they witnessed the nation's top officials discuss new legislation that, for the first time, expressly allows states to spend federal dollars on stillbirth prevention efforts. </p><p>The founders of the Clive-based non-profit Healthy Birth Day traveled to Washington, D.C., on Monday to celebrate the passage of the Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth Prevention Act. The group had championed for the legislation as part of its decades-long efforts to prevent stillbirths, which growing research has shown can be prevented in as many as 1 in 4 cases.</p><p><strong><em>In the lead-up to the 2020 election, all eyes are on Iowa.

"There’s no reason why they’re not sharing life-saving messages with parents. The results are deadly."</p><p>Healthy Birth Day was founded in 2009 by Petersen, Jan Caruthers, Kerry Biondi-Morlan, Kate Safris and Tiffan Yamen. All five lost daughters to stillbirth or shortly after birth. Their daughters' names were Grace, Jayden, Grace, Emma and Madeline.</p><p>Since then, the group has become one of the nation's leading voices in stillbirth prevention. </p><p>“It was a thrilling moment for the five founders of Healthy Birth Day and Count the Kicks to see our dream of stillbirth prevention making its way to the White House and actually come to fruition," said Petersen, who also serves as a state legislator representing Des Moines.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What does this federal legislation do?</h2><p>The bill, which was sponsored by Iowa U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, passed the House in May. It passed the Senate last month and sent to the president's desk for signature. </p><p>Healthy Birth Day CEO Emily Price said the new legislation is a call to action from Congress and the Biden Administration for state health departments to use federal dollars for stillbirth prevention. While the language of the bill does not explicitly require states to use federal funding for these efforts, Price said this move helps shine light on the crisis.</p><p>Price said only 20 state health departments are currently using these existing funds on stillbirth prevention programming like Count the Kicks, a program created by Healthy Birth Day.</p><p>“At the end of the day, it saves lives when you have in the room the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) all being asked by the Biden Administration ‘what are you doing to prevent stillbirths?’ That is a really strong message saying ‘we’re keeping an eye on this and Congress is keeping an eye on this,'" Price said.</p><p>Every year, roughly 21,000 pregnancies in the U.S. end in stillbirth, or the death of a child at 20 weeks of pregnancy or more, according to the CDC. </p><p>A growing body of research shows steps can be taken to prevent stillbirths. Despite this, the United States ranks worse than 151 other countries in reducing stillbirth rates over the past two decades, per UNICEF. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Iowa group's 'Count the Kicks' program highlights success in stillbirth prevention efforts</h2><p>In 2004, Healthy Birth Day's founders worked with the Iowa Legislature to establish Iowa’s Stillbirth Registry to gather data on the problem. They also garnered support from then-U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin to secure CDC funding for the effort. </p><p>Five years later, they uncovered promising research from Norway that found decreased fetal movements were associated with stillbirth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. </p><p>Using these findings, the women created the Count the Kicks campaign in 2009, which encourages pregnant women to track the baby's movement daily during the third trimester. If there were any significant changes, they were told to seek medical help immediately.</p><p>Within five years, Iowa saw a 26% reduction in the state's stillbirth rate, Price said. The change was even more significant among Black women, who saw a 39% reduction between 2008 and 2012. </p><p>By bringing this programming nationwide, Price said the non-profit estimates there could be a 32% reduction in stillbirths in all 50 states.</p><p>“That’s a lot of babies, and that’s a lot of heartache spared," she said.</p></main>
