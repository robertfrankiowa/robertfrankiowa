    <main><h1>New Research Suggests These 8 Heart-Healthy Actions May Slow Aging By 6 Years</h1><p>A new study found a link between heart health and longevity.</p><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Jessica Ball, M.S., RD</strong><p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but it may feel difficult to figure out which habits are best for improving cardiovascular health. When everything from the way we think about life to the time we spend sitting can have some kind of impact on heart health, maintaining a healthy heart can seem daunting. Luckily, new research suggests that following the American Heart Association’s (AHA) guidelines may help to slow down biological aging and increase longevity. This research, which will be presented at the 2023 AHA Scientific Sessions, shows that there may be several ways to help lengthen our lives and reduce our overall risk for chronic disease.</p><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1jynW3_a_photo_of_a_woman_stretching_and_doing_yoga.jpg" alt="a photo of a woman stretching and doing yoga"><figcaption><em>Getty Images.

First, researchers found the biological or calculated ages of each participant by looking into their actual age and some blood indicators like metabolism, inflammation and organ function. Then, each participant’s heart health was scored based on behaviors and measures of Life’s Essential 8, a checklist made by the AHA for optimizing heart health. Those include:</p><ul><li>Eat a balanced diet</li><li>Be more active</li><li>Quit tobacco</li><li>Get healthy sleep</li><li>Maintain a healthy weight</li><li>Control cholesterol</li><li>Manage blood sugar</li><li>Manage blood pressure</li></ul><p>After both age and health markers were examined, the results showed that among the 6,593 adult participants (averaging 47 years old) those with better cardiovascular health  had a biological or calculated age about six years younger than their actual age. For instance, the average actual age of participants with “high” cardiovascular health was 41, but their average biological age was 36. On the other hand, the average actual age of those who had “low” cardiovascular health was 53, and their average biological age was 57. </p><p>This study took into account heart health metrics that were measured at only one point in time, so researchers may need to analyze their change over time to draw clearer conclusions on heart health and longevity. However, Dr. Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, chair of the writing group for Life’s Essential 8 still believes, “These findings help us understand the link between chronological age and biological age and how following healthy lifestyle habits can help us live longer. Everyone wants to live longer, yet more importantly, we want to live healthier longer so we can really enjoy and have a good quality of life for as many years as possible.”</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Researchers analyzed the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and found that adults with higher scores for cardiovascular health might live longer than those with lower scores. That said, the analysis was conducted based on a calculated biological age of each participant rather than actual observation of people living a longer life. However, the results strongly suggest that taking the right steps towards a healthy heart can have positive long-term health and longevity benefits.</p><p>“Greater adherence to all Life’s Essential 8 metrics and improving your cardiovascular health can slow down your body’s aging process and have a lot of benefits down the line. Reduced biologic aging is not just associated with lower risk of chronic disease such as heart disease, it is also associated with longer life and lower risk of death,” said Dr. Nour Makarem, senior author of the study and assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.</p><p>If you’re interested in strengthening your cardiovascular health, then start by checking the first box of the AHA’s Life’s Essential 8 and look into The 10 Best Diets for Better Heart Health, Ranked by Cardiologists.
