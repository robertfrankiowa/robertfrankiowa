    <main><h1>Vitamin that costs just $1.50 a day could be the next game-changer, study says</h1><p><strong>Not all solutions to medical problems cost an arm and a leg. For anyone suffering from peripheral artery disease, an over-the-counter supplement has proved effective at increasing walking endurance.</strong></p><p>Nicotinamide riboside provides a “new” – and remarkably affordable – option for those with the chronic leg disease, according to a press release from the University of Florida.</p><h2>Over-the-counter supplement that costs just $1.50 can help people with chronic leg disease</h2><p>Nicotinamide riboside is a form of vitamin B3 (aka niacin). B3 is an important nutrient that every part of your body needs in order to function effectively.</p><p>As a supplement, it can help lower cholesterol, ease arthritis, and boost brain function, according to Healthline.</p><p>Now it can add yet another string to its bow.</p><p>・<strong>MORE SUPPLEMENTS:</strong> 3 supplements tipped to ‘burn fat’ also great for your brain health, says neuroscientist</p><p>In a preliminary, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, peripheral artery disease patients who took it daily for six months increased their timed walking distance by more than 57ft, the University of Florida announced this month. It conducted the research with Northwestern University.</p><h2>Larger trials to follow</h2><p>The present trial is a signal that nicotinamide riboside could help patients with peripheral artery disease, says Leeuwenburgh, professor of physiology at the University of Florida.</p><p>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is similar to coronary artery disease. It causes a narrowing of the arteries the carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body. The most common type, according to the American Heart Association, is lower-extremity PAD, meaning blood flow doesn’t run as it should to the legs and feet.</p><p>The first symptoms people usually experience are leg pain and weakness. It often starts in the calf muscle. It’s caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, and affects more than 8.5 million Americans over the age of 40.</p><p>“We are hoping to conduct a larger follow-up trial to verify our findings,” Leeuwenburgh says, signalling that it would be premature to start self-medicating with nicotinamide riboside immediately.</p><h2>Other things you can do or take to help with bad blood circulation</h2><p>PAD is associated with diabetes and smoking. It often leads to pain while walking, and in severe cases it completely inhibits walking ability.</p><p>The first line therapy for PAD is supervised walking exercise, but not everyone who suffers from it has access to that level of care.</p><p>Other treatments besides low-level exercise – on which you can find more information on the NHS website – include:</p><p>・Stopping smoking (if you smoke)</p><p> ・Managing your diabetes properly (if you have diabetes)</p><p> ・Accessing mental wellbeing support</p><p> ・Cutting your alcohol intake</p><p> ・Managing your weight</p><p> ・Eating a balanced diet</p><p> ・Taking statins, which reduce the production of LDL cholesterol by your liver</p><p> ・Taking antihypertensives, which treats high blood pressure by blocking the actions of certain hormones.</p><p>Again, be aware that the researchers who conducted the study mentioned here do not actively encourage people to start taking nicotinamide riboside to treat peripheral artery disease. This is new research, and needs repeating.</p><p>“We need to test it on a healthy older population before we recommend healthy people take it,” Leeuwenburgh cautions.</p></main>
