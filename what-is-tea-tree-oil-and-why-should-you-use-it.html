But, what if we told you that tea tree oil might be the answer you have been seeking?</p><p>Tea tree oil, a natural remedy with countless benefits for the skin, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. And today, it is being used by everyone and their mothers. This is what you need to know.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Tea Tree Oil?</h2><p>Tea tree oil, also called melaleuca oil, originates from the Australian plant Melaleuca alternifolia. It’s a powerful essential oil known for its therapeutic properties.</p><p>Typically used topically, it’s often diluted with a carrier oil to avoid skin irritation. It is important to note that tea tree oil should only be used externally. This is due to potential toxicity if ingested orally.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oZH3l_tea_tree_oil.jpg" alt="tea tree oil"><figcaption><em>© Freepik. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><p>Tea tree oil has gained popularity worldwide as an alternative and complementary treatment in recent decades. It is now commonly used in cosmetics, topical medications, and household products.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Does it Work?</h3><p>Tea tree oil is known for its antiseptic and antimicrobial properties. It effectively combats various bacteria, viruses, and fungi, including yeasts and dermatophytes which cause skin diseases.</p><p>It is extracted from the leaves of the tea tree and is popular in home, skin, and health care products due to its diverse uses. Valued for its antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, it is primarily used topically to prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms that can lead to infections.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Can You Use It?</h3><p>Tea tree oil, a potent essential oil, can be applied directly or diluted with carriers like coconut or almond oil for topical use. It is crucial to conduct a patch test before wider application and never ingest undiluted tea tree oil due to potential toxicity. Possible topical reactions include skin irritation, rash, itching, stinging, burning, redness, or dryness. </p><p>Consult a healthcare provider if uncertain or experiencing adverse effects to ensure safe usage.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Best Ways to Use Tea Tree Oil</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. For Nails</h3><p>Onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection affecting around 10% of adults, can be effectively treated with tea tree oil, a homeopathic remedy. In a study by researchers at the University of California San Francisco, a cream containing 2% butenafine hydrochloride and 5% tea tree oil cured nail fungus in 80% of participants after 16 weeks of use.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. For Hair</h3><p>It is also commonly included in shampoos to soothe itchy scalp and enhance hair shine. Studies suggest it, along with lavender oil, may alleviate mild hirsutism in young women, and it has shown promise in treating dandruff as well.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. For Skin</h3><p>It shows promise in alleviating various skin conditions that cause itching, such as athlete’s foot and ringworm. </p><p>Research indicates it can effectively improve foot fungus, known as tinea pedis, with significant results observed in a study involving 158 participants who used a diluted tea tree oil solution for four weeks.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oZUL5_tea_tree_oil.jpg" alt="tea tree oil"><figcaption><em>© azerbaijan_stockers / Freepik. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. For Acne</h3><p>Diluted tea tree oil is beneficial in face wash for acne-prone skin. A study highlighted in the Medical Journal of Australia showed that a gel containing 5% tea tree oil was more effective than a lotion with 5% benzoyl peroxide for treating mild to moderate acne.</p><p>It being reduced both in inflamed and non-inflamed lesions offers fewer side effects. However, it worked more slowly compared to benzoyl peroxide.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Should You Use?</h2><p>Researchers have tested various doses in clinical trials for different conditions:</p><ul> <li>200 mg vaginal suppository for vaginitis</li>    <li>5% to 50% tea tree oil eyelid scrub for blepharitis</li>    <li>5% to 20% tea tree oil gel for acne</li> </ul><p>For children, it is advisable to dilute one or two drops of tea tree oil in 1 teaspoonful of olive or almond oil before applying it to the skin.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can You Take Too Much?</h3><p>It is not common if you are careful. One thing to remember is to <strong>never ingest tea tree oil</strong>. If you experience symptoms of overdose such as poor coordination, excessive sleepiness, or coma, seek immediate medical attention.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oZH3x_tea_tree_oil.jpg" alt="tea tree oil"><figcaption><em>© Freepik. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tea Tree Oil Benefits</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Helps With Athlete’s Foot</h3><p>A recent study shows that topical application of a 10% tea tree oil cream reduced symptoms of athlete’s foot compared to 1% tolnaftate, an antifungal medication, in one study. However, it did not achieve better results than a placebo for achieving a complete cure.</p><p>Recent research has explored higher concentrations of tea tree oil for treating athlete’s foot compared to a placebo.</p><p>In another study, a 50% application resulted in significant symptom improvement for 68% of participants, with 64% achieving a complete cure, which was more than double the improvement seen in the placebo group.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Reduces Inflammation</h3><p>It shows potential in reducing inflammation, possibly attributed to its high terpinen-4-ol content, known for anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Animal studies suggest terpinen-4-ol can suppress inflammation in mouth infections.</p><p>In human studies, topical application of tea tree oil demonstrated a superior reduction in swelling compared to paraffin in histamine-induced skin inflammation.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Antibacterial</h3><p>It has been used in Australia for nearly a century for healing skin conditions. Now it is applied to various ailments. Its prominent antibacterial properties are well recognized, possibly due to its ability to disrupt bacterial cell walls, though further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Effects to Look Out For</h2><p>When diluted and applied in small amounts on the skin, it is generally safe for adults. However, allergic reactions ranging from mild contact dermatitis to severe blisters and rashes can occur.</p><p>Pure tea tree oil is more likely to trigger a reaction compared to cosmetic products containing it. Research suggests up to 3.5% of people may be allergic to it.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TheHyperHive" src="IMG/BB1oZH3D_photo_of_oil.jpg" alt="photo of oil"><figcaption><em>© Freepik. Provided by TheHyperHive</em></figcaption></figure><p>It should never be swallowed due to potential serious side effects, including drowsiness, confusion, rash, ataxia (loss of muscle control), coma, and in rare cases, unexplained breast enlargement (gynecomastia) reported in a specific case. However, subsequent research shows that it is unlikely to cause hormone disorders like gynecomastia.</p><p>Will you be using this skin and hair holy grail any time soon?</p></main>
