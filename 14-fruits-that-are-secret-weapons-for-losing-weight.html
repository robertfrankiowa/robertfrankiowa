    <main><h1>14 Fruits That Are Secret Weapons for Losing Weight</h1><p>Fruits are one of the healthiest parts of a balanced diet—especially when it comes to weight loss. "Using more fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, lean meats, nuts, and beans, is a safe and healthy way to lose or maintain weight," says the CDC. "In addition, diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer and other chronic diseases." Here are key fruits that will give your weight loss efforts a major boost.</p><h2>1 Strawberries</h2><p>Low in calories and high in nutrients, just one serving of strawberries gives all of your vitamin C needs for the day. "Strawberries are loaded with flavonoids and other health-protective plant nutrients, so think of them as a super fruit," Jackie Newgent, RDN, CDN, tells TODAY. "It's recommended to eat eight strawberries a day. That counts as a serving of strawberries."</p><figure><img title="1 Strawberries" src="IMG/BB1m1UEj_1_strawberries.jpg" alt="1 Strawberries"><figcaption><em>1 Strawberries. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Blueberries</h2><p>Blueberries are another fruit that should be considered a superfood. "A one-cup serving of blueberries contains 25% of the recommended daily value for vitamin C and 4 grams of dietary fiber, but only 80 calories," Allyn Wergin, RDN, tells the Mayo Clinic Health System. "Plus, blueberries are juicy fruits, which means they contain mostly water. That high water content makes them great for weight loss or maintenance because they fill you up quickly without a lot of calories."</p><h2>3 Grapefruit</h2><p>High in vitamin C, grapefruits are delicious and very nutritious. "Grapefruits are popular with people trying to lose weight," says Johns Hopkins Health. "Grapefruit calories only measure about 104 for an entire fruit and can help you feel full and well hydrated."</p><h2>4 Apples</h2><p>Nutrient-dense apples are high in fiber and water to keep you full. "Apples have definitely earned a place in a healthy diet," Amber Sommer, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "It's a fruit that can impact your health in such positive ways."</p><h2>5 Oranges</h2><p>Oranges, including mandarins, are packed full of nutrients. "Fresh mandarins include Satsumas, Clementines and a wide variety of tangerines," says AICR Nutrition Advisor Karen Collins, MS, RDN, CDN, FAND. "Most are sweeter than other citrus fruits, and they have a bright orange, convenient to peel skin and easily divided inner sections. That makes these small beauties perfect for packing in lunches or on-the-go snacks."</p><h2>6 Pomegranate</h2><p>Pomegranates are filling, nutritious, and a great fruit to encourage weight loss. "Pomegranates are high in dietary fiber and antioxidants," Penny Kris-Etherton, the Evan Pugh University Professor of Nutritional Sciences at Penn State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, tells the American Heart Association.</p><figure><img title="6 Pomegranate" src="IMG/BB1m65S2_6_pomegranate.jpg" alt="6 Pomegranate"><figcaption><em>6 Pomegranate. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Watermelon</h2><p>Water makes up 90 percent of watermelon, making it a very hydrating and nutritious snack. Watermelon also contains fat-burning arginine. "In addition to helping the body stay hydrated, snacking on watermelon will help you feel full, so you won't have cravings between meals," Rachel Lander-Canseco, RD, tells Keck Medicine of USC.</p><h2>8 Kiwi</h2><p>Kiwi fruits are full of filling fiber, and a great source of gut-friendly probiotics. "The right balance of probiotics is important for many body processes, including fighting off illnesses and regulating your hormones," Gillian Culbertson, RD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "And we know that a balance of good bacteria can prevent digestive problems, certain infections and conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. Prebiotics are important because they are a food source for these healthy bacteria."</p><figure><img title="8 Kiwi" src="IMG/BB1m65S8_8_kiwi.jpg" alt="8 Kiwi"><figcaption><em>8 Kiwi. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Pears</h2><p>Pears are a wonderful, healthy snack for anyone trying to lose weight. "Pears are so healthy, and most people tolerate them very well," Beth Czerwony, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "They're terrific for your digestion and have other impressive health benefits. They're a perfect snack if you're craving something sweet."</p><figure><img title="9 Pears" src="IMG/BB1m5WgV_9_pears.jpg" alt="9 Pears"><figcaption><em>9 Pears. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10 Avocado</h2><p>Packed with healthy fats and fiber, avocados encourage satiety. The creamy fruit can be used to replace mayonnaise and makes a great dip. Be careful of portion sizes, as a large avocado can be anything from 200-400 calories.</p><h2>11 Bananas</h2><p>Bananas are full of fiber and make a great addition to smoothies. "They're full of nutrients and easy on the gut," registered dietitian Elyse Homan, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "Very few people have problems digesting bananas."</p><h2>12 Cherries</h2><p>Cherries are shown to help manage blood sugar levels and protect heart health. They are also a source of potassium. "High-potassium, low-sodium foods, eaten in moderation, can help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease," Carly Sedlacek, MFN, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic.</p><h2>13 Lemons</h2><p>Adding some lemon juice to your water helps with hydration—and drinking enough water will help with weight loss efforts. "We're creatures of habit," Roxanne B. Sukol, MD, MS, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "Ponder the impact of replacing your morning OJ or latte with lemon water. Not just once, but perhaps 20 times a month — and multiply that by 10 years. Your waistline will thank you."</p><h2>14 Tomatoes</h2><p>Tomatoes are low-calorie, delicious, and satiating. "An average-sized tomato has just 22 calories, and a large one has 33 calories," according to Keck Medicine of USC. "Tomatoes are also considered an appetite-suppressant "high-volume" food, which means they have high amounts of water, air and fiber."
