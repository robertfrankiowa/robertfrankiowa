    <main><h1>Men And Women Over 60 Should Avoid These Things</h1><p>If you are over the age of 60, it is time to start living your best life! You can only do that if you avoid these 12 things as much as possible. Once you do, you will be on your way toward enjoying many more fruitful, happy years ahead. Start living smarter, and we know that the best years are yet to come! </p><h2>Skipping The Doctor</h2><p>Going to the doctor is a good thing! Even if you feel completely healthy, you should keep up with your annual general practitioner visits. Your body is aging, and visiting the doctor is paramount to keep you feeling good. Never avoid the doctor, especially if you are over the age of 60.</p><h2>Self Isolation</h2><p>As you leave the workforce, you will have more time to spend alone. While it is okay to be alone sometimes, complete isolation can be detrimental to your mental and physical health. Loneliness can actually lead to depression. To avoid this, plan social activities with friends and family to stay engaged and connected.</p><figure><img title="Self Isolation" src="IMG/BB1ns52Z_self_isolation.jpg" alt="Self Isolation"><figcaption><em>Self Isolation.

However, as you get older, alcohol can have a more severe effect on your body. Alcohol can cause a rise in blood pressure, muscle weakness, a higher risk of stroke, and so much more. Plus, it can interact with many common medications among people over 60.</p><h2>Junk Food</h2><p>Junk foods, like chips, cookies, and fried snacks, have almost no nutritional value. They will fill you up but will not provide you with any benefits. Eating a healthy diet is especially important as you age, so avoiding junk food just makes sense.</p><h2>Risky Physical Activities</h2><p>While you should definitely stay active after the age of 60, you should be a little smarter about the activities you choose. Rather than trying to run your first marathon, maybe go for a little jog instead. Injuries are more common as you age, so avoiding intense physical activity is best.</p><figure><img title="Risky Physical Activities" src="IMG/BB1o0M4x_risky_physical_activities.jpg" alt="Risky Physical Activities"><figcaption><em>Risky Physical Activities.

Even after retirement, it is essential to have a regular sleep pattern for your body to function at its best! It is recommended that seniors get 7-8 hours of sleep a night.</p><h2>Ignoring Your Brain</h2><p>By 60, you have learned a lot both from studying, working and real-world experience. You are probably pretty smart! Learning and exercising your brain is essential, even in your later years. Mental engagement will keep your brain sharp. Try doing a crossword puzzle, reading a book, or memorizing a new song’s lyrics.</p><figure><img title="Ignoring Your Brain" src="IMG/BB1nrEyL_ignoring_your_brain.jpg" alt="Ignoring Your Brain"><figcaption><em>Ignoring Your Brain.

Plan a trip, visit friends in different places, or just go for a walk in a new place. Don’t let your age stop you from exploring the world.</p><figure><img title="Staying at Home" src="IMG/BB1ohNgm_staying_at_home.jpg" alt="Staying at Home"><figcaption><em>Staying at Home.

You should no longer do crunches to try to get a six pack of abs, bench press heavy weights or use pull weights that go behind your neck and back. These few exercises are examples of things that can seriously harm an aging body and may be dangerous rather than productive.</p><h2>Grapefruit</h2><p>This may sound weird, but eating grapefruits can be harmful to seniors who are on certain medications. Grapefruits can intensify medications and increase the side effects associated with those medicines. Your medication label should warn against eating grapefruits, but it may be best to just avoid this fruit altogether.</p><h2>Television</h2><p>Watching too much TV can be harmful to your health. One study found that moderate to high level viewers experienced a 7% greater decline in cognitive function when compared to those who rarely watched TV. Turn off the TV and find a new hobby to keep you busy and active.</p><h2>Ignoring Your Age</h2><p>It is great to be over 60! You likely have more time with your family and friends and less time in the office. However, you should also acknowledge your age and make sure you are safe, responsible, and smart about getting older. Consider meeting with a lawyer to make an end-of-life plan or write a will. It may be uncomfortable to think about these things, but they are important! </p></main>
