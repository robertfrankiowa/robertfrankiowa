Sadie Rigby is a social media influencer and personal trainer and is committed to encouraging a "strong, not skinny" approach to health.

"Weight training is your #1 tool for targeting fat! This is because it boosts your metabolism while forcing your body to cling to its muscle! So this means even after a weight lifting workout, you are still burning a higher amount of energy for 12-24 hours after your workout as your body repairs your muscles."</p><figure><img title="2 Lifting Weights Boosts Metabolism Even After Your Workout, She Says" src="IMG/AA1nLz1k_2_lifting_weights_boosts_metabolism_even_after_your_workout_she_says.jpg" alt="2 Lifting Weights Boosts Metabolism Even After Your Workout, She Says"><figcaption><em>2 Lifting Weights Boosts Metabolism Even After Your Workout, She Says. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 It Will Help You Target Fat Loss While Maintaining Muscle</h2><p>"Doing a good amount of weight training helps you specifically target fat loss, while maintaining lean muscle," she continues. "You could run on the treadmill and burn some calories, or you could lift weights and cause your body to burn energy and lean out all day!"</p><h2>4 Cardio, on the Other Hand, Burns Calories</h2><p>Sure, you can blast calories on the treadmill or elliptical. "Doing a lot of cardio burns calories and not necessarily fat," she points out.</p><h2>5 It Can Cause Muscle Loss</h2><p>"It can also cause loss of muscle. Losing muscle means that as you lose weight, you will continue to have a 'soft' physique, not the athletic one you were hoping for. And worse, less muscle means less metabolically active tissue, strength, bone density, and more!" she continues.</p><figure><img title="5 It Can Cause Muscle Loss" src="IMG/AA1nLrVA_5_it_can_cause_muscle_loss.jpg" alt="5 It Can Cause Muscle Loss"><figcaption><em>5 It Can Cause Muscle Loss. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Her Suggestions: Make Weight Training Your Primary Focus</h2><p>"Whatever your goals may be – fat loss, muscle gain, change in physique or just a healthy lifestyle – I would recommend making weight training your primary focus!" she concludes. "It will boost your metabolism, enhance your muscle mass, improve your balance and mobility, increase your bone density, and so much more!"</p><h2>7 There Are Lots of Benefits to Strength Training</h2><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, strength and weight training help reduce body fat, preserve and increase lean muscle mass, and burn calories more efficiently. Strength training may also help you:</p><p>— Develop strong bones</p><p>— Manage your weight</p><p>— Enhance your quality of life</p><p>— Manage chronic conditions</p><p>— Sharpen your thinking skills</p><h2>8 Add Incline if You Do Cardio</h2><p>If you are going to do cardio, like walking, add some resistance by doing so on an incline, which burns more calories than walking fast –- or even running – on a flat surface, which is why many experts suggest upping your incline. A 2013 study even found that walking on a 2 to 7 percent incline increased heart rate by almost 10 percent when compared with running on a flat surface.
