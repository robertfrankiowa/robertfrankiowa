    <main><h1>Can Nutmeg Really Improve Your Blood Pressure? Here's What the Research Says</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Barnes, RDN</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Barnes, RDN</strong><p>Nutmeg (<em>Myristica fragrans</em>) is a familiar, fragrant holiday spice available to purchase both ground and whole. It is also used in cosmetics and sold as nutmeg butter and essential oil.</p><p>Despite its name, nutmeg is not a nut. The spice is produced by grinding the seed of the <em>Myristica fragrans</em>, a native Indonesian evergreen tree.</p><p>Traditionally, nutmeg has been used in Ayurvedic (traditional Indian), traditional Chinese, and traditional Thai medicines due to its strong antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>It has been studied for its use as a remedy for pain, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal problems. However, because most of nutmeg's studies have been performed in test tubes and with animals, there is not enough evidence to predict its effects on these conditions in humans.</p><p>Learn more about the health benefits of nutmeg, dosage, potential toxicity, and more.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1o1SRj_nutmeg_and_ground_nutmeg_spice_in_wooden_spoon.jpg" alt="Nutmeg and ground nutmeg spice in wooden spoon"><figcaption><em>Getty Images / oksix. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><p><h3>Nutmeg Facts</h3><ul><li><strong>Active ingredient(s)</strong>: Nutmeg</li><li><strong>Alternate name(s)</strong>: <em>Myristica fragrans</em></li><li><strong>Legal status: </strong>Nutmeg is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a food ingredient by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </li><li><strong>Suggested dose</strong>: There is no established dose; normal use in cooking is considered safe.</li><li><strong>Safety considerations</strong>: High doses (e.g., a spoonful or more) of nutmeg can cause anticholinergic symptoms (urinary retention, dry mouth, seizure).</li></ul><h2>Benefits of Nutmeg</h2><p>Besides its use as a flavorful spice, nutmeg is traditionally thought to have many health and medicinal benefits. However, human clinical trials are limited, and more research is needed to determine its effects.</p><h3>May Help With Pain</h3><p>Using nutmeg oil externally on the body may help reduce joint pain. However, the research is very limited.</p><p>One randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial examined the clinical effects of topical nutmeg extract in people with painful diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage due to diabetes).</p><p>Seventy-four participants used either nutmeg extract, mace oil, nutmeg oil, coconut oil, methyl salicylate, menthol, or a placebo (an intentionally ineffective treatment given to people in a control group).</p><p>After four weeks, the nutmeg group showed improvement in pain, mood scores, and daily functions. However, the results were not statistically significant between the nutmeg and placebo groups. This study was small and short term; therefore, more research is needed to better evaluate its effects.</p><h3>Rich in Antioxidants</h3><p>Antioxidants can scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. Chronic oxidative stress is associated with an increased risk of disease.</p><p>Nutmeg contains antioxidants, including:</p><ul><li>Vitamins</li><li>Carotenoids (beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin)</li><li>Terpenoids</li><li>Alkaloids</li><li>Flavonoids</li><li>Lignans</li><li>Phenolic compounds</li></ul><p>Research done in test tubes has validated the antioxidant effects of nutmeg extract. However, more studies in humans are needed to determine the effects of these antioxidants.</p><h3>Contains Nutrients Involved in Regulating Blood Pressure</h3><p>Nutmeg contains micronutrients calcium and magnesium, which are important in regulating blood pressure.</p><p>Human research on the direct effect of nutmeg ingestion and blood pressure is lacking. It is highly unlikely that simply consuming nutmeg will impact your blood pressure, rather, your overall dietary patterns are more important.</p><p>However, using spices like nutmeg to flavor dishes and reduce sodium intake may contribute to improvements in blood pressure, in addition to other measures.</p><p>Supplemental nutmeg extracts enhanced libido (sex drive) in male rats.</p><p>Male rats were given 50% ethanol nutmeg extract in varying doses: 100, 250, and 500 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of weight (mg/kg) for seven days. In the rats, 500 mg/kg produced a significant change in sexual activity.</p><p>Researchers suggest this is due to nutmeg extract's effects on the central nervous system.</p><p>Unfortunately, animal studies do not always translate to human results. Studies involving humans are needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of using nutmeg for libido.</p><h2>Side Effects of Nutmeg</h2><p>Taking large amounts of nutmeg can cause toxic side effects, such as:</p><ul><li>Tachycardia(increased heartbeat)</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Agitation</li><li>Hallucinations</li></ul><p>If you believe you are experiencing nutmeg intoxication, get medical help as soon as possible.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p>Do not consume nutmeg in large quantities.</p><p>Supplemental use of nutmeg in amounts higher than what is found in foods is not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding people.</p><p>Recreational use of nutmeg to get "high" is very dangerous. Ingesting large amounts of nutmeg can achieve a high and lead to adverse effects, including nutmeg intoxication.</p><h2>Dosage: How Much Nutmeg Should I Take?</h2><p>Consuming nutmeg in normal amounts, such as those found in food, is safe.</p><p>There isn't enough evidence to suggest a safe dosage of nutmeg. It is also unclear how much you can apply safely to the skin.</p><h2>What Happens If I Consume Too Much Nutmeg?</h2><p>Nutmeg contains a substance called <em>myristicin</em>, a natural organic compound present in the essential oil of nutmeg.</p><p>Myristicin may be responsible for the psychotic effects of nutmeg. Some reports suggest toxic effects from ingesting 1–2 teaspoons of nutmeg in one sitting.</p><p>To prevent these effects, total consumption of less than 10 grams per sitting (slightly under 1.5 tablespoons of ground nutmeg) has also been suggested.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Nutmeg may interact with certain medications that are broken down by your liver and those that increase a chemical called acetylcholine. This can impact how your medications work.</p><p>Consult with your healthcare provider before taking nutmeg, especially if you also take prescription medications.</p><h2>How to Store Nutmeg</h2><p>Store nutmeg (both whole and ground) in a cool, dry place and avoid exposure to direct heat and moisture. Whole nutmeg can be grated into or onto dishes and typically produces a superior flavor than store-bought ground nutmeg. Store out of the reach of children.</p><h2>Sources & What to Look For</h2><p>You can purchase ground nutmeg in any grocery store. You can find it in the spice section, where there may be organic products available as well.</p><p>If you are considering using another form of nutmeg, such as nutmeg extract, oil, or butter, consult a registered dietitian for individualized guidance.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Nutmeg is a traditional spice used in sweet and savory dishes. It has an impressive nutritional profile.</p><p>Limited animal studies suggest the powerful plant compounds are responsible for nutmeg's potential health benefits. However, more human research is needed to support these claims and to test the safety, effectiveness, and dosage of nutmeg consumption.</p><p>While there is no harm in using nutmeg in cooking, high doses may have adverse effects. Start by using nutmeg in quantities suggested in recipes. If you'd like to explore its potential medicinal benefits, like topical use, talk to your healthcare provider.</p><p>    <strong>What does nutmeg taste like?</strong>   </p><p><p>Nutmeg has a sweet and savory flavor. It is commonly used in spice blends like pumpkin pie spice and garam masala. It is also used in recipes for baked goods, sauces, meats, vegetables, and holiday beverages like eggnog.</p><p>    <strong>Is nutmeg safe to consume?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Consuming nutmeg in usual quantities is safe. Recipes usually recommend quantities of about one-quarter teaspoon. Consuming more than a teaspoon in one sitting can cause adverse effects.</p></main></body>
