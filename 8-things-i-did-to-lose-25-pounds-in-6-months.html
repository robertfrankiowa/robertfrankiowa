"Some people do obsess too much with numbers and tend to get unbalanced and obsessed, which creates more stress and less weight loss or an unsustainable lifestyle that breaks down with binges," she says.</p><h2>10 Balance Your Training, Eat Well and Love Your Body</h2><p>"I love the balance of cardio and weight training, focusing on protein but including high-quality carbs every day. And the attitude toward life of acceptance and love for your body instead of withdrawing food and overexercising," Collingwood says.</p><figure><img title="10 Balance Your Training, Eat Well and Love Your Body" src="IMG/AA1nO9EM_10_balance_your_training_eat_well_and_love_your_body.jpg" alt="10 Balance Your Training, Eat Well and Love Your Body"><figcaption><em>10 Balance Your Training, Eat Well and Love Your Body. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>11 The Biggest Mistake? Deprivation, Says Expert</h2><p>The biggest mistake Collingwood commonly sees "is the all-or-nothing attitude," she reveals. "Some people cut out everything enjoyable, whether that is carbs or fat or alcohol or caffeine or whatever it is, and think they can never have it again.
