Provided by Flow Space</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re someone who is prone to urinary tract infections (UTIs) and thought you left the burning, pain, and frequent pee breaks behind in your youth, we have some unfortunate news for you. According to recent data from the American College Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), postmenopausal women are twice as likely to experience UTIs compared to their younger counterparts. As women transition through menopause, the body undergoes significant hormonal changes that can make them more susceptible to infections, including UTIs. </p><p>In order to understand why UTIs might be more common in older women, it's important to know exactly what UTIs are and how they're contracted. A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract - the bladder and the urethra. They are typically caused by bacteria, although fungi and viruses can also be responsible. </p><p>Common symptoms include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation during urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain, especially in women. For postmenopausal women, the risk of developing a UTI increases as estrogen levels drop - here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What changes during menopause to increase UTI risk?</h2><p>"Menopause marks the end of your ovaries’ production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Your bladder, urethra, and vagina contain estrogen receptors and your lack of estrogen makes those tissues develop changes that can increase your risk of UTI," Dr. Barbra Hanna, DO, board-certified OB/GYN and Menopause Society Certified Practitioner, tells Flow Space. "Estrogen helps the tissue in the vagina, bladder and urethra stay elastic and moist. The drop in estrogen associated with menopause allows the urethra to become less elastic, weakening its muscles."</p><p>This weakness allows bacteria to enter the urethra and move up to the bladder, increasing the risk of infection, Dr. Hanna says. She adds that estrogen also helps maintain the level of healthy bacteria that normally live in the vagina and bladder. Once your estrogen level drops, you have less healthy bacteria to help prevent infections.</p><p>"More frequent UTIs can be one part of what is called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)" says Dr. Hanna. "I like to refer to these changes as below-the-belt menopause. Your genital organs, bladder and urethra become thirsty for estrogen. This lack of estrogen causes more frequent UTIs, urinary frequency and urgency, vaginal dryness, and painful intercourse." </p><p>Recurrent UTIs are defined by three UTIs within one year, Dr. Hanna says. She adds that even just one UTI could be due to GSM during menopause. GSM affects between 27% and 84% of postmenopausal women, and can significantly impair their health, sexual function, and quality of life. It encompasses a variety of symptoms related to the genital and urinary systems, including vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, urinary urgency, urinary incontinence, and frequent and recurring UTIs. Despite its prevalence, this condition is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can menopausal women do to prevent UTIs?</h2><p>Women either transitioning to menopause or already going through it can take several steps to help prevent UTIs. Most doctors recommend vaginal estrogen, a form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that is applied directly in the vagina to fight dryness and improve your vaginal and bladder health.  In fact, a 2023 study published in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women with recurrent UTIs had a drastic reduction in UTI frequency just from using vaginal estrogen. </p><p>“Vaginal estrogen is thought to improve blood supply, which improves tone and makes the tissue healthier, making it less likely for bacteria to get into the urethra and bladder,” Dr. Mindy Goldman, MD, an OB/GYN and Chief Clinical Officer at Midi Health, tells Flow Space. “Many women know that vaginal estrogen can be helpful for dryness and painful sex, but often people don’t realize that it can also help to prevent UTIs.”</p><p>In addition to vaginal estrogen, Dr. Goldman suggests drinking a sufficient amount of water (adult women should be drinking about 11.5 cups per day), maintaining good bladder hygiene, like urinating right after sex and wiping front to back when you use the bathroom can help. All of these methods can be helpful in preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder wall, she says. </p><p>Another potential form of prophylactic treatment is low-dose antibiotics. Dr. Hanna explains that if your menopausal UTIs only occur after sex, a single dose of an antibiotic can help prevent an infection. Talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic, though. </p><p>"This prevention strategy is highly effective but usually not a gynecologist's first choice for menopause-related UTIs," says Dr. Hanna. "In addition, some women find supplementing their diet with cranberry can help prevent UTIs. However, vaginal estrogen restores your bladder health and is more effective for the prevention of menopausal UTIs." </p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
