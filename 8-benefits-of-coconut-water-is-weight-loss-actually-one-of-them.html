    <main><h1>8 Benefits of Coconut Water: Is Weight Loss Actually One of Them?</h1><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Maybe you’ve been tempted by the colorful labels or want to switch up your hydration game. In any case, you’re curious about the benefits of coconut water.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">When it comes to staying healthy and hydrated, water is key. But coconut water is popular for many reasons, one being that it’s chock-full of good-for-you nutrients.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">So what are the health benefits of coconut water, and is it a good snack for weight loss goals? Is coconut water good for you? And if so, is coconut water better than regular water? The answers to all these questions are below.</p><figure><img title="8 Benefits of Coconut Water: Is Weight Loss Actually One of Them?" src="IMG/AA11Hgdb_8_benefits_of_coconut_water_is_weight_loss_actually_one_of_them.jpg" alt="8 Benefits of Coconut Water: Is Weight Loss Actually One of Them?"><figcaption><em>8 Benefits of Coconut Water: Is Weight Loss Actually One of Them?. pilipphoto/iStock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Benefits of Coconut Water</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Buzzy marketing and popularity aside, research suggests numerous good reasons to drink the stuff. What’s even better is that coconut water benefits for females are often the same as those for men and everyone else.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Rather than having you try to decipher coconut water nutrition facts on the back of the bottle, here's a breakdown of the top benefits of coconut water.</p><h2>1. Excellent Source of Nutrients</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">One of the many benefits of coconut water is the nutrients this beverage provides.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Are there carbs in coconut water? Not to be confused with coconut milk, coconut water is rich in healthy carbohydrates — but that’s not all. It also contains electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium, which are good for your bones and muscles, among other things.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Drinking about three and a half ounces of coconut water, you’d be getting:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">3.7 grams of carbs</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">2.6 grams of sugar</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">24 milligrams of calcium</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">25 milligrams of magnesium</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">250 milligrams of potassium</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">105 milligrams of sodium</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Maybe you’re thinking all these coconut water benefits are too good to be true and are waiting for the catch. Or perhaps you’re on a weight loss journey and wondering about coconut water calories.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">While the number of coconut water calories per ounce is relatively low — roughly 45 calories for eight ounces — you’re still getting lots of necessary nutrients.</p><figure><img title="1. Excellent Source of Nutrients" src="IMG/BB1oDKgk_1_excellent_source_of_nutrients.jpg" alt="1. Excellent Source of Nutrients"><figcaption><em>1. Excellent Source of Nutrients. Dimple Bhati / iStock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2. Full of Antioxidants</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">On top of the various nutrients, coconut water also has notable antioxidant properties.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">All the research on coconut water antioxidants has been done on animals. But a more recent study found that its high-potency antioxidants helped reduce cholesterol markers in rats.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The potential antioxidant properties of coconut water may help protect you from free radicals. These unstable molecules in the environment can create oxidative stress (when there are too many free radicals and not enough antioxidants in your body), which can damage your cells and increase disease risk.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Though this possible benefit of coconut water is interesting, more research involving humans should be done before we draw any real conclusions.</p><h2>3. Great Post-Workout Drink</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The next time you come back from a long walk or a tough workout, try reaching for some coconut water to rehydrate.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Compared to sports drinks that are often higher in added sugars but contain less potassium and magnesium, coconut water is considered a natural sports drink alternative.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Thanks to coconut water magnesium, potassium and other electrolytes, small studies have found that coconut water hydration is just as effective as regular water and sports drinks.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">These minerals play several vital roles in your body, including maintaining proper fluid balance (i.e., they help you avoid dehydration and overhydration).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Coconut water on its own may not be ideal as a sports drink. But combined with salted pretzels, this post-workout snack can give you a better balance of electrolytes without the added preservatives and food colorings in many sugary sports drinks.</p><h2>4. Supports Heart Health</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Does coconut water lower blood pressure or help keep your heart healthy?</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Since coconut water potassium helps counteract the effects of sodium to reduce high blood pressure, coconut water could also help prevent heart disease — in theory.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">However, heart health is supported by other nutrients found not just in coconut water but also in a variety of foods. If you need guidance, check with your healthcare provider, a registered dietician or a nutritionist.</p><h2>5. Helps Manage Blood Sugar</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If the naturally sweet taste has you ready to look up, “how much sugar in coconut water,” you may be surprised to learn that coconut water is relatively low in sugar.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">What might be even more surprising is that coconut water may help manage blood sugar levels. Multiple studies on rats with diabetes found that coconut water helped reduce blood glucose levels.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">That said, drinking coconut water with blood sugar medication or other supplements with similar effects — like aloe, bitter melon, cinnamon or chromium — might lower blood sugar too much. If you have diabetes, check with your healthcare provider on this.</p><h2>6. Prevents Kidney Stones</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Is coconut water good for kidneys? Some studies suggest it might be good for preventing kidney stones. These are small deposits made of salt and other minerals that can be super painful to pass through the urinary tract.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Although drinking water helps prevent kidney stones, a very small study of eight people found that coconut water increased the amount of potassium, chloride and citrate in urine for those without kidney stones.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">This suggests that coconut water <i>could</i> help flush out your system and keep kidney stones from developing. But again, more research is needed.</p><h2>7. Easy Source of Rehydration</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Is coconut water hydrating? The answer is a resounding yes.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Not only does staying hydrated help with weight loss, but drinking more coconut water and plain water in general can:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Boost energy levels</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Support digestion</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Reduce joint pain</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Regulate body temperature</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Improve heart health</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Help prevent headaches</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">A drink with natural electrolyte content, coconut water is a great source of hydration, especially if you want to sip on something with more taste than plain water.</p><figure><img title="7. Easy Source of Rehydration" src="IMG/BB1oDHK6_7_easy_source_of_rehydration.jpg" alt="7. Easy Source of Rehydration"><figcaption><em>7. Easy Source of Rehydration. AzmanJaka</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8. Many Different Uses</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tempted to try this buzzy beverage? There are several uses for coconut water beyond drinking it from a bottle or box.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The clear liquid (albeit slightly murky) inside young coconuts is what makes up coconut water — and it’s different from coconut milk. You can add some to your post-workout or breakfast smoothie, use it in recipes, make popsicles or just drink coconut water straight.</p><h2>Is Coconut Water Better Than Regular Water?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says coconut water is an excellent substitute for sugary beverages like soda and fruit juice. But there’s no evidence that it’s more hydrating than regular water.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In the end, nothing beats plain water. Good ol’ H2O has zero calories, so you can (and should) drink lots of it while trying to lose weight. Not that you <i>should</i> track calories — just that plain water is an unrefuted staple for any weight loss journey.</p><h2>Is Coconut Water Bad for You?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Are there downsides to drinking coconut water? While drinking coconut water every day won’t have significant harm, you might want to weigh out the coconut water benefits and side effects.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">One thing to consider is that drinking or eating anything with a high potassium content could make your potassium levels too high. This condition is called hyperkalemia, and it can result in vomiting, nausea, chest pain and more.</p><h2>The Final Verdict on Coconut Water</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">You’ve probably seen people at the gym guzzling coconut water or noticed brightly labeled bottles lining grocery store shelves. Whatever piqued your curiosity, you want to know all the benefits of coconut water for men and women.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Here’s a rundown of what was covered:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>It’s a nutrient-rich beverage.</b> Coconut water is full of many nutrients that benefit your health in many ways, from rehydration to antioxidant content, supporting heart health and more.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>It might be a good post-workout drink for weight loss. </b>Thanks to natural sugars and electrolytes — like potassium, sodium and more — along with its relatively low-calorie content, coconut water may support weight loss.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>It’s probably better than sugary drinks like juice or soda. </b>While more research is needed on its benefits and effects, especially in terms of weight management, coconut water is a natural alternative to sugary drinks. But plain water is still your friend for weight loss.</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Drinking coconut water as part of a balanced eating plan may help with weight management, along with regular movement and weight loss medications prescribed by a healthcare professional.</p><figure><img title="The Final Verdict on Coconut Water" src="IMG/BB1oDSTo_the_final_verdict_on_coconut_water.jpg" alt="The Final Verdict on Coconut Water"><figcaption><em>The Final Verdict on Coconut Water.
