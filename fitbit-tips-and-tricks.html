    <main><h1>Fitbit tips and tricks</h1><p>Fitbit is well-known for a reason. The company's devices offer some of the best fitness tracking, and using one to monitor your health is easy. However, the latest iteration of the Fitbit app offers a vast array of tools and personalization, so it can take some time to uncover everything. The Pocket-lint team decided to pool our extensive experience with the company's smartwatches and fitness trackers to create a comprehensive guide for all things Fitbit. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Pocket-lint" src="IMG/AA1hmrlB_best_fitbit_2023_every_tracker_and_smartwatch_compared.jpg" alt="Best Fitbit 2023: Every tracker and smartwatch compared"><figcaption><em>Fitbit tips and tricks: Get more from your Inspire, Luxe, Charge, Versa and Sense trackers photo 1.

The second part deals with the technical side of things, like account settings and privacy. We sought to make it as detailed as possible, so let's dive in. </p><h2>      Tips and tricks for using the Fitbit App    </h2><p>The Fitbit app is the same across all devices and models, so you can follow these same steps whether you own a Fitbit Charge, Inspire, or any other device. The Today tab is where you'll find the most utility, so it's the first to appear when you open the app. Here's how to make the most of its power.</p><h3>How to edit what the Fitbit Today tab displays</h3><ol>          <li>            From the Today screen, tap <strong>Edit</strong>.      </li>          <li>            Tap the circle with the '<strong>X</strong>' symbol next to metrics you don't want to see.      </li>          <li>            Tap <strong>Done</strong>.      </li>      </ol><h3>How to edit the order of metrics in the Today tab</h3><ol>          <li>            From the Today screen, tap <strong>Edit</strong>.      </li>          <li>            Drag the metric tiles into the order you want them to appear.      </li>          <li>            Tap <strong>Done</strong>.      </li>      </ol><p>Five metrics will fit in the top section of the Fitbit Today tab, and you have a choice of "Steps," "Floors," "Distance," "Calories Burned" and "Active Minutes."
