    <main><h1>What Is Ketosis, and Is It Healthy?</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Allison Herries, RDN</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Allison Herries, RDN</strong><p>Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses ketone bodies, compounds produced from the breakdown of fat in the liver, as its primary energy source instead of glucose. A state of ketosis is typically induced by a significant reduction in dietary carbohydrate intake, as this lowers insulin levels and prompts your body to burn stored fat for fuel.</p><p>Ketosis, characterized by elevated levels of ketones in your blood and urine, occurs during periods of fasting and prolonged exercise, as well as eating a ketogenic diet, which has become quite popular but is not suitable for everyone.</p><p>This article examines the ins and outs of the keto diet and whether being in a state of ketosis is healthy for your body.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oSCkG_woman_slice_fresh_lemon_to_add_to_salmon_and_veggies_in_the_baking_form.jpg" alt="Woman slice fresh lemon to add to salmon and veggies in the baking form."><figcaption><em>OKrasyuk / Getty Images.

Normally, your body relies on carbohydrates for energy, which are broken down into glucose molecules and transported into your cells by insulin.</p><p>When you start drastically cutting your carb intake, your insulin levels fall. This shift triggers your body to seek alternative energy sources. It also causes your liver to convert stored fatty acids into ketone bodies, which are released into your bloodstream and taken to your brain and other tissues for energy.</p><p>Your body taps into its fat reserves, promoting fat loss while providing a steady energy supply. The transition into ketosis typically takes a few days of very low carbohydrate intake, during which your body gets used to this new metabolic state.</p><h2>Ketosis and the Ketogenic Diet</h2><p>The ketogenic, or "keto," diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to shift your body into a state of ketosis. It significantly reduces carbohydrate (carb) intake to 5% to 10% of total daily calories and increases fat intake to about 70% to 75%, with moderate protein making up the remaining 20% to 25%. For example, on a 2,000-calorie keto diet, someone might aim for a goal of 20 to 50 grams (g) of carbs per day.</p><p>On a keto diet, you're typically encouraged to avoid foods that are naturally higher in carbs, like:</p><ul><li>Grains</li><li>High-carb fruits</li><li>Legumes (e.g., beans, peas, and lentils)</li><li>Starchy vegetables (e.g., squash, carrots, potatoes, corn)</li><li>Ultra-processed foods</li><li>Dairy products</li><li>Sugar</li></ul><p>On the other hand, a keto diet usually prioritizes these types of foods:</p><ul><li>Fatty cuts of meat</li><li>Fish</li><li>Eggs</li><li>Butter</li><li>Oils</li><li>Avocados</li><li>Nuts and seeds</li><li>Low-carb vegetables like leafy greens and cruciferous varieties</li><li>Low-carb fruits like watermelon, avocados, tomatoes, and berries</li></ul><p>Adhering to these general macronutrient (carb, fat, and protein) ratios and food choices helps make it easier to maintain ketosis.</p><h2>Is the Keto Diet Healthy?</h2><p>The keto diet can offer certain health benefits, but its overall benefits depend on individual circumstances and how it is implemented.</p><p>Advocates of the keto diet highlight its effectiveness for weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and improved mental clarity. It may be particularly beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes, as it helps lower blood sugar and insulin levels. The emphasis on fats and protein may help promote satiety and reduce hunger.</p><p>However, a keto diet also poses numerous challenges and potential risks. A high intake of saturated fats can increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (considered bad cholesterol) levels and work against heart health. Restricting carbohydrates from healthy foods like fruits, grains, and legumes can also set you up for nutrient deficiencies if you don't manage your diet carefully.</p><p>The keto diet is unlikely to be sustainable long term. If you're adopting it for weight loss, you will likely lose weight initially. However, it's common to regain lost weight when returning to a regular eating pattern that includes your typical carbohydrate intake.</p><p>The keto diet may also increase your risk of dealing with issues like constipation, muscle cramps, and a phenomenon known as "keto flu" during the first few days of the diet in which people complain of headaches, fatigue, nausea, and irritability similar to the flu.</p><p>Furthermore, there's a lot of room for variability in how a keto diet is designed. Just because you're adhering to your macronutrient goals doesn't always mean a keto diet is automatically healthy or nutritionally adequate.</p><p>Anyone considering the keto diet should consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to ensure it aligns with their health needs and monitor their nutritional intake to mitigate potential risks.</p><h2>Signs Your Body Is in Ketosis</h2><p>Several signs and symptoms may indicate a metabolic shift into ketosis. Common indicators include:</p><ul><li>Bad breath, which is often described as fruity or acetone-like due to the presence of ketones such as acetone</li><li>Weight loss as your body begins to burn stored fat for energy</li><li>Keto flu, which is characterized by headaches, brain fog, and nausea</li><li>Fatigue and weakness as the body adapts to using fat and ketones instead of carbs</li><li>Reduced appetite</li><li>Increased thirst</li><li>More frequent urination due to the diuretic effect of ketosis</li></ul><p>While these symptoms can be obnoxious or uncomfortable, they're generally temporary. It's important to stay hydrated, maintain electrolyte balance, and be patient as your body adjusts.</p><h2>Health Benefits of Ketosis</h2><p>With the exception of managing epilepsy (a seizure disorder), there is limited high-level evidence supporting the health benefits of adopting a keto diet. Evidence for some of the keto diet's main uses follows.</p><h3>Epilepsy</h3><p>The keto diet is effective for epilepsy, particularly when medications don't work, because it induces a state of ketosis. The metabolic shift to using ketone bodies for energy instead of glucose can stabilize electrical activity in the brain, reducing the frequency and severity of seizures.</p><p>Ketones have anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) properties, and the diet's high-fat, low-carb composition helps maintain stable blood sugar levels. Furthermore, the ketogenic diet can boost the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a brain chemical that has inhibitory effects and helps with seizure control.</p><p>When you adopt a keto diet, you significantly reduce the amount of carbohydrates you eat. Consuming fewer carbs lowers blood sugar and insulin levels, improving insulin sensitivity and overall blood sugar control. A ketogenic diet minimizes blood sugar spikes and provides a steady energy supply by prioritizing fats and proteins over carbohydrates.</p><p>Weight loss from eating a keto diet further improves blood sugar control. However, some researchers say more studies are needed to explore the relationship between ketosis and diabetes control.</p><p>A keto diet's high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carb macronutrient composition promotes fat-burning and satiety and reduces hunger. The shift into ketosis, during which ketones from stored fat are used for energy, promotes weight loss. The keto diet also reduces levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, which decreases appetite.</p><p>However, weight loss achieved on a keto diet is typically not maintained, as this dietaary pattern isn't sustainable long term. Many people who achieve weight loss on a keto diet tend to regain it when they return to their standard eating patterns with higher amounts of carbs.</p><h2>Side Effects and Risks of Ketosis</h2><p>While adopting the keto diet may provide some benefits, it also poses several potential risks and downsides.</p><p>In the short term, a keto diet may trigger keto flu symptoms, like:</p><ul><li>Difficulty sleeping</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Headache</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Nausea</li></ul><p>Over a more extended period, the keto diet may have additional side effects and risks, such as:</p><ul><li>Potential nutritional deficiencies if it is not well-balanced</li><li>Risk of fiber deficiency due to restricted carbohydrate intake from healthy plant sources</li><li>Elevated cholesterol levels due to high saturated fat intake, which is a risk for heart disease</li><li>Increased risk of kidney stones from increased urinary calcium excretion</li><li>Challenges with sustainability and social aspects due to dietary restrictions</li></ul><p>If you're considering the keto diet, consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance on safely implementing the diet, monitor potential side effects, and ensure nutritional adequacy.</p><h2>Who Should Avoid Being in a State of Ketosis?</h2><p>A keto diet is pretty restrictive and is not a good fit for everyone. Before adopting a keto diet, it's essential to understand the potential risks and downsides. Furthermore, certain groups of people, such as the following, should practice caution as they may be at a higher risk for side effects:</p><ul><li><strong>People with certain medical conditions</strong>: If you have pancreatitis, liver disease, or disorders of fat metabolism, you may not tolerate the high fat intake required for ketosis.</li><li><strong>People with a history of eating disorders</strong>: The restrictive nature of the keto diet may be triggering for individuals who have a history of disordered eating or are prone to unhealthy food restrictions.</li><li><strong>People who are pregnant or breastfeeding</strong>: These groups of people are at a higher risk of malnutrition on restrictive diets, especially ones that restrict healthy sources of fiber and carbs and emphasize saturated fats. Practice caution due to potential nutrient deficiencies and metabolic changes that could affect maternal and fetal health.</li><li><strong>Older individuals</strong>: People of advanced age are at a higher risk of malnutrition and dehydration, which a keto diet pattern could exacerbate.</li></ul><h2>Ketosis vs. Ketoacidosis</h2><p>Ketosisand ketoacidosissound similar, and both are physiological states involving ketone production, but they are very different.</p><p>Ketosis is a natural metabolic state in which the body produces ketones from fat breakdown as an alternative energy source when carbohydrates are scarce. It occurs during fasting, prolonged exercise, or a keto diet. Ketosis is generally a controlled and non-dangerous process characterized by moderate levels of ketones in the blood and urine.</p><p>Ketoacidosis is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs primarily in people with uncontrolled diabetes (most common among people with type 1 diabetes). In ketoacidosis, the body produces excessively high levels of ketones, which causes a dangerous imbalance in blood pH levels and severe metabolic disturbances.</p><p>Ketoacidosis leads to extremely high blood sugar levels, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, with symptoms such as:</p><ul><li>Extreme thirst</li><li>Frequent urination</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Confusion</li><li>Coma, in severe cases</li></ul><h2>Can Someone With Diabetes Prevent Ketoacidosis?</h2><p>People with diabetes can prevent ketoacidosis by carefully managing their condition and following personalized guidelines to keep their blood sugar levels stable.</p><p>It's important for someone with diabetes to regularly monitor blood sugar to ensure they stay within their target range. This might also involve corrections using insulin therapy and adhering to a balanced diet that promotes stable blood sugar management.</p><p>If you have diabetes, it's essential to understand the early signs of ketoacidosis, such as increased thirst, frequent urination, nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue, and to seek medical attention promptly if you experience these symptoms. Communicate with your healthcare provider, attend regular wellness exams, and stick to your management plan.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>When your body enters a state of ketosis, it's switched from using glucose as its primary fuel to ketone bodies produced by the breakdown of stored fats.</p><p>Many people pursue ketosis by following a keto diet. While this way of eating is useful for epilepsy management and may promote temporary weight loss and improved blood sugar regulation, there's not enough high-quality evidence to recommend it as a long-term diet, as it also comes with numerous potential risks.</p><p>Everyone has unique needs and goals and a keto diet isn't right for everyone. If you're considering a keto diet, speak with a registered dietitian knowledgeable in it who can provide personalized guidance.</p></main>
