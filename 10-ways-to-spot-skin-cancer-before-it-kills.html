    <main><h1>10 Ways to Spot Skin Cancer Before It Kills</h1><p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Dermatology. But it’s also one of the more survivable cancers because it’s often spotted in its earliest stages when treatment is most effective.</p><p>Catching it early, however, requires you to know the potential signs of skin cancer and what to do if you spot any. Here are 10 strategies to use.</p><h2><b>1. Know Your Skin</b></h2><p>It's important to recognize what's normal for your skin. Depending on your genetics and your level of sun exposure, you may be more likely to develop moles and other spots that can potentially lead to skin cancers.</p><p>“You want to get a sense of how you grow your spots," explains Dr. Marc Glashofer, a board-certified dermatologist, skin cancer expert and a fellowship-trained Mohs surgeon practicing in Northern New Jersey. "We will all develop new lesions as we mature. That’s just what happens."</p><p>But anything unusual merits a closer look.</p><h2><b>2. Know What to Look For</b></h2><p>Skin cancer can take many forms, so there are different irregularities you need to watch for, says Dr. Afshin Eli Gabayan, medical director of the Beverly Hills Cancer Center in California.</p><p>He notes that the three most common types of skin cancer include:</p><ul>  <li><b>Basal cell carcinoma</b>, which may appear as "red or pinkish bumps about the size of a ball-bearing and frequently develop among those with fair complexions”</li>  <li><b>Squamous cell carcinoma</b>, which “look like warts, open sores or thick, rough patches of skin that are prone to bleeding”</li>  <li><b>Melanoma</b>, which can appear “either as a new mole that looks different than others nearby, or it may take root in an existing mole that will start growing or changing shape and/or texture”</li> </ul><p>There are other, rarer types of skin cancer, such as Merkel cell skin cancer, that may be less obvious or have different symptoms. The bottom line is: If you see something new or weird, show your doctor.</p><h2><b>3. Evaluate New Spots</b></h2><p>When you find any new spot on your skin, ask yourself:</p><ul>  <li>Is the new one different from the ones you previously had?</li>  <li>Is it a different color, shape or appearance?</li> </ul><p>For example, your moles are typically oval or round in shape and flat, tan or brown. If a new one suddenly appears as a raised, black spot with notched borders, “well, then that’s different. That’s an ‘ugly duckling,’ and that should be evaluated,” Glashofer says.</p><p>A shorthand way of remembering what signs of skin cancer to look for is to follow the ABCDE method:</p><ul>  <li><b>A: Asymmetry</b> (the two sides of a mole or spot don't match in shape)</li>  <li><b>B: Border </b>(a mole or spot has a jagged, notched or irregular border)</li>  <li><b>C: Color </b>(a mole or spot has an uneven or darker-than-typical color)</li>  <li><b>D: Diameter </b>(bigger moles and spots are of greater concern than smaller ones)</li>  <li><b>E: Evolving </b>(your mole or spot has changed recently – grown, changed color or bled, for example)</li> </ul><p>While this method applies specifically to melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinomas change frequently, too, so keep an eye on all your spots and note if any of them change.</p><h2><b>4. Know Where to Look </b></h2><p>It's more common for men to get melanomas on their backs and trunks, while women tend to get them on their legs and calves, because those areas are more likely to receive sunlight.</p><p>You should also keep a close watch on the tops of ears, which many hats don’t shade. If your hair is thinning, your scalp is less protected from the damaging rays of the sun as well.</p><h2><b>5. But Check Everywhere</b></h2><p>That said, you can develop a skin cancer on any part of the skin. Many melanomas show up in armpits, near the belly button, underneath hair, on the bottom of a foot, in folds of skin, under finger and toenails and in other places that don't get much direct light.</p><h2><b>6. Ask for Help</b></h2><p>If you’re having trouble seeing part of your skin, ask a loved one for assistance. Tell them to have a look at the parts that you can’t see, or use a mirror to get a glimpse of tough-to-monitor locations.</p><h2><b>7. Know Your Risk </b></h2><p>Some people are at higher risk of developing skin cancer. Common risk factors for skin cancer include:</p><ul>  <li>A personal or family history of skin cancer</li>  <li>Having fair skin and hair and blue or green eyes</li>  <li>A history of sunburns</li>  <li>Frequent use of tanning beds</li>  <li>Certain medical conditions, such as psoriasis, eczema, HIV/AIDs or an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis</li>  <li>Use of specific medications, such as immunosuppressant drugs, certain antibiotics and some blood pressure medications</li>  <li>Exposure to certain chemicals, including coal tar and petroleum products</li> </ul><h2><b>8. Talk to Your Doctor</b></h2><p>If you develop a new spot or mole on the skin, tell your dermatologist immediately.</p><p>Early detection is critical, emphasizes Dr. Mark Faries, co-director of the melanoma program and head of surgical oncology at The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, an affiliate of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. </p><p>“When melanoma is detected early, a simple surgical procedure cures it almost every time," he points out. "The same is true for basal and squamous cell carcinomas.”</p><h2><b>9. Make That Visit Annually</b></h2><p>Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not currently recommend routine screening for skin cancer, many doctors still recommend that patients get an annual skin check.</p><p>A skin check is a thorough visual check of the skin conducted by a dermatologist or your primary care provider to look for any unusual moles, spots, lesions or sores on the skin that could be indicative of skin cancer.</p><p>A board-certified dermatologist in particular “can diagnose and treat these efficiently and effectively,” Glashofer says, and they can monitor new spots as they emerge and track whether they change over time.</p><h2><b>10. Aim for Prevention</b></h2><p>“Prevention is still the best medicine, so avoiding sunburns and excess sun damage doesn’t mean you can’t be outside. Just be smart and protect your skin,” Faries says.</p><p>Some simple ways to reduce your risk include:</p><ul>  <li>Avoiding sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. when the sun is strongest</li>  <li>Seeking shade when outside</li>  <li>Wearing long sleeves, long pants and a wide-brimmed hat to cover exposed skin</li>  <li>Using a broad spectrum sunscreen labeled as SPF 30 or higher</li>  <li>Using enough sunscreen. Dermatologists recommend using at least an ounce to cover your whole body.</li>  <li>Reapplying sunscreen every couple of hours when you're outside. Reapply more frequently if you’re swimming, sweating or caught in the rain.</li> </ul><p>Copyright 2024 U.S. News & World Report</p></main>
