    <main><h1>From Hydration to Weight Loss: 14 Surprising Perks of Eating Cucumbers</h1><p>Cucumbers are often overlooked as just a simple salad ingredient, but this humble veggie is packed with benefits that go far beyond its crisp, refreshing taste! From keeping you hydrated to aiding in memory and weight loss, cucumbers offer a range of surprising perks that can boost your overall health. Plus, they are one of the best options for a perfect crunchy snack that’s low in calories!</p><p>Here, we’ll explore 14 reasons why you should start incorporating more cucumbers into your diet ASAP.</p><figure><img title="From Hydration to Weight Loss: 14 Surprising Perks of Eating Cucumbers" src="IMG/BB1pCiMH_from_hydration_to_weight_loss_14_surprising_perks_of_eating_cucumbers.jpg" alt="From Hydration to Weight Loss: 14 Surprising Perks of Eating Cucumbers"><figcaption><em>From Hydration to Weight Loss: 14 Surprising Perks of Eating Cucumbers.

They are a great way to keep hydrated and improve water intake on a hot day, as they are made up of 95 percent water.</p><p>Cucumbers also contain anti-inflammatory compounds to help remove body waste and reduce skin irritation. Due to their high water content, they also make for a great juice or smoothie ingredient. Some refer to the cucumber as one of nature’s most hydrating foods!</p><h2>2. They Can Help Improve Memory</h2><p>Cucumbers contain an anti-inflammatory flavonol called fisetin, which plays a significant role in brain health. Fisetin helps protect brain neurons from aging, along with the effects that come with it—including weakened memory.</p><p>And while fisetin is found in other vegetables, cucumbers, in particular, contain a more concentrated amount. Due to this, cucumbers have been cited to improve memory and help prevent memory loss.</p><h2>3. They Aid in Weight Loss</h2><p>When it comes to weight loss, calories are important. And thanks to only 16 calories per one-cup serving, cucumbers are a great food to aid in weight loss! They can fill you up without adding many calories to your day.</p><p>They also contain loads of essential vitamins to give your body a healthy dose of nutrients, which is key to losing weight in a healthy way.</p><h2>4. They Improve Digestive Health</h2><p>Any vegetable high in water content will be able to promote healthy digestion by keeping you hydrated. Cucumber skin contains insoluble fiber, which helps to add bulk to your bowel movements and aid in the clean-out process. </p><p>If you can ferment cucumbers at home to make pickles, you’re even more likely to improve your gut health! Cucumber pickles contain even more probiotic bacteria that help aid digestion. (Side note: At-home fermentation gives you more probiotic bacteria than the cucumber pickles you find in the grocery store.)</p><h2>5. They Help Reduce Blood Sugar Levels</h2><p>Cucumbers have been shown to be especially beneficial for diabetics because of their potential to lower blood sugar levels. Cucumbers have a low glycemic index, and their fiber content also slows down the digestion of carbohydrates and sugars, which can reduce blood sugar levels.</p><h2>6. They Provide Anti-Cancer Benefits</h2><p>Eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables is one of the best things you can do to stay healthy and reduce your risk of cancer.</p><p>Cucumbers contain high amounts of Cucurbitacin B (CuB), which is a naturally occurring plant compound that may have an effect on cancer cells. Specifically, it is thought to help fight liver, breast, lung, and prostate cancer.</p><h2>7. They Help Reduce Inflammation</h2><p>Inflammation in the body can lead to a whole host of problems. But thankfully, there are plenty of foods that can combat inflammation, including cucumbers. This is due to the presence of phytonutrients such as flavonoids, lignans, and triterpenes, which offer anti-inflammatory benefits.</p><figure><img title="7.

Not only does cucumber water make for a refreshing, hydrating drink, but cucumbers also have amazing skin benefits when applied topically. </p><p>Cucumbers, most popularly placed on the eyelids, apply a cooling effect to the area and ease facial swelling. Cucumbers can also be used to soothe skin irritations and ease pain from sunburn.</p><h2>9. They Diminish Bad Breath</h2><p>No one enjoys a case of bad breath! Instead of reaching for a piece of gum, you can actually grab a slice of cucumber.</p><p>Cucumbers’ high water concentration prevents dry mouth, and the crunchy texture can help eliminate odor-causing bacteria by removing food particles and plaque and stimulating saliva production.</p><h2>10. They Help Lower Blood Pressure</h2><p>High blood pressure? Say hello to another convenient health benefit of cucumbers!</p><p>Eating cucumbers regularly as part of a healthy diet may aid in lowering blood pressure, thanks to their potassium content. One large cucumber contains 442mg of potassium, an essential mineral for regulating blood pressure.</p><figure><img title="10.

Whether it’s brought on by some late-night pepperoni pizza or the joys of pregnancy, finding relief while it’s happening is a top priority. </p><p>Heartburn occurs when acid from the stomach reaches the esophagus and throat, which causes that fiery burn. Instead of reaching for a Tums, cucumbers can be a great preventative and reliever. Cucumbers contain enzymes that clean the intestine by killing bacteria and help neutralize acid in the body.</p><figure><img title="11.

But with age, they can be more difficult to come by. </p><p>Silica and vitamin C, found in cucumbers, help promote collagen production, which is essential for maintaining healthy hair and nails. Just make sure not to peel off the skin of a cucumber, which is where most of the silica and various other nutrients are found.</p><h2>13. They Can Help Combat Stress</h2><p>Cucumbers contain essential B vitamins, which may help reduce stress. Eating a healthy diet that includes cucumbers is key to managing stress levels! Not to mention, the crunchiness of this particular veggie can be a great choice for anxiety-prone times.</p><h2>14. They Improve Bone Health</h2><p>Just one cup of cucumber slices contains 22 percent of your daily value of vitamin K—a fat-soluble vitamin known for its crucial role in blood clotting and strong bone health. It is also thought to have great anti-aging benefits, including the prevention of osteoporosis and bone fractures, especially in postmenopausal women.</p><p>A diet rich in vitamin K is an effective way to improve bone density and promote healthy aging.</p></main>
