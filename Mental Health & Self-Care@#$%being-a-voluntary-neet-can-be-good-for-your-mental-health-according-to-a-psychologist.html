    <main><h1>Being a voluntary NEET can be good for your mental health, according to a psychologist</h1><p><ul class="summary-list"><li>Some young people are choosing to be NEETs to focus on mental health and values.</li><li>They see being idle as more beneficial than taking the wrong job.</li><li>The majority of people are not NEETs by choice and can suffer poor mental health as a result. </li></ul><p>Being unemployed and idle may sound like a choice nobody would make, but some young people are becoming so-called voluntary NEETs.</p><p>The acronym stands for people who are not in employment, education, or training.</p><p>And their numbers are on the rise. According to the International Labour Organization, about a fifth of people between 15 and 24 worldwide in 2023 were considered NEETs — a level not seen in nearly two decades.</p><p>NEETs are often financially supported by family and friends or by the state. However, many are still struggling with money issues and facing a host of other challenges — such as disabilities and an incomplete education — that make it difficult for them to get back into employment.</p><p>Research has found that the longer someone is out of the workforce, the more disconnected from the workforce they can become and the greater the likelihood that they will suffer mental-health problems.</p><p>However, there is a subgroup of NEETs who are out of employment voluntarily and believe that being idle isn't a bad thing.</p><p>For these NEETs, taking a step away from the workforce can have an unexpected upside, according to a psychologist.</p><h2>The rise of the voluntary NEETs</h2><p>Ryan Warner, a psychologist and business consultant, told BI there's a "huge grind culture" in the US where people think working harder yields better results.</p><p>"However, the newer generation is starting to have a different spin on how they view success," he said.</p><p>According to the American Psychological Association's 2023 survey, 77% of workers reported feeling stressed at work.</p><p>"A lot of people say, 'Hey, we'll just grind through it, get over with','" Warner said. "But some individuals are saying, 'No, I'm going to actually take the time for myself, reduce some stress, some anxiety, some depressive symptoms to protect my overall mental well-being.'"</p><p>Mental health and a work-life balance are huge priorities for many Gen Zers and they are keen to work at organizations with empathetic values and flexibility.</p><p>However, some career and recruitment specialists told BI that being a voluntary NEET could be a "big mistake" and a result of "unrealistic views" creating a "false reality" about how career opportunities come about.</p><p>They said big gaps on someone's résumé could be a red flag to potential employers, and that sometimes, fulfillment comes from putting yourself out there.</p><p>However, if you're a voluntary NEET, according to Warner, waiting a bit longer to find a job that aligns with your values and identity creates fulfillment in life and can mitigate burnout and other "long-term psychological challenges." It can also boost confidence and psychological resilience, Warner said.</p><p>"When they take that time off for themself, they're able to reevaluate their values and what's important to them, and in turn, that strengthens their identity and self-worth," Warner said. "That actually provides a sense of autonomy and control over one's life."</p><p>Warner added that, in contrast, being forced into a job that doesn't fit can lead to feelings of helplessness and a lack of agency.</p><p>Overall, it's a risk-reward analysis individuals have to make.</p><p>The reward for taking a job could be financial stability, but the risk could be feeling unfulfilled or experiencing anxiety and depression.</p><p>"A lot of individuals are recognizing the risks far outweigh the rewards, and in turn are choosing a different approach," he said.</p><h2>Most NEETs are not unemployed by choice</h2><p>It's worth saying that the vast majority of NEETs are not unemployed by choice.</p><p>As BI previously reported, some NEETs suffer from disabilities, which means they can't work. In a 2022 analysis of Census data by the San Francisco Fed, almost 40% of prime-working-age men said disability or illness was the reason they weren't in work.</p><p>Changing job demand and education levels are also factors in the rising number of NEETs. In 2016, Harvard economist Jason Furman attributed the decline of prime-age working men largely to the "reduction in the demand for unskilled labor" driven by technological change.</p><p>For this group, being a NEET can have a hugely damaging impact on mental health, according to researchers.</p><p>According to research by the Prince's Trust, NEETs are more likely than their peers to feel as if they will fail in life.</p><p>"With the right support from businesses, government and charities we can turn this around and ensure young people have the right skills and confidence to feel positive about their future work, and about their life overall," said Jonathan Townsend, UK Chief Executive of The Prince's Trust.</p><p> <p>If you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.</p></main>
