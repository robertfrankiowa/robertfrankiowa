    <main><h1>6 Simple Diet Tips to Trim Your Waist At Any Age</h1><p>A healthy diet and great exercise are the best ways to achieve a smaller waist. Slow, steady progress is the name of the game when it comes to investing in your health!</p><p>And here's the deal: what you choose to eat will make more of a difference in how your belly looks than anything else. (In other words, it's time to ditch the junk food!)</p><p>It’s imperative to eat healthy, well-balanced meals that nourish your body. And while that concept seems fairly simple, we all know it’s definitely not easy!</p><p><strong>Along with staying active, here are six diet tips that might help you adjust to a new, healthier way of eating.</strong> <strong>(And get a smaller waist in the process!)</strong></p><figure><img title="6 Simple Diet Tips to Trim Your Waist At Any Age" src="IMG/BB1oS4HR_6_simple_diet_tips_to_trim_your_waist_at_any_age.jpg" alt="6 Simple Diet Tips to Trim Your Waist At Any Age"><figcaption><em>6 Simple Diet Tips to Trim Your Waist At Any Age.

Of course, the easiest thing is often fast food. So take an hour on Saturday or Sunday and do some simple meal planning/prep.</p><p>For example:</p><ul> <li>Bake, grill, or boil a few chicken breasts.</li>  <li>Hard boil a dozen eggs.</li>  <li>Buy a few cartons of Greek yogurt.</li>  <li>Wash and chop your favorite anti-inflammatory fruits and veggies and get them into baggies for grabbing on the go.</li>  <li>If you like to cook, make a big pot of healthy chili or low-cal southwestern chicken soup and divide it into containers for the freezer.</li> </ul><p>Anything you can do to prepare in advance will reward you with results. Spending a few hours on the weekend to plan for the week ahead can transform mealtime from stressful and fattening to simple and healthy.</p><p>You can learn more with these 8 meal prepping tips for beginners.</p><figure><img title="Plan Ahead For The Week" src="IMG/BB1osiRC_plan_ahead_for_the_week.jpg" alt="Plan Ahead For The Week"><figcaption><em>Plan Ahead For The Week.

The combination keeps you balanced and satisfied. </p><p>Try to eat them together every time you eat. If you are grabbing an apple for a snack, it might surprise you to know that pairing it with a tablespoon of peanut butter is even better!</p><p>By balancing the nutrients, you might take in more calories initially, but you end up eating less in the long run, and your blood sugar will stay in balance, staving off cravings for the bad stuff.</p><p>This means you eat the good calories that get used up rather than stored in your belly. Storing less calories will help you avoid weight gain!</p><p>So, what does a well-balanced and simple meal look like? Here are some ideas for good choices:</p><ul> <li>Piece of toast made from whole grains with peanut butter and ½ a banana.</li>  <li>Protein shake with fruit or veggie mixed in.</li>  <li>Veggie sticks and hummus.</li>  <li>Full-fat Greek yogurt with berries.</li>  <li>Try our Muffin in a Minute (it’s not what you think!)</li> </ul><p>None of these are complicated, and each of them will keep you satisfied for several hours.</p><figure><img title="Eat In Balance" src="IMG/BB1oo3rg_eat_in_balance.jpg" alt="Eat In Balance"><figcaption><em>Eat In Balance.

But living in constant imbalance won't give you the best results.</p><p>Think about it: If you added up the free doughnuts at the office, slices of co-worker birthday cake, or oversized samples at the big-box store, you’d be surprised at how often you eat something that wasn't part of your original diet plan. (And don’t forget all the sips and bites you take from your kid’s plate!)</p><p>Be intentional about what you eat and, if needed, keep track for a week and write it all down as you take it in.</p><h2>Crash Diets Are Not Your Friend</h2><p>Restrictive meals and diets can cause your metabolic rate to drop. Evidence shows how hard it is for adaptive thermogenesis to begin the more you reduce your calorie intake. In reality, a tightly restrictive diet can be counterproductive.</p><p>So, how do you identify a crash diet? Any protocol that requires you to cut out a whole food group (also known as a macronutrient) or exercise excessively is worth questioning. We at Get Healthy U<em> always </em>advocate balance as the most important thing.</p><h2>Eat Bloat-Blasting Foods</h2><p>No one feels like their waist is trim and slim if they’re bloated all the time! We recommend you add foods to your diet that help with bloating and avoid the ones that make it worse. </p><p>It's helpful to steer clear of baked or processed foods. (Especially overly salty foods!)</p><p>Add lots of leafy greens, which are high in magnesium and micro-nutrients for digestion. Here’s our list of debloat foods for more ideas.</p><figure><img title="Eat Bloat-Blasting Foods" src="IMG/BB1oS7ek_eat_bloat_blasting_foods.jpg" alt="Eat Bloat-Blasting Foods"><figcaption><em>Eat Bloat-Blasting Foods.

Working toward a safe rate of losing 1 to 2 lbs per week will be much more likely to result in a permanent loss.</p><p>To make peace with slow weight loss, focus on small wins instead. Instead of “I must lose x lbs to achieve this bodyweight,” reset it to, “This week, I’m going to walk 5 times and plan my meals every day.” It's much more tangible and realistic.</p><p>Going too hard too quickly could result in burnout. You want your lifestyle adjustments to stick, along with your slimmer waist!</p></main>
