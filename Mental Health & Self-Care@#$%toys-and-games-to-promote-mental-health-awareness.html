We have several options meant to help get those conversations started or ease some anxiety around the topic.    </p><ul class="display-card-quick-links-items">                                                                                                                                                                                <li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <span data-embed-id="a8a81a1c7abb44288a7ad10e3e5aa746">   </span>                                                      <h5 class="display-card-title">                      Breaking Barriers Down                  </h5>                  Best For Starting Conversations                            See at Amazon            </li>                                                                                                                                                                                  <li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <span data-embed-id="8ff17f9dd5de4609a7ea962d67236165">   </span>                                                      <h5 class="display-card-title">                      Totem                  </h5>                  Best Feel Good Game                            See at Amazon            </li>                                                                                                                                                                                  <li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <span data-embed-id="bf7da4699f2241039069cddc9ad61b16">   </span>                                                      <h5 class="display-card-title">                      Moodles Pawster Pup Plush Dog                  </h5>                  Best Sensory Plush                            See at Amazon            </li>                                                                                                                                                                                  <li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <span data-embed-id="97920ef4f42841cd96d0f21800f6f819">   </span>                                                      <h5 class="display-card-title">                      Feelwise                  </h5>                  Best For Working Through Emotions                            See at Amazon            </li>                                                                                                                                                                                  <li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <span data-embed-id="bc188488d1594021a7a460ab994aef2d">   </span>                                                      <h5 class="display-card-title">                      Friendly Cuddle Weighted Lap Dog                  </h5>                  Best Value                            See at Amazon            </li>          </ul><h2>            Toys And Games That Promote Mental Health Awareness        </h2><span data-embed-id="0ee47aff43d64185badcbf86efd1b32b">   </span><h5 class="display-card-title ">Breaking Barriers Down</h5><p class="display-card-description">As the name suggests, Breaking Barriers Down is a block-building game that helps you share your feelings and emotions in a safe manner with a board game at the center that will help ease into conversations. </p><strong class="sub-title">Pros</strong><ul class="pro-list"><li class="icon">Explore emotions while also regulating the conversation</li><li class="icon">A decent therapeutic tool that covers several emotions</li><li class="icon">The game is familiar and easy to setup and play</li></ul><strong class="sub-title">Cons</strong><ul class="con-list"><li class="icon">Blocks may fall a bit too easily, interrupting the game</li></ul><p>          To help ease into conversations about mental health and awareness, games like Breaking Barriers Down make conversations easy to start.

In the easiest sense, if done correctly, games can help with processing emotions, allow for space and time to express feelings, and help with destressing. Some games, even some on this list, can help with knowing how to express yourself and work through situations in fun and engaging ways.   </p><h3>      What Activities Can You Do To Help With Mental Health  </h3><p>          Several activities can help, but starting small may be your best choice. Getting a proper sleeping schedule, destressing, keeping to a routine, expressing your emotions in a healthy manner, continuing mindful practices, and even more. Some games in this list can help with these, as can sensory toys.    </p><h3>      How Do Games Help With Therapy  </h3><p>          Games, whether board games or card games, can help with immersion and engagement. Where certain methods may not work, engaging and relatable options that can keep you entertained may work much better for therapy than other options. Giving you options for how to express yourself or relate to other characters is good for helping with therapy.    </p><span data-embed-id="f73b0b7f39da47b7a472ff9676c2fe8e">   </span><p class="display-card-excerpt not one">Care Bears fans prepare to stare at these amazing plushies!
