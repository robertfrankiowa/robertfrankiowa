    <main><h1>Can Oatmeal Help With Weight Loss?</h1><p><strong>EVERYONE APPROACHES BREAKFAST </strong>differently. There's the on-the-go special of a banana and protein shake. Or, the full spread of eggs, meat, pancakes, and fruit. Or, the quick and satisfying favorite: a bowl of oatmeal. </p><p>Regardless of what kind of breakfast person you are, your morning go-to needs to do a few things, especially if you're trying to lose weight. It should provide you with energy that lasts, and fill you with a good balance of nutrients. </p><p>Simple and versatile oatmeal does just that. Plus, it's simple enough to grab and go when you're on the run. Plus, with a spoonful of peanut butter, maybe some frozen berries, and possibly a sprinkle of cinnamon—it can taste as good as it is for you. Susan Schachter, M.S., R.D.N., calls it a “nourishing and versatile breakfast staple,” that can benefit your overall health. </p><p>You may have seen oatmeal included in weight loss meal plans. Can this simple, classic breakfast staple be a key to shedding some pounds? It just might be a possibility. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Can Eating Oatmeal Help You Lose Weight?</h2><p>Oatmeal has been studied for years as a potential ally in the pursuit of weight loss. </p><p>Another study, published in the <em>Journal of Nutrition </em>in 2016, reported that oatmeal's beta-glucan fiber played a role in promoting feelings of satiety and contributing to weight management. “These findings suggest that incorporating oatmeal into your breakfast routine could potentially support weight loss efforts,” says Schachter.</p><p>While the science is promising, there's no miracle food that is going to be the holy grail of weight loss. Adding oatmeal into your diet may be beneficial for weight loss since its fiber content increases satiety, potentially causing you to eat less in a day—but it all comes down to calories in verses calories out. Without a calorie deficit, weight will not change. </p><figure><img title="Arx0nt - Getty Images" src="IMG/AA1g0gwj_gettyimages_1404062530.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1404062530"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-1404062530.

Research from the<em> British Journal of Nutrition </em>shows the complex carbohydrates in oats can help improve insulin sensitivity. </p><p>As Schachter shares, oatmeal’s fiber content supports healthy digestion and may prevent constipation. In fact, dietary fiber in general — found in foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes — may help keep you regular, lower your risk of developing hemorrhoids, and provide other good-for-your-gut and digestion features.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>How to Prepare Oatmeal the Healthy Way</strong></h2><p>Not all oatmeal is created equal. Getting the most out of its health benefits means preparing it the correct way. Watch for these tips things when prepping your bowl, Schachter’s says. </p><ul><li>Opt for plain or unsweetened varieties to avoid added sugars.</li><li>Customize your oatmeal with fresh fruits, nuts, seeds, or a drizzle of natural honey for sweetness.</li><li>Choose whole rolled oats or steel-cut oats over instant oats, as they are less processed and retain more nutrients.</li><li>Be mindful of portion sizes to control calorie intake. A standard serving size is around ½-to-1 cup of cooked oatmeal.</li><li>Avoid excessively sugary toppings or sweeteners that can negate the health benefits of oatmeal, pre-made oatmeal packets with additives or high levels of sodium, and instant oatmeal varieties with added flavors and sugars.</li></ul><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
