However, no matter how much you have to do, make sure that you are making time to take care of yourself in every way possible. </p><p>This is not always easy especially if your children are young but you have to find ways to squeeze the time in so that you can be cared for. Here are some things that you need to do to ensure this. </p><h2>Involve Your Kids</h2><p>You probably think that the last people you should involve in your health care routine are your kids but this is not necessarily the case, especially when it comes to exercise. </p><p>You can exercise with your kids by going on walks with them, you can even bike ride together. When you feel beat and unmotivated the kids will try to drag you kicking and screaming out of the house so that you can get exercise, you also get to spend more time with them. It’s a win win.</p><h2>Take a Nap Time Too</h2><p>When you think about nap time you probably only think of your kids. However, enough nap times are great for adults too. </p><p>They have been proven to be very rejuvenating even if you only take fifteen minutes or half an hour for recharging. When you get up, drink a cup of tea, do some deep breathing and stretch and you’ll be surprised at how energetic you feel again. </p><p>You’ll be ready to kick start whatever activity you need to do.</p><h2>Get Help from Technology</h2><p>There are so many apps out there that can help you to keep track of your health as well. If you need to take vitamins there are apps that can help you with reminders. </p><p>There are also fitness and workout apps that you can get to help you trim down and keep your body toned.</p><p>You should also try journaling as well. There are many online journals that can help you to express your feelings. </p><p>This is great for your mental health and will help you unload your problems and burdens. Think of your journal as a friend that you can talk to whenever something is bothering you.</p><h2>Get Checked</h2><p>It’s important that you seek support whenever you need it. You can talk to your doctor about this when you go for your regular health checkups. There are certain tests that you should be doing regularly, such as a complete blood work, pap smears and even checking your hearing. If there’s something wrong with your hearing this is easy to fix and your doctor will send you to an audiologist who will explain the hearing aid fitting process.</p><p>Get Support too! You can try to get this from your partner, your family and friends. If things are spiraling downhill and you feel as if it’s out of control it’s up to you to stem tide. Don’t collapse under the pressure. Get the help you need!</p></main>
