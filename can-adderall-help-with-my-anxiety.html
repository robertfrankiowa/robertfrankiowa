This mental health condition can make it tough to focus and is characterized by feelings of impulsivity and hyperactivity.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If those things are causing you to experience anxiety, taking medication to manage your ADHD symptoms could remedy your anxiousness. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">At the same time, some people with ADHD claim they <i>experience</i> anxiety as a side effect of their medication. Which group do you believe? Well, if you look at the facts, it may be both.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Adderall is actually a combination of two things — dextroamphetamine and amphetamine. The medication is in a class of prescription drugs called central nervous system stimulants, which work by altering the amounts of certain neurotransmitters in your brain. The neurotransmitters are dopamine and norepinephrine in the case of Adderall.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">These two stimulants help people focus or control their impulses and may also be used to treat narcolepsy. But they could also stimulate anxiety.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Below, we’ve weighed how Adderall might help anxiety, how it could make it worse or <i>cause</i> anxiety, and how to manage anxiety with Adderall if you’re experiencing it.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Can Adderall Help With Anxiety?</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">First things first: There’s no evidence that Adderall helps with the treatment or management anxiety disorders. Adderall is not an anxiety medication, and neither the medical community nor the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) thinks there’s any benefit to taking this medication for the treatment of anxiety. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">So why would we even bother talking about this topic? Because Adderall may indirectly help people with anxiety avoid their triggers.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Anxiety is fairly common. According to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA), around 40 million adults in the United States have an anxiety disorder. This includes generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (or social phobia) and panic disorder, as well as related stress disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If someone is diagnosed with ADHD, the symptoms, such as forgetfulness, distractibility, and disorganization, can cause life problems that lead to feelings of anxiety, which could ultimately amplify the condition. So if your anxiety is caused by ADHD, taking taking Adderall (which is designed to help diminish the symptoms of ADHD) may help.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Does Adderall Cause Anxiety?</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">On the other hand, Adderall might make everything worse. Why? Adderall is a stimulant, so it could make those without ADHD feel jittery and nervous.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">One study on 13 healthy college students looked at how Adderall affected those who didn’t have ADHD. Overall, the researchers determined that the medication didn’t have much effect on the participants’ neurocognitive performance.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">More research needs to be conducted before anything can be said with more confidence about whether Adderall can actually increase anxiety.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The explanation lies in side effects. Yes — Adderall does come with the risk of some side effects.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The common side effects and symptoms of Adderall abuse include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Painful menstrual cramps</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Increased heart rate and blood pressure</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Nervousness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Diarrhea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Constipation</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Weight loss or loss of appetite</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dry mouth </p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Nervousness and an increased heart rate are both clear physical symptoms of anxiety, by the way. Sometimes, it’s hard to tell the difference between anxiety and the side effects of Adderall.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">For those trying to distinguish ADHD vs. anxiety, symptoms of anxiety include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Increased heart rate</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Panic attacks</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Hyperventilation</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Fatigue</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Irritability</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Nervousness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Difficulty sleeping</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Stomach issues</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">These are some of the most common anxiety symptoms, but everyone’s experience with the mental health condition is unique.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">How to Manage Anxiety From Adderall</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">As you can see, Adderall is not a solution for treating anxiety unless the anxiety is caused by symptoms of ADHD.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Both people who have and don’t have ADHD can get anxious or potentially experience an Adderall panic attack by using or misusing the medication. So while it may help anxiety in some ways, Adderall can also cause anxiety on its own.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Adderall is a serious ADHD medication. It can cause heart attacks and potentially death if misused. Plus, there’s the question of addiction: If you stop taking stimulant medications (like Adderall) quickly after a period of chronic misuse or overuse, you may experience withdrawal symptoms.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you have anxiety that’s not caused by ADHD, though, treating it with Adderall isn’t the right way to go about things. Some medical experts and mental health experts believe in three main pillars for treating anxiety (and none of them include stimulants). </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Treatment options for addressing anxiety include: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Medication</b>. Anti-anxiety medication is one way to get a handle on your anxiety. Some medications prescribed for anxiety are antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines and beta blockers. These medications can help you manage the symptoms of anxiety.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Therapy</b>. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often suggested for many mental health disorders, including anxiety. In this type of therapy, you work with a therapy provider to identify behaviors that add to your anxiety and figure out ways to stop them.</p><p>We have a guide here if you want to learn more about therapy for anxiety.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Meditation</b>. Though meditation may not be the only solution for erasing anxiety, it can be a good thing to use in conjunction with other treatments. A very small study from 2014 found that 20 minutes of meditation helped lower anxiety — most likely because it temporarily lowers brain activity.  </p></li></ul><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Adderall and Anxiety: Takeaways</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">What it boils down to is this: If you don’t have ADHD, using Adderall to treat anxiety is not the way to go. However, if you have adult ADHD that’s causing anxiety, Adderall may help by easing the symptoms of ADHD.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Here are the main takeaways for those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who are concerned about anxiety symptoms:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>There are differences between ADHD and anxiety</b>. If your anxiety is caused by your ADHD, you may notice it goes away when taking Adderall. </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Adderall is not an appropriate treatment for anxiety. </b>It is, however, a medication that can be prescribed for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>In very rare cases, Adderall can cause a heart attack </b>— especially in those who have existing heart conditions.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>If you’re dealing with anxiety outside of ADHD,</b> you’ll need to explore other treatment options, as Adderall isn’t prescribed for anxiety and can make anxiety worse.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Treatments for anxiety</b> include therapy, medication and more. </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>If you get to a point where you’d like to stop taking Adderall</b>, always speak to a medical professional first to come up with a plan for weaning yourself off it.</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you want to learn more about Adderall or discuss treatment options for anxiety, the first step is to speak with a medical professional. </p></main>
