Here are all the best tips and tricks from experts that will help you get started..

But a run just doesn't seem in the cards. </p><p>Perhaps that's because you’ve never identified as a “runner” or maybe you <em>used</em> to crush miles back in your teens, 20s, and 30s but have taken a few (okay, many) years off. Sound familiar? Then you're in the right place—because this running plan is for you.</p><p>It’s no secret that starting your running journey in adulthood can be a little overwhelming, especially as you get older. But whether you’re a running newbie looking to hit the trails, or a seasoned vet ready to make a return, your running journey is ready when you are.</p><p>“At this stage of my life, running is definitely a key part of my sense of overall well-being,” says Marybeth Cale, a 48-year-old mother of two and life coach who started running in her early 40s and now averages three to five miles a run. “The ‘runner's high’ goes far beyond the release of good-feeling hormones."</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts:</strong> Paizley Longino, CPT, CSCS, is a certified personal trainer and running coach at STRIDE Fitness. Jeff Cunningham is a certified running coach for Bare Performance Nutrition Training App.</p><p>First, know that this plan was created to help you ease into a new routine. When you're over 40, your body might move a little differently than it did at 20 or 30. So, there are some keys to success: Stick with a solid routine, make modifications when necessary, take small breaks, and slowly increase workout length if you want to hit your goals, says Paizley Longino, CPT, CSCS, a certified personal trainer and running coach at STRIDE Fitness. It's also important to add in strength training to continue to build those rediscovered lower-body muscles. </p><p>Now, read on for empowering advice from real women over 40 who have developed consistent running routines—and a serious love of the activity.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Identify your motivation and set a goal.</h2><p> Positivity and optimism go a long way when you’re getting back into the swing of things, says Logino. “Do not self-loathe or guilt yourself into working out and remember that we do this because we love our bodies and what they do, not because we are punishing ourselves,” she adds.</p><p>Next, identify your short and long-term goals, and set the tone for your training plan. “We don’t have an expiration date, so don’t try to rush back into things,” says Jeff Cunningham, a certified running coach for Bare Performance Nutrition Training App. Give yourself grace, take it slow, and adopt a patient approach.</p><p>Life is busy, but committing to running and adding an extra hour of you time is not selfish or self-indulgent, he reminds. “Self-care is health care, and physical exercise fits the bill."</p><p>Forty-six-year-old mother of two Alison Walsh just got back into running this year, and is training for the 2023 New York Marathon. “What works for me is accountability, and I have to have an end goal in mind in order to stay on task,” Walsh says. “I was not kind to my body during Covid, and now it's time to take back my fitness routine...I cannot wait for both of my sons to see me cross the finish line in 2023.” </p><h2 class="body-h2">Start small.</h2><p>Try taking it one mile at a time, and keep it manageable.</p><p>“I set out on some beautiful roads that inspire and set small achievable goals,” says Cale. “Start with just one mile, then bump it up to 1.5, then two, and keep going until you get to your ‘sweet spot’ where you really enjoy the experience and feel invigorated afterward.” </p><p>For Walsh, running is an outlet, and 30 minutes is enough to give her "that quiet time that I crave and need to keep sane." </p><h2 class="body-h2">Invest in killer running shoes and attire.</h2><p>There is nothing more motivating before a daunting workout than a cute workout set and some cool new shoes. Choose the best sneaks for your foot and fit preference, and make sure the daily trainer is comfortable and designed to withstand the running volume you expect to do, says Cunningham. “Most larger metro areas have several running specialty shops, so consult the knowledgeable staff at these stores and they can guide you into buying the right shoe for you.” Just aim to replace your running shoes once every 350 to 400 miles, because worn out shoes increase your chance of injury.</p><p>Cale says she uses new sneakers as motivation. “I track everything with the Nike Run Club which keeps me motivated as I watch my total mileage go up with each run, and when I hit a certain number of miles, I get a new pair of colorful sneakers, which is my favorite shopping to do.”</p><p>In the same vein, Longino recommends investing in running socks to avoid blisters, a comfortable sports bra to keep you supported, and if you’re running outside, bright clothing to stay visible.</p><p><h2 class="body-h2">Prioritize cross training and honor your recovery.</h2><p>You may think the more you run, the quicker you’ll improve, but this can actually lead to injury and burnout, says Cunningham. “Build volume to a manageable level before you burden yourself with starting intense, fast workouts,” he says.</p><p>And as you gradually build that cardio endurance, don’t forget to add cross training and recovery days to your weekly workouts. “A thirty-to forty-five minute session on the elliptical or swimming laps in the pool once or twice a week provides wonderful aerobic stimulus without the stress on connective tissue and bones,” says Cunningham. “Stretching and foam rolling post-runs is also recommended, so hit the hamstrings, quads, glutes, and calves.” </p><p>Yoga is also a great option for improving flexibility, strength, and stress relief, he adds.
