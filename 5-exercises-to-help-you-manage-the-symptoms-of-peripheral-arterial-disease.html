But (ironically enough) exercising your legs may actually help improve your PAD symptoms in the long run.</p><p> <p>"Exercise is a great way to alleviate the symptoms by making you stronger and improving the circulation into the muscles that are affected by the arteries," says David Nieves, DPT, co-owner of Evolving Gate Physical Therapy, a New York-based clinic that treats orthopedic and neurological disorders, including issues associated with PAD.</p><p> <p>In fact, a December 2018 study in ‌<em>Circulation</em>‌ found that regular exercise improves functioning, walking ability and overall quality of life in people with PAD.</p><p> <p>"Essentially, the whole point of any exercise routine is to increase strength and circulation," Nieves says. "And by doing this, we allow the muscles to respond in a more timely fashion to the demands imposed by your functional activities."</p><p> <p>Below, Nieves shares five exercises to help you manage your PAD symptoms and live a more functional life. Start with about 8 to 10 reps per exercise but feel free to ease off if you're not able to complete the moves with good form.</p><p class="tip"> <p>To make this move more advanced, try an air squat. Squats can improve blood flow to your lower extremities and increase quad, gluteal and hamstring strength, Nieves says. "All of these are important components in your ability to walk."</p><p class="tip"> <p>Calf raises help increase the strength and blow flow in your lower leg muscles, which are important for our ability to push off the ground when we walk. If you struggle with balance, try holding onto the back of the chair, counter, or table to better stabilize yourself, Nieves says.</p><p class="tip"> <p>Like with calf raises, you can hold onto a chair or wall to stabilize yourself while doing toe raises. This exercise helps strengthen your anterior tibialis, or shin. Weak shins can lead to shin splints and pain as well as lack of stability when walking, Nieves says.</p><h2>1. Start Slow</h2><p> <p>Don't rush through these exercises for the sake of doing them — taking your time will result in the most benefits. "Actually do them in such a way that you create some sort of response in your body," Nieves says.</p><p> <p>You'll want to perform these exercises slowly and in a deliberate manner, trying to maintain that mind-muscle connection and focusing on contracting your muscles and holding the stretch when you can.</p><h2>2. Try to Challenge Yourself</h2><p> <p>You don't want to exercise through the pain, but you should still push yourself a little. "Pain tends to indicate injury, and in the worst case, it could indicate lack of circulation in a specific muscle," Nieves says.</p><p> <p>"We don't recommend working out through the pain, but you do have to impose some sort of demand on yourself in order to achieve benefit from exercise." For the most part, you can exercise through discomfort but don't want to exercise through pain.</p><p class="warning"> <p>Before you try any new exercises, it's best to consult a medical professional. If you experience any sharp pain while you try these moves, stop what you're doing and speak with your doctor.</p><h2>3. Rest Between Sets</h2><p> <p>Always take some time to rest between sets, especially if you experience discomfort during your workout. "If you have pain and cramping, you might have pushed yourself too hard. So you're going to need a longer rest to get to the point where you don't feel that pain or cramping anymore," says Nieves.</p><p> <p>On the other hand, if you feel absolutely no effect from the exercise you did, you might want to cut down your interval of rest periods and consider increasing the amount of repetitions.</p><p> <p>"Typically, I may let somebody rests from 30 to 60 seconds between a set of exercises," Nieves says. "It all depends on your physical conditioning, what you're used to, and how hard you can push yourself."</p><h2>4. Keep a Routine</h2><p> <p>The key to reaping long-term benefits from these exercises is to keep doing them. Whether you do these exercises daily or every other day, it's important to make time in your day to fit these into your routine.</p><p> <p>But that doesn't mean you have to do all your exercises in one shot. If you can't do all the moves in a half hour, break down the routine into two 15-minute sessions. In either case, listen to your body — and if you're not sure, talk with your physical therapist or doctor about how often you should do these exercises.</p></main>
