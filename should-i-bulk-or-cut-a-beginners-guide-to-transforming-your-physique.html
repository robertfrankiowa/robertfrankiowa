But what does that mean exactly?]]] </strong>Deciding whether you should aim to pack on muscle (bulk) or focus on shedding fat (cut) is a classic fitness <strong>[[[</strong><strong>dilemma, and b</strong><strong>oth strategies can play crucial roles in achieving your fitness goals.]]]</strong></p><p><strong><<>></strong></p><p><strong>Previous note: </strong><strong>[THIS FEELS LIKE A MUCH MORE ADVANCED QUESTION TBH -- I THINK WE CAN LEAN INTO THAT! SOMETHING LIKE... IF YOU'VE BEEN LOGGING A LOT OF TIME IN THE WEIGHT ROOM, YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED YOUR FELLOW LIFTERS TALK ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE BULKING OR CUTTING. ]</strong></p><p><strong>[[[These approaches are core to bodybuilding culture, where it's common practice to cut first and then bulk to ensure muscles are visible and 'popped' for competition. This method can also benefit anyone aiming to lean out and develop more visible muscle tone, as shedding fat before building muscle can make gains more noticeable. However, experts say that choosing which phase to do first is really up to you.</strong></p><p><strong>"Honestly, there isn't really a clear-cut direction women should go," says Brian St. Pierre, RD, CSCS, director of performance nutrition at Precision Nutrition. "We used to believe it was better to get leaner first, then add muscle, but newer evidence suggests it's really personal preference. Having enough muscle is important for a whole host of things and can even make fat loss easier." That's because muscle tissue burns more calories at rest compared to fat tissue. So, the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn throughout the day, even when you're not working out. This can help create a bigger calorie deficit, which is key for effective fat loss during the cutting phase. <<>></strong></p><p><strong>But there's also this thing called body recomposition, which basically means losing body fat and building muscle at the same time. Sounds like the best of both worlds, right? </strong><strong>This balanced approach can be effective but quite challenging, as it requires even more careful management of diet and training compared to bulking and cutting separately, </strong><strong>which allow you to really zero in on your goals.</strong><strong>]]]]</strong></p><p><strong>Previous note: [LET'S EXPLAIN HERE THAT THIS IS PART OF THE VERNACULAR OF BODYBUILDING CULTURE -- CUTTING FIRST AND THEN BULKING TO ENSURE MUSCLES POPPED FOR COMPETITION. BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THERE CAN BE SOME BENEFITS TO THE STRATEGY EVEN FOR PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO BUILD MORE VISIBLE MUSCLE TONE. LET'S ALSO TEASE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO BOTH AT ONCE!]</strong></p><p>We chatted with registered dietitians and fitness pros to bring you expert insight on bulking and cutting, ensuring you kickstart either journey with confidence. This guide will help you understand the fundamentals of bulking and cutting, offering tips on how to start and succeed in both phases.</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts: </strong>Jason Machowsky, RD, CSCS, is an exercise physiologist and board-certified sports dietitian. Brian St. Pierre, RD, CSCS, is the director of performance nutrition at Precision Nutrition. Leslie Bonci, RD, is a sports dietitian based in Pittsburgh. Tiffany Ma, RD, is an NYC-based sports performance dietitian.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Bulking Vs. Cutting</h2><p>Bulking and cutting are two of the three primary phases in bodybuilding, the third being maintenance, where you aim to maintain your weight. Bulking focuses on building muscle, while cutting is geared towards reducing fat. "Bulking is about gaining lean mass, sometimes with a bit of body fat, while cutting is focused on losing weight or fat while trying to keep muscle intact," says Jason Machowsky, RD, CSCS, an exercise physiologist and board-certified sports dietitian. </p><p>Bulking involves eating more calories than you burn (a caloric surplus) to fuel muscle growth. During a bulk, expect to hit the weights hard and often, lifting heavier and performing more intense workouts. The goal is to make adequate tears in the muscle fibers through strength training and consume enough nutrients to repair those fibers, allowing muscles to rebuild bigger and stronger.</p><p>Cutting, on the other hand, is focused on leaning out. Here, you’ll eat fewer calories than you burn (a caloric deficit) to shed fat while preserving muscle mass. You'll go lighter on strength training sessions (without abandoning them altogether!) and incorporate plenty of moderate to intense cardio. </p><p class="body-text"><em>Comparison at a glance:</em></p><h4 class="body-h4">Bulking</h4><ul><li>Goal: Gain muscle</li><li>Caloric Intake: Surplus</li><li>Training: Heavy lifting</li><li>Risks: Gaining excess fat </li></ul><h4 class="body-h4">Cutting</h4><ul><li>Goal: Lose fat</li><li>Caloric Intake: Deficit (but the point isn't to deprive yourself)</li><li>Training: Combo of strength training and cardio</li><li>Risks: Losing muscle mass</li></ul><h2 class="body-h2">How To Determine If You Should Bulk Or Cut</h2><p><strong>[[[The answer depends on where you are now and where you want to go in relation to your body composition and fitness goals. "Whether to bulk first or cut first is truly up to you," says St. Pierre.]]]</strong></p><p><em>Consider the following to help you determine which approach is right for you: </em></p><ol><li><strong>Assess your body composition</strong>: <strong>[[[[</strong><strong>Understanding your current <strong>body fat percentage </strong>can provide insight into whether you might benefit more from bulking or cutting, <strong>but remember, the decision isn't about hitting a specific number—it's about aligning with your goals.</strong> </strong><strong>Methods like circumference measurements or body fat scales can help gauge where you stand, track changes over time, and inform decisions about your fitness and nutrition.]]] </strong> </li><li> <strong>Know your goals: [[[</strong><strong>If your goal is to get stronger, bulking is ideal as it fuels intense workouts needed to stimulate muscle growth, according to Tiffany Ma, RD, an NYC-based sports performance dietitian. On the other hand, cutting is all about reducing body fat while preserving the muscle you currently have.]]]]</strong></li><li><strong>Consult a professional</strong>: Working with a registered dietitian to create a personalized plan is the best way to safely and effectively get results. </li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">How To Start A Bulk</h2><p>How you approach a bulk depends on how much muscle you want to add and your experience level. (Newbies might actually have an advantage here—more on that below.)</p><p>Starting a bulk can feel overwhelming, but breaking it down into manageable steps makes the process easier and more effective. </p><p><strong>Figure out your base calories:</strong> To determine the number of calories your body needs to consume daily to maintain its current weight (aka 'maintenance calories'), you can use an online calculator that factors in your age, sex, weight, height, and activity level (the National Institute of Health’s Body Weight Planner is popular with experts). Then, add five to 10% more, depending on how much muscle you're looking to gain and your fitness level.</p><p>"Women new to resistance training can gain muscle rapidly—up to eight to 12 pounds in a year—requiring a calorie surplus of around ten percent above maintenance," says St. Pierre. "Advanced lifters, however, might only gain two to three pounds per year, needing just a five percent surplus. Larger surpluses mostly lead to body fat gain, as there's a limit to how fast muscle can be added." </p><p><strong>Choose nutrient-dense foods: </strong>"Quality matters just as much as quantity," says Leslie Bonci, RD, a sports dietitian based in Pittsburgh. Opt for lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, foods that provide the necessary macro- and micronutrients for muscle growth and overall health.</p><p><strong>Prioritize protein:</strong> Bonci recommends focusing on increasing protein intake, which is crucial for muscle repair and growth. Aim for a daily protein intake of 1.6 to two grams per kilogram of body weight to support muscle gain (about 109 to 136 grams for a 150-pound female). "Make sure that breakfast and snacks contain protein. I would also suggest having a high-protein snack before bed," she says. </p><p><strong>Focus on strength training:</strong> Machowsky says to train your major muscle groups—chest, back, legs, arms, shoulders, and core—three to four times a week. You can do full-body workouts or split sessions, but if you go with splits, you'll probably need to work out four days a week to cover everything, while full-body sessions can be done in three days, according to Machowsky. Try to give yourself 24 hours of recovery between full-body sessions and 48 hours between split sessions working the same muscle group. </p><p>Do plenty of heavy compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, which work multiple muscle groups at once, but also include other exercises like pushups, dumbbell rows, overhead presses, lunges, step-ups, core work, biceps curls, and triceps dips. Regularly mix up your rep counts and load to avoid overtraining. </p><p><strong>Monitor your progress:</strong> Weigh yourself regularly and aim to gain 0.25 to 0.5 percent of your body weight each week (an average of 0.5 pounds per week for a 150-pound female). If your weight isn’t increasing after a couple of weeks, try adding 100 to 200 calories more per day. </p><p><strong>Stay consistent and patient: </strong>"Consistency and patience are key," says Machowsky. This phase can last from one month to over six months, depending on your goals. Avoid the temptation to rush the process, as this can lead to unhealthy eating habits and potential setbacks. </p><h2 class="body-h2">How To Start A Cut</h2><p>Cutting is all about precision—trimming fat without losing your hard-earned muscle. Here are some guidelines for getting started: </p><p><strong><strong>Determine your caloric needs:</strong></strong> Like with bulking, you'll need to figure out your maintenance calories. From here, you'll subtract a certain amount of calories each day to stimulate fat loss, which also will be unique to you. “I don't like to decrease more than 350 to 400 calories a day, but it also is based upon what one's current intake is,” says Bonci. “Going too low in calories will result in fatigue and inability to train as well as increased risk of injury.” Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist if you're unsure where to start. Research suggests that a conservative approach is best for maintaining muscle, aiming to lose 0.5 to one percent of your body weight per week (0.75 to 1.5 pounds for a 150-pound female). </p><p><strong>Focus on fiber and protein</strong>: "The challenge with cutting is about finding foods that fill you up without piling on the calories," says Bonci. As with bulking, experts recommend keeping your protein intake high—between 1.6 to two grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. “Choose nutrient-dense foods high in fiber, protein, and fluid, [such as] lean proteins, veggies, fruit, soups, dairy if you tolerate it, and moderate portions of starches and healthy fats," says Machowsky. </p><p><strong>Engage in cardio <em>and</em> strength training</strong>: Plan to strength train two to three times a week, focusing on compound movements with moderate weights, doing three to four sets of eight to 12 reps. Incorporate cardio two to four times weekly, mixing low-intensity steady state (like walking) with high-intensity interval training. Ensure at least one rest day per week and prioritize sleep to support your recovery and feel your best. </p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Strength training, which you need for building muscle, has its own fat-burning perks (which is one of a few reasons why you shouldn't omit it from your exercise routine when cutting). It not only burns calories while you're working out but also for a few hours afterward because of the muscle repair process. This is often called the "afterburn effect" or excess post-exercise oxygen consumption.</p><p><strong>Track your progress and maintain consistency</strong>: Stick to your cutting program just long enough to reach your goals to help preserve muscle throughout the process, according to Machowsky. Being in a cut phase can be tough, but it's important to remember that going slow and steady is the safest, most effective approach. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Can you bulk and cut simultaneously?</h3><p>Body recomposition—gaining muscle and losing fat at the same time—is tough but doable, especially for beginners. "Aim for a smaller calorie deficit with plenty of protein and resistance training," says St. Pierre. <strong>[[[This approach requires careful attention to nutrition and exercise to provide your body with the right tools to build muscle while also burning fat. Progress is typically slower than with traditional bulking and cutting phases, but body recomp can be a balanced way to achieve both muscle gain and fat loss in the long run.]]]</strong></p><h3 class="body-h3">Can you cut without losing muscle?</h3><p>Absolutely, with the right approach. "Consuming at least 1.6 grams [of protein] per kilogram of body weight per day is key to muscle preservation," says Ma. Resistance training regularly, at least twice per week, is also imperative to prevent muscle loss. And remember, patience is key. Moderate calorie deficits are the best approach to successful weight loss, so avoid drastic cuts. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Foods To Eat </h3><p><em>When <strong>bulking</strong>, Bonci recommends eating plenty of lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Lean proteins</strong>: Chicken, fish, tofu</li><li><strong>Complex carbs</strong>: Oats, brown rice, sweet potatoes</li><li><strong>Healthy fats</strong>: Avocado, nuts, olive oil</li><li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong>: Bananas, berries, leafy greens</li></ul><p class="body-tip"><strong>Pro tip: </strong>To hit your calorie goals before you finish the day, Bonci advises opting for a high protein snack at night. (Check out some of our favorite high-protein snacks for inspo.)</p><p class="body-text"><em>When <strong>cutting</strong>, Bonci suggests opting for lean proteins, high-fiber vegetables, and complex carbs in smaller portions.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Lean proteins</strong>: Emphasize lean animal protein such as chicken and lean beef, as well as protein isolates (such as protein powders) to keep calories low.</li><li><strong>Non-starchy vegetables</strong>: Dark leafy greens like spinach and kale and veggies with a high water content, such as cucumbers and zucchini, are your friends.</li><li><strong>Complex carbs</strong>: Opt for smaller portions of whole grains and starchy vegetables such as rice, quinoa, and potatoes.</li><li><strong>Healthy fats</strong>: Use in moderation, such as measured servings of nut butter and oil for cooking.</li></ul><p><em>When <strong>bulking</strong>, limit low-calorie foods, fat-free foods, and snacks high in sugar, says Bonci.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Low-calorie foods</strong>: Focus on nutrient-dense options.</li><li><strong>Highly processed foods</strong>: Limit intake to avoid excess fat gain. </li></ul><p><em>When <strong>cutting</strong>, Bonci says to avoid high-calorie beverages, fried foods, and high-calorie snacks.</em></p><ul><li><strong>High-calorie beverages</strong>: Steer clear of alcohol and sugary drinks. </li><li><strong>Refined carbs</strong>: Minimize intake of pasta, bread, crackers, chips, and cookies.</li><li><strong>Fried foods</strong>: Avoid to keep calorie intake in check.</li></ul><p class="body-tip"><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Understanding <em>when</em> to bulk or cut and <em>how</em> to start each phase is crucial for achieving your physique goals. However, whether you choose to bulk or cut, the key is to have a personalized plan and stay consistent. </p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
