The 72-year-old lives close by and often walks in the park in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld. Today, she and her wheeled companion have something special planned: for the first time, they're going to walker-yoga.</p><p>"This isn't a competitive sport," instructor Kathrin Fritzsche clarifies at the beginning of the session. She then encourages the seniors – the oldest being 97 years old – to close their eyes, feel within themselves, breathe, and rotate their joints. Those with a walker sit on it, while those who can walk without one simply sit on a chair.</p><h2>Walker-yoga: the initiator wants to motivate participants to move</h2><p>Yoga, as Fritzsche says, who has been running a studio in Köthen for a year and a half, is not only good for one hour a week but a real help around the clock. Standing is not just standing, and head posture is not just head posture. </p><p>Fritzsche wants to motivate participants to move, raise awareness of a conscious body posture, and also ensure they make contacts outside their living environment.</p><p>Her parents, whose motivation and movement decreased over the years, gave her the idea of ​​walker-yoga, the yoga instructor recounts.</p><h2>Stay fit in old age – with social contacts and movement</h2><p>When we get old, the psyche and expectations of age have a strong influence on our physical health, says Aline Schönenberg of the Medical Faculty at the University of Halle. "Those who assume that aging can be influenced and are proactive, recover better from diseases, for example – studies show this," says the psychologist, who primarily researches well-being in old age.</p><p>To stay fit, it's best to do what you enjoy, recommends the expert. "I can register for a sudoku group, but if I don't really like it, at the end of the day I won't go. If I prefer to go for a coffee with the nice neighbors, be in the city, have fresh air, that's just as good because I really do it – and that helps body and psyche."</p><p>In general, it's good to do something together with other people. "Combined with sport – even better, two birds with one stone." It is important that the activities match what the body and psyche are still capable of</p><h2>People between 60 and 75 years are the least lonely</h2><p>Social interaction is therefore crucial to stay healthy for a long time. If it is missing, people can become lonely. Loneliness is also a common topic in nursing care, says Frieder Weigmann from Diakonie Mitteldeutschland. </p><p>Many people describe the problem of their children living far away, but also when they live in the next big city but the parents can no longer drive and live in rural areas.</p><p>But it is not primarily or even only the elderly who are lonely, emphasizes Schönenberg. "On the contrary: people over 65 are more active than ever." High rates of loneliness are rather seen in youth, around the age of 40 – then the rate initially decreases again. </p><p>"Among people starting in their early 60s to about mid-70s, the rates are among the lowest of all. And then in old age, when health deteriorates, it becomes more difficult."</p><h2>Senior: "I feel like I'm 30, I'm up for anything"</h2><p>With offers for older people, there is, for example, a clear difference between the city and the countryside in Thuringia or southern Saxony-Anhalt, says Schönenberg. "There are many contact points in the city. In the countryside, these offers are still missing in many places." </p><p>Diakonie also does not have good structural answers to loneliness, according to Weigmann's assessment. "But where it succeeds in creating spaces and times for encounters, it is gratefully received."</p><p>Retiree Fanneß finishes the yoga session on and at her walker in Köthen with a broad grin on her face. "I also do sports at home in front of the television, but this is really great.</p><p>In old age, you have to move, otherwise you get stiff," says the 72-year-old, who has lived in Köthen for 50 years. "I feel like I'm 30, I'm up for anything," she says, grinning and saying goodbye. "See you next time."</p></main>
