    <main><h1>Health Benefits of Beetroot Powder</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Barnes, RDN</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Barnes, RDN</strong><p>Beetroot powder is made with dried and powdered beetroot (<em>Beta vulgaris </em>L.). Beetroot, or beets, is a reddish-purple root vegetable.</p><p>Researchers believe beetroot powder has anti-inflammatory benefits and contains antioxidants and other compounds that may benefit heart health. Beetroot can improve your athletic performance when taken regularly as a supplement or a pure powder.</p><p>Beetroot may also help your body recover after intense physical activity. Beetroot is commonly consumed as a juice, cooked vegetable, supplement, or powder.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1pEd4j_health_benefits_of_beetroot_powder.jpg" alt="Health Benefits of Beetroot Powder"><figcaption><em>Design by Health / Getty Images.

Beets are high in nitric oxide, a molecule of nitrate compounds that increases the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your muscles.</p><p>Nitric oxide also helps your cells move glucose (blood sugar) through your body. Glucose is part of what gives your body the energy for physical activity.</p><p>A small study found that consuming beetroot supplements increased muscular endurance. Beetroot supplements are a fast way to consume the powder in capsule form. In males, beetroot supplements slowed the process of losing muscular strength.</p><p>Another study found that consuming beetroot powder before beginning resistance training increased the length of time participants could work out before feeling muscle fatigue.</p><p>Beetroot powder also contains betalain, a pigment with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Betalains and other antioxidants found in beetroot powder may help with a faster recovery after exercising.</p><p>Research also found that beetroot supplements accelerated muscle recovery after exercise and reduced muscle soreness. However, more research is needed on the relationship between muscle recovery and beetroot powder.</p><h2>Could Improve Heart Health</h2><p>Beetroot is high in compounds that help to improve blood flow, but more research is needed to determine its health benefits in powder form. Compounds like nitric oxide move glucose and expand blood vessels to promote blood flow.</p><p>Research shows that beetroot juice may be more effective than beetroot powder in reducing blood pressure levels. According to the study, decreased blood pressure from beetroot juice may be less likely for people with diabetes.</p><p>Hypertension (high blood pressure) hardens and narrows your arteries. This makes it difficult for your arteries to transport blood. Having extremely high blood pressure puts you at increased risk for heart failure. Heart failure and stroke are two of the top causes of death in the United States.</p><h2>Contains Antioxidants</h2><p>All forms of beetroot, including beetroot powder, contain antioxidants that can strengthen your immune system. However, more research is needed to know how much the antioxidants in beetroot powder affect your immune health. Beetroot powder contains antioxidant compounds like betalains, phenolic acids, and flavonoids.</p><p>All of the antioxidants in beets help support your overall health. Researchers believe betelain may help prevent kidney damage and certain types of cancer. Adding more antioxidant-rich foods and products into your diet may reduce cellular damage and lower your risk of developing health conditions.</p><h2>Nutrition</h2><p>Beetroot powder is low in calories and full of vitamins and minerals.</p><p>A two-tablespoon (tbsp) serving of beetroot powder has the following nutrients:</p><ul><li><strong>Calories:</strong> 59.94 cal</li><li><strong>Fat:</strong> 0 grams (g)</li><li><strong>Carbs: </strong>12 g</li><li><strong>Fiber:</strong> 5.99 g</li><li><strong>Protein:</strong> 0 g</li><li><strong>Potassium:</strong> 473.4 milligrams (mg), or 10% of the Daily Value (DV)</li><li><strong>Iron:</strong> 1.08 mg, or 6% of the DV</li></ul><p>Beetroot powder contains nutrients like calcium, potassium, and iron. Potassium is a key compound for blood pressure regulation. In the U.S., many processed foods are high in sodium. Potassium relaxes blood vessels and promotes blood pressure stability by helping the body get rid of sodium through waste.</p><p>Antioxidants like vitamin C help with immune support, collagen (connective tissue) production, and iron absorption. Fiber in beetroot supports gut health and regular bowel movements.</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>Beetroot powder is generally safe when consumed as suggested. However, ingesting too much beetroot powder can potentially increase your risk for lung cancer and other health conditions. Researchers advise not taking doses of beetroot powder higher than recommended on the product's packaging.</p><p>It's important to consider what kind of beetroot powder you purchase. Some brands of beetroot powder may contain high levels of heavy metals like cadmium. High levels of cadmium are toxic to the human body. How the beetroot in your beetroot powder is grown can influence the amount of cadmium in it.</p><p>You are more likely to absorb the nutrients from beetroots as a vegetable before it becomes a powder. In the process of becoming a powder, there is a chance that beetroot can lose some of its original nutrients from its raw form. However, more research is needed to know more about the risks of beetroot powder over time.</p><h2>Tips for Consumption</h2><p>One benefit of beetroot powder is that it can be consumed in several ways. For example, you can mix beetroot powder as a juice or an ingredient in a recipe. Many people mix beetroot powder into smoothies or water with lemon juice. Beetroot powder can also be added to oatmeal and chia pudding.</p><p>You can follow a recipe with beetroot powderâ€”for example, homemade protein bars and energy balls. Beetroot powder is an additive in baked goods like breads, cakes, and cookies for red coloring. Beetroot is sometimes used in sauces.</p><p>Beetroot is also added to some processed meats. Beetroot powder increases the nitrate content in meats. In processed meats like sausages, beetroot powder increases the vibrancy of the color. It can also alter the flavor of a meat dish.</p><p>Beetroot powder is commonly added to homemade salad dressings and pancakes for coloring and to alter the flavor.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Beetroot powder may help you work out longer and feel less of a burn afterward. It is full of vitamins and nutrients like potassium and iron that prevent inflammation in your body. However, some nutrients in raw beetroots may become less effective when consumed as a supplement.</p><p>Consult your healthcare provider before adding beetroot powder to your vitamin routine or diet.</p></main>
