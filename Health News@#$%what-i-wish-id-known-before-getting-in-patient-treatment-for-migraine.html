    <main><h1>What I Wish I'd Known Before Getting In-Patient Treatment for Migraine</h1><p>In the weeks leading up to my first migraine in-patient treatments, I considered backing out a dozen times. I knew I was a good candidate for hospitalization, as my chronic migraine disorder was debilitating and unresponsive to meds, and it kept me from working. But, nonetheless, signing up for a hospital stay felt extreme and scary.</p><p>If you’re feeling nervous about hospital treatments, you’re not alone. I’ve been there; it’s impossible to feel completely ready for something like this.</p><p>But a little planning can go a long way in making in-patient migraine treatments less scary. So, if you think you're considering in-patient treatment, let me help you prepare. These are some things I learned during my stays at a migraine in-patient clinic that I think you should know.</p><h3>An IV Is Involved, Most Likely in Your Arm</h3><p>This is, perhaps, obvious. But if you, like me, don’t have much experience with IVs, there are some things you should keep in mind.</p><p>One is that the experience of getting an IV ranges from uncomfortable to terrible, but there are things you can do to avoid the terrible end of the spectrum. Consider, for starters, telling your doctor ahead of time if you’re nervous about getting an IV. Work with them to make a plan for your IV placement, then augment the plan with your own pizzazz. My IV placement plan, for example, involves taking anxiety meds and listening to a funny podcast.</p><p>Another thing about IVs is that the tube gets caught on basically everything. Wear short sleeves and experiment with different sleeping arrangements, especially if you’re a side sleeper.</p><h2>Migraines Not Going Away? How to Break Out of a Rut</h2><p>One last point, if the IV infusion pump starts beeping loudly and insistently, don’t freak out! This happens often. It’s a finicky, overly dramatic device. More often than not, it beeps because the medication bags need to be replaced. NBD.</p><h3>Hospitals Like Making Rules</h3><p>I was surprised by the long list of “don'ts” — some of them reasonable, some less so — that awaited me when I arrived for my first in-patient treatment. I was frustrated that I wasn’t allowed to go to the hospital’s courtyard to get fresh air or walk from the bed to the bathroom without supervision. I wasn’t even allowed to shower! These rules were especially difficult when I came for treatment during the pandemic, because it felt like quarantine to the max.</p><p>Though the rules will vary depending on your exact treatment and hospital, it’s best to expect the unexpected and to make a game plan to sustain your mental health. Mine involves dry shampoo and a stationary exercise pedaler.</p><p>Also, remind yourself that the rules are all temporary. When I’m done with treatment and back home, peeing in solitude feels extra special and I take really long showers to make up for all those I missed.</p><h3>Side Effects, Side Effects, Side Effects</h3><p>These, like the rules, are temporary but unfortunate. I have a low threshold for tolerating side effects like nausea and muscle aches, so I communicate early and often when I’m uncomfortable. I also supplement what the hospital can provide with things from home, like my shiatsu massager, ginger drops, and cuddly Dory the fish.</p><h3>The Food Will Probably Suck</h3><p>But there is hope, because many hospitals have a patient refrigerator. If you can confirm there’s a fridge, bring a large variety of fresh snacks and (nonalcoholic) drinks! If there is no fridge, pack your favorite nonperishable snacks. And still include drinks because your nurse can bring you ice and cups.</p><p>Also, I accidentally discovered that my hospital has unlimited frozen lemonade. No one told me this at first. So it’s important to find a cool nurse early on and ask them about the premier culinary options. And while you’re at it, ask what meals on the menu should be avoided!</p><p>If you’re picky about the quality of your coffee, as I am, I’ve found only two ways to improve the abysmal caffeine situation: have a friend deliver better coffee from the outside world, or pack a Keurig machine. If tea is more your thing, then why not bring an electric kettle and your favorite tea bags?</p><p>But whatever you do, don’t drink the mysterious dark liquid in those plastic hospital mugs!</p><p>In-patient treatment is hard, but for many people (including me), it’s worth it. I wish it could be easier to go through a hospital admission, but having a shot at feeling better is something worth celebrating.</p><p>So, plan something special during your hospital stay, like watching your favorite movie or spending time with a friend. One thing I did to celebrate, for example, was ask my nurse for a margarita. She returned with apple juice and an alcohol wipe. Bottoms up!</p><h2>From In-Patient to Out-Patient</h2><p>After getting three in-patient treatments, I’ve since shifted my treatment plan to involve more out-patient infusions. Though I cannot receive the same medications out-patient as in-patient, I’ve found that regular out-patient infusions can help the effects of my in-patient treatments last longer.</p><p>I may or may not return to the hospital; I am working closely with my neurologist to determine the best next steps. But if I do, I’ll have a game plan for making it the most fun hospital stay possible. Because if I need to get in-patient treatments for migraine, I might as well try to have a good time while getting them!  </p></main>
