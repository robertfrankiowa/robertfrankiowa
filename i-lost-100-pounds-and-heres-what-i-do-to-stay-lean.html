    <main><h1>I Lost 100 Pounds and Here’s What I Do to Stay Lean</h1><p>TikTok influencer Meg lost 100 pounds in a year after taking semaglutide medication Wegovy and has kept it off since then. "POV you lost 108 pounds in a year because you used a GLP-1 medication as a tool but prioritized a complete lifestyle change first," reads the text over a before-and-after video. Meg lost half the weight she needed before taking Wegovy and kept those good habits up throughout her journey. Here's what Meg does to stay lean, fit, and happy since losing weight.</p><h2>1 Taking the Stairs</h2><p>Meg says she started taking the stairs everywhere. "I used to take the lazy way out," she says. "Take the elevator even if it was one or two floors up." Now she makes it a point to park on the top level or as furthest away from where she is walking to.</p><h2>2 Stop Drinking Your Calories</h2><p>Meg stopped drinking high-calorie beverages from her favorite coffee chains. "I wasn't even paying attention to how many calories and how much sugar was actually in these drinks," she says. Meg makes the point that these drinks provide no nutritional benefits.</p><h2>3 Prioritize Sleep</h2><p>Meg says getting 7 hours of sleep a night was crucial for her weight loss. "It's so important to be getting an adequate amount of sleep each night," she says. "This was something that I changed drastically at the start of my weight loss."</p><figure><img title="3 Prioritize Sleep" src="IMG/BB1nfSFa_3_prioritize_sleep.jpg" alt="3 Prioritize Sleep"><figcaption><em>3 Prioritize Sleep. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 30 Minutes of Movement</h2><p>Meg got at least 30 minutes of movement in every day. She makes the point that it doesn't matter what that movement is, so long as it keeps you active. "Lifting weights, swimming, dancing, even walking," she says.</p><h2>5 Lots of Walking</h2><p>Meg says walking and a calorie deficit were instrumental in helping to torch fat at the beginning of her weight loss journey. "Do something you enjoy, whatever that may be," she says. "That's all I did for the first several months."</p><h2>6 Calorie Deficit</h2><p>Meg started counting calories after realizing she was eating far more than she thought on a daily basis. "It's not a bad thing to know how many calories you are putting into your body," she says. "And what the nutritional value is of the food you're consuming."

She also enjoys coffee, and good quality dark chocolate for a pick-me-up. "This was a caramel brulee latte," she captioned a picture.</p><figure><img title="7 Lots of Water" src="IMG/BB1nfUZG_7_lots_of_water.jpg" alt="7 Lots of Water"><figcaption><em>7 Lots of Water. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Incline Walking</h2><p>Meg did incline walking for the first six months of her weight loss. "Started at low incline 3 mph for 30 minutes and progressively worked up to the 12/3/30 workout," she says. "I started my weight loss journey in the middle of winter in 2022 so I only had the treadmill haha but I love walking outside the rest of the year when I can!!" she commented on her post.</p><h2>9 Healthy Diet</h2><p>Meg would eat a diet that encouraged muscle gain and weight maintenance. A typical breakfast would be a cranberry bar, fruit smoothie, and yogurt. She would eat cottage cheese and fruit for a pre-workout snack.</p><figure><img title="9 Healthy Diet" src="IMG/BB1nfOz2_9_healthy_diet.jpg" alt="9 Healthy Diet"><figcaption><em>9 Healthy Diet. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10 Lots of Protein</h2><p>Meg eats plenty of protein, like her salmon bowl, which contains 23 grams of protein. She also enjoys a chicken fajita bowl, which has 25 grams of protein. "Dark chocolate always," she says of her favorite treat.</p><h2>11 Lifting Weights</h2><p>Meg avoided loose skin issues by weight training. "Lifting weights!!! I lift several times a week and stay consistent with it as well as cardio/ running," she commented on a post.</p><figure><img title="11 Lifting Weights" src="IMG/BB1mFRxR_11_lifting_weights.jpg" alt="11 Lifting Weights"><figcaption><em>11 Lifting Weights. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>12 Getting Strong, Not Skinny</h2><p>Meg shifted her focus from weight loss to being as strong as possible. She does resistance training at the gym, frequently posting videos of herself doing pull-ups and push-ups, as well as gymnastic-style headstands. "When your mindset shifts from 'I just want to be skinny' to 'I want to be strong,'" she captioned a video.</p><h2>13 Turkey Pot Roast</h2><p>Turkey pot roast is one of Meg's favorite high-protein, low-calorie dinners. One serving contains 36 grams of protein and 420 calories. Most importantly, it's delicious, Meg says.</p><h2>14 Dumbbell Exercises</h2><p>Meg has an incredibly toned and strong physique and shared her arm exercises on TikTok. "For my girls who are scared of the weight section, I got you! Here's some beginner dumbbell exercises to try," reads the text on a video.</p><h2>15 Be Consistent</h2><p>For Meg, consistency and discipline were key to her weight loss and is crucial for her maintenance. "Most days I am not [motivated]," she commented on a video. "Just gotta build the habit and it's all about having discipline and delayed gratification."
