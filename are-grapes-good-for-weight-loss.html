    <main><h1>Are Grapes Good for Weight Loss?</h1><p>     <strong>Medically reviewed by Aviv Joshua, MS</strong><p>If you're working toward reaching a healthy weight, grapes can be a tasty, satisfying, and nutritious part of your daily routine. Grapes are low-calorie and low-fat. They make a great snack and can also brighten up a meal. Here's a look at why grapes are a good food to consider for weight loss.</p><p>This article will discuss the nutrients in grapes, the research on grapes and weight loss, how to enjoy grapes as part of a healthy diet, and any drawbacks.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1hjZWw_a_person_holds_a_cluster_of_grapes_from_a_vine.jpg" alt="A person holds a cluster of grapes from a vine"><figcaption><em>lechatnoir / Getty Images.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), here's a list of what you'll be getting in about 150 grams (g) of grapes, which equals about 1 cup:</p><ul><li>Calories: 104</li><li>Water: 122 g</li><li>Carbohydrates: 27 g</li><li>Protein: 1 g</li><li>Fat: 0.2 g</li><li>Fiber: 1.4 g</li></ul><p>The carbohydrates (carbs) are largely simple sugars, which are easily used up by the body. Grapes have virtually no fat, and the high water content and fiber can help keep you feeling full. Grapes also contain important nutrients, including potassium, manganese, vitamin K, vitamin C, and some B vitamins.</p><p>Grapes contain antioxidants, including resveratrol, a compound that may help protect against serious health conditions like heart disease and cancer, as well as having potential anti-obesity properties.</p><p>A healthy daily portion of fruit includes about 1.5 to 2 cups for females and up to 2.5 cups for males, according to the USDA.</p><h2>Research on Grapes and Weight Loss</h2><p>Fresh fruit, including grapes, has many health benefits, but can they help you lose weight beyond lowering your calorie intake? Here's a look at what researchers have found.</p><p>In 2016, a study noted that although grapes and other fruits contain sugar (which is often thought to contribute to weight gain), they have been associated with weight loss.</p><p>A review of studies published in 2020 looked at resveratrol to determine if it aided weight loss by helping the body absorb sugar and boosting metabolism. The review concluded that it did help reduce weight and increase lean mass.</p><p>However, another review published the following year found no evidence that resveratrol helped with obesity. In 2022, one other assessment concluded that there was a lack of evidence of weight loss.</p><p>While the research on grapes and weight loss is inconclusive, there is also interest in other health benefits. One study using mice noted that grapes reduced fat deposits in the liver and may even extend life span. Similar benefits to humans have not been shown to date.</p><h2>Using Grapes for Weight Loss</h2><p>Grapes are one of the most popular fruits sold in the United States. Tasty, satisfying, and low-calorie, grapes are also a whole, unprocessed food with no additives and contain only natural sugars.</p><p>Grapes can play a role in helping you reach your target daily calorie goal. Keep in mind that cutting too far back on calories can harm your health, so talk to your healthcare provider about establishing a healthy calorie goal for weight loss.</p><p>Ideas for using grapes as part of a weight-loss eating plan include:</p><ul><li>Grapes are a great take-along snack for school, work, or after a workout.</li><li>Pop grapes in the freezer to enjoy as a snack with a little added crunch.</li><li>Sliced or cut-up grapes can be a delicious addition to a light chicken salad.</li><li>Saute grapes and serve them with poached fish.</li><li>Toss grapes in wild rice and add a small amount of chopped walnuts to combine nutty and sweet flavors.</li><li>Grapes can be a good substitute for sugary treats like cookies or ice cream when you're feeling the need for some sweetness.</li></ul><p><p>All grapes are good for you and have about the same amount of calories. They can all be useful in a weight loss program. When it comes to health benefits, there is some evidence that red grapes have more antioxidants and may help reduce fat more than white (green) grapes.</p><h2>Are There Drawbacks to Grapes for Weight Loss?</h2><p>On balance, grapes are a healthy choice, with few downsides. However, too much of most foods can undo your weight loss plans, so keep portion control in mind. If you log your meals and snacks, make sure you record how many grapes you've eaten.</p><p>Grapes are relatively high in sugar, so people who are concerned about sugar intake should keep that in mind. If you have diabetes, fruit (including grapes) is considered a part of a healthy diet due to its low glycemic load (the effect of food on the rise in blood sugar after consuming it).</p><p>If you eat too many grapes, you may notice problems with digestion, such as gassiness that can lead to diarrhea or an upset stomach.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>When it comes to weight loss, grapes are a good go-to when you're cutting back on calories. They are satisfying and sweet and contain important nutrients. Research on whether grapes or the resveratrol in grapes can help with weight loss is mixed and inconclusive.</p><p>As long as you don't overdo it—a cup or two of grapes are plenty—they can be part of your eating plan for weight loss.</p>
