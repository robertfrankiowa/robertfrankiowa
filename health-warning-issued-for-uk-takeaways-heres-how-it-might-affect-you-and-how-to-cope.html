Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whether consumed as a hangover cure or an addition to a Netflix marathon, takeaways are an integral part of many peoples’ weekends.</p><p>However, a new study has issued a health warning for those who partake in this quintessentially British tradition, as the findings suggest that some takeaway meals contain more calories than the recommended daily intake.</p><p>According to the NHS Eatwell Guide, women should consume around 2,000 calories a day and men around 2,500, while the UK Government’s One You campaign encourages adults to eat 400 calories at breakfast and 600 for both lunch and dinner, with the remainder covered by snacks.</p><p>Now, new research shows that six out of 10 takeaway meals exceed the 600-calorie suggestion for lunch and dinner, a trend that the study’s authors have warned could be fuelling the UK’s obesity crisis.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1oHxV5_some_takeaway_meals_contain_more_calories_than_daily_limit_uk_study_finds_httpswwwtheguardiancomsocietyar.jpg" alt="Some takeaway meals contain more calories than daily limit, UK study finds https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/22/some-takeaway-meals-more-calories-daily-limit-uk-study Source: Nesta?s analysis of Kantar?s Out of Home service data, 1st April 2021 to 31st December 2021.

Some contain almost all the recommended daily allowance, contributing to 7.5% of all calories bought across the UK.</p><p>Elsewhere, the stats show that approximately 60% of the UK population purchase out of home (meaning any prepared food or drink bought for immediate consumption and includes things like meal deal sandwiches) at least once a week. Around 7 million (11%) use it once a day.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to cope with navigating calories</strong></h2><p>When calorie labels were first introduced to menus in 2022, critics argued that the measure could trigger people with eating disorders (who have an obsession with the number of calories they consume) and foster warped and disordered relationships with food and calories.</p><p>‘[Labelling calories on menus] might mean that someone with an eating disorder will try to divide their portion, skip it altogether, or spend the rest of the day worrying about their overall calorie intake,’ James Davis, a psychologist, personal trainer and sports nutritionist, previously told Metro.co.uk.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1oHjMx_neon_sign_in_blackpool.jpg" alt="Neon Sign in Blackpool"><figcaption><em>Six out of 10 takeaways exceed the calorie suggestion for lunch and dinner (Picture: Getty Images).
