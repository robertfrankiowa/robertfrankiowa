Protect Your Mental Health While Being Pregnant </h3><p>Pregnancy can be stressful for many women, but there are tools you can use to make it more manageable.</p><p>One of the best wellness tips for expecting moms we could offer is to understand that the course of pregnancy can be challenging for anyone and that you are not alone in this journey. </p><p>A pregnancy tracker can be a valuable tool in managing and understanding these challenges, providing reassurance and encouraging a greater sense of control over your journey.</p><p>If you’re experiencing depression or anxiety during pregnancy, it’s recommended to seek professional support. Cognitive behavioral therapy can specifically improve depression and anxiety in women. </p><p>Mindfulness, exercise, and learning a new skill can also improve your mental health. It’s essential to build healthy habits throughout pregnancy. Don’t forget the power of a great social network, as friends and family can drastically improve your mental health.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pay Attention to Your Bodies Changing Nutritional Needs</h3><p>It is important when expecting, to pay attention to your diet to guarantee enough nutrient support for your baby while growing and your body changing and adapting to new needs. It's also important to keep healthy habits such as regular exercise, and try to maintain a healthy weight,</p><p>It’s usually recommended to gain around 25 to 35 pounds of weight during pregnancy, but these can vary depending on the weight you’re starting at. It's quite common to gain 1 to 4 pounds in the first 3 months and 2 to 4 pounds from month 4 until delivery. If possible, try to get to a healthy weight before getting pregnant and maintain this weight throughout your journey.</p><p>Once you are pregnant, it is usually recommended to follow these eating patterns: </p><ul> <li>no extra calories in the first trimester;</li>    <li>340 more calories a day in the second trimester;</li>    <li>and 450 more calories a day in the third trimester. </li> </ul><p>You’ll often have to increase your intake of vitamins and minerals when pregnant. These extra calories should come from nutritious sources, such as fruits, vegetables and meat (but, it’s okay to cheat on your diet occasionally). </p><p>Also, the amount of extra calories and nutrients might need to be tailored to your specific needs, in case you have a condition such as diabetes or are carrying twins.  </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Know What You Should and Shouldn’t Eat or Drink</h3><p>Nutrition is a very important part of pregnancy, both before and after you’re pregnant. It’s important to speak to your health care provider about your dietary needs when pregnant, as they can offer advice and can recommend you to a dietitian. </p><p>With that said, there are many wellness tips for expecting moms that are well researched. We’re going to look at a few that have to deal with what you should or shouldn’t put in your body: </p><ul> <li>Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk products or non-dairy milk, and healthy sources of protein. Avoid fish-based proteins, like bigeye tuna, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, or tilefish that are high in mercury.</li>    <li>Breakfast: If you have stomach issues in the morning, munch on some whole grain crackers in the morning and eat oatmeal or fruit before the afternoon.</li>    <li>Eat high-fiber foods to prevent constipation, and eat small meals throughout the day to avoid heartburn. Avoid anything spicy that could irritate your stomach.</li>    <li>Don't drink alcohol. Research has shown that there is no safe amount during pregnancy. </li>    <li>Limit caffeine to 200mg a day, which is equivalent to a 12-ounce cup of coffee.</li>    <li>Avoid raw food, such as eggs, fish and undercooked meat or poultry. These can contain a bacteria called listeria, which can make you and your baby sick. </li> </ul><p>If you change your diet before you get pregnant, it will be easier for you to keep it up when you’re with child. Do your best to wean off drugs and alcohol before you are trying to conceive. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Try Get Enough Sleep Before and After the Baby is Born</h3><p>One of the most important wellness tips for expecting  moms to follow is getting enough sleep, but no one said that was easy. Sleep challenges can begin as early as the first trimester, as moms may feel drowsier due to a spike in progesterone. The second trimester should be much easier for most.</p><p>But by the third trimester, the increased pressure on the diaphragm and your growing belly can cause heartburn, restless leg syndrome, and increased urinary frequency, all of which can  impact your sleep. </p><p>Rhinitis (the inflammation of the inner part of the nose, causing nose stuffiness) may also occur, which could be associated with snoring . It’s important to note that you’re at a higher risk of developing sleep issues if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. </p><p>If you’re interested in getting enough sleep before and after the baby is born, you’ll need to make some lifestyle changes. It’s recommended that you do the following things:</p><ul> <li>Go to bed at the same time every single night.</li>    <li>Ensure your bedroom is dark and quiet.</li>    <li>Remove electronic devices from the bedroom.</li>    <li>Avoid caffeine, and large meals before bed.</li>    <li>Be physically active to fall asleep easier at night.</li> </ul><p>Many of the things that positively affect your sleep also impact other aspects of your life. But if you make a few lifestyle changes before the baby comes, you could be able to minimize some of the sleep issues that could impact your pregnancy. However, some pregnancies are more taxing on the body than others, so there’s no guarantee you’ll always be able to have a good sleep. </p><p>According to American activity guidelines, women should stay active during pregnancy. Exercise can help you and your baby gain an appropriate amount of weight, reduce bloating, leg cramps, and backaches, and reduce your risk for gestational diabetes and postpartum depression. </p><p>The majority of women will be able to practice the same amount of exercise as they did before they were pregnant. This means aiming for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. Some exercise wellness tips for expecting  moms you should try include walking or chair aerobics, drinking fluids before, during, and after exercise, and wearing comfortable clothing.</p><p>However, some pregnancy complications such as being at risk of a premature birth or vaginal bleeding, might mean you will need to get a rest from exercise. Talk to your doctor about it to make sure you are all good to work out. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">In Conclusion… </h2><p>As an expecting mom, taking care of your well-being is essential for both you and your baby. By implementing these wellness tips into your daily routine, you can create a healthier and more joyful pregnancy experience.
