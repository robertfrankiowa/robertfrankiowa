    <main><h1>NYC Makes America’s Biggest Mental Health Rebound Post-Pandemic: How Does Your City Stack Up?</h1><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">New York City residents are feeling happy and healthy post-pandemic, according to a study conducted by Hims & Hers. New Yorkers reported the biggest positive gains in mental health since having to shelter in place during COVID-19. Half of surveyed New Yorkers (50%) say their mental health has “changed for the better” since the pandemic. This compares with just 38% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 65 overall who reported the same. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Backing up a better New York state of mind: 70% of surveyed New Yorkers graded their current mental health as an A+ (39%) or an A (31%) as compared to 59% of Americans, only one-quarter (25%) of whom gave their mental health top marks (A+).</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Top Cities With the Most Improvements in Mental Health Since the Pandemic</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">Following up New York City, Hims & Hers found that residents in other surveyed cities reported significant improvements in mental health since the pandemic: Omaha, NE (49%); Albuquerque, NM (45%); Minneapolis, MN (44%); Atlanta, GA (44%); and Des Moines, IA (43%).</p><figure><img title="Hims/Hers" src="IMG/BB1pcSyN_top_cities_with_the_most_improvements_in_mental_health_since_the_pandemic.jpg" alt="Top Cities With the Most Improvements in Mental Health Since the Pandemic"><figcaption><em>Top Cities With the Most Improvements in Mental Health Since the Pandemic. Hims/Hers</em></figcaption></figure><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Not all cities fared as well. Only 21% of residents surveyed in San Antonio reported that their mental health changed for the better since lockdown, and Tampa, FL; Nashville, TN; Columbus, OH; and Detroit, MI rounded out the bottom of the list (see below for full city rankings).</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">New York City by the Numbers: A Closer Look at the Top City With Post-Pandemic Mental Health Improvements </h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">For New Yorkers who were surveyed, improved mental wellness was accompanied by several significant upticks in their health and life overall, suggesting a positive correlation between mental wellness and life satisfaction. Specifically:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">54% say their priorities are more in-check vs. 39% of Americans overall</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">46% say their physical health is better vs. 35% of Americans overall</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">44% say their love life has seen a boost vs. 35% of Americans overall</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">"Mental health isn't just about how we feel emotionally," says Jessica Yu, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and Senior Director of Patient Experience at Hims and Hers. "It's also connected to our physical appearance and self-confidence, our relationships and intimate satisfaction, and how we show up at work and school."</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Surveyed New Yorkers are also reporting more improvements in their physical appearance. 45% say their body image has improved since the start of the pandemic and 40% say they look better. This compares with 36% and 35% of Americans, respectively.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">New Yorkers’ intimate lives have seen less of an improvement than other cities, however, with only 32% of surveyed New Yorkers saying intimacy is better than before the pandemic, compared to 34% of the country. The New Yorkers surveyed by Hims & Hers also reported that their job satisfaction pre-and-post-pandemic was about the same as the rest of the country. </p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Mental Health by Demographic: The Generations, Genders, and Other Groups With the Biggest Post-Pandemic Mental Health Improvements</h2><p class="sc-d8f3501e-2 kXXWqu">Beyond mental health improvements by metropolitan areas, there were notable differences in post-pandemic mental health by demographic. Let’s take a look at surveyed respondents by other demographics who indicated their mental health “changed for the better” since the pandemic.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Specifically:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Generation Z saw the biggest improvement in mental health post-pandemic. 44% of Gen Zs said their mental health changed for the better since the start of the pandemic. (This contrasts previous research that found Gen Z self-reported more mental health negative outcomes compared to other generations.) 42% of Millennials said their mental health had improved post-pandemic, and only 28% of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Men saw more mental health improvements post-pandemic than women, and dads saw more improvement than moms. 42% of men reported that their mental health had changed for the better since the pandemic vs. 34% of women, and 46% of dads said the same vs. just 36% of moms.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">LGBTQ+ respondents and People of Color (POC) both report their mental health is better as compared to their non-LGBTQ+ and non-POC counterparts. 44% of LGBTQ+ respondents say their mental health has improved vs. 37% of non-LGBTQ+ respondents; and 41% of POC respondents say they’ve seen improvements vs. 33% of non-POC respondents. </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Married couples saw a bigger lift in mental health than singles or non-married couples in monogamous relationships. 41% of married respondents said their mental health had changed for the better as compared to 36% of both singles and couples in monogamous relationships.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Millennial men fared the best. 47% of Millennial men said their mental health has changed for the better as compared to 35% of Millennial women and 38% of Americans overall. </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Gen X and Boomer women reported the least improvement in their mental health. Only 26% of women 45+ said their mental health had improved post-pandemic as compared to 38% of the total American population.</p></li></ul><figure><img title="Hims/Hers" src="IMG/BB1pcQvi_cities_with_the_most_improved_mental_health_since_the_pandemic.jpg" alt="Cities with the Most Improved Mental Health Since the Pandemic"><figcaption><em>Cities with the Most Improved Mental Health Since the Pandemic.
