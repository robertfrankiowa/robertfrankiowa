    <main><h1>What's Driving the ‘World's Fastest-Growing' Brain Disease'?</h1><p><em>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, with an estimated one million people currently living with PD in the United States. PD results from decreased dopamine production, mainly affecting movement, including disturbances in gait and tremors affecting mostly males over age 60.</em></p><p>Recent research suggests that a once-common cleaning solvent could be responsible for an increase in PD cases. This article discusses the science behind the chemical connection to Parkinson’s disease.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes Parkinson’s disease?</h2><p><strong>The exact cause of PD is unclear,</strong> and there is currently no known cure. Possible causes include genetic mutations, which account for about 15%, and a history of head trauma. Environmental factors like smoking, pollution, and pesticides are also associated risk factors for developing PD. However, do these risk factors explain why cases have more than doubled in the last 30 years?</p><p>A recent study published in the March 2023 issue of the<em> Journal of Parkinson’s Disease</em> hypothesizes another possible cause. Dr. Ray Dorsey is the study’s lead investigator and professor of neurology at the University of Rochester.</p><p>Dr. Dorsey led his team to review research in several studies involving prolonged exposure to a chemical called tetrachloroethylene (TCE). TCE was once a widely used chemical in the manufacturing industry, dry cleaning, and military bases, increasing the number of people possibly exposed. The research identified seven studies that led to the suggestion of a connection to PD.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is TCE?</h2><p>TCE is a <strong>colorless liquid</strong> first developed in 1864 in Germany, but commercial production did not begin in the United States until 1925. It had a number of uses, including the following:</p><ul>   <li><strong>Anesthetic.</strong> From the 1930s until the 1970s, hospitals used it as an inhaled anesthetic. However, its use decreased into the 1960s after a growing number of reported cases of cardiac side effects. This eventually led to the FDA banning TCE as an inhaled anesthetic in 1977.</li>   <li><strong>Dry-cleaning</strong><strong>. </strong>TCE was also used as a dry-cleaning solvent until the 1950s. Later, another chemical called perchloroethylene (PCE) replaced it. However, PCE can also chemically transform into TCE in certain environmental conditions. This placed people who worked in the dry-cleaning industry at a greater risk of exposure for many years.</li>   <li><strong>Food production.</strong> TCE was also utilized in the food production industry. TCE was the chemical used to extract fat and oil from foods, and in the process of decaffeinating coffee.</li>   <li><strong>Degreaser.</strong> In the manufacturing industry, TCE was and is still used as a degreaser of metal parts in factories, and as a cleaner for rocket-fueled engines. As a result, it has affected certain industrialized regions, aerospace facilities, and some military bases in the United States.</li>  </ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">TCE exposure</h3><p>You don’t just need to work directly with TCE to have an exposure risk. Someone can be exposed to TCE by <strong>inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. </strong>Unfortunately, with the moving of spent TCE to storage tanks, some areas eventually had TCE seep into the soil, groundwater, and drinking water in areas close to the source. TCE can also evaporate from ground contamination, possibly polluting the air.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Possible TCE-containing products</h3><p>TCE <strong>became a "Group 1" carcinogen in 2014</strong> because of its linkage to several types of cancer, including prostate, kidney, liver, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition, data suggests TCE may contribute to disease in most organs in the body and carries an increased risk of miscarriages and congenital abnormalities with exposure.</p><p>Some current products containing TCE may include:</p><ul>   <li>Typewriter correction fluid</li>   <li>Adhesives</li>   <li>Cleaning wipes</li>   <li>Lubricants</li>   <li>Gun cleaners</li>  </ul><ul>   <li>Paint removers</li>   <li>Refrigerants</li>   <li>Pesticides</li>   <li>Paints and wood finishes</li>  </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">TCE & Parkinson’s connection</h2><p>Making an absolute connection between TCE and PD is challenging since the <strong>exposure and emergence of PD symptoms often take several years. </strong>Since such an extended period exists, other causative factors, such as additional chemicals, solvents, or other environmental elements, may also lead to the PD diagnosis.</p><p>Findings show contact, inhalation, or ingestion of TCE from contaminated air, soil, or water, causes damage at the cellular level. Animal studies showed this damage can cause neuroinflammation and loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra area of the brain. TCE may also affect the production of alpha-synuclein proteins responsible for causing Lewy body formation. These alterations in the brain are all part of the physiological changes associated with Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>The suggestion of possible links between PD and TCE <strong>originates as far back as 1969. </strong>One case study reviewed a man who worked with the solvent for over 33 years and was later diagnosed with PD.</p><p>There was also a case series of three industrial workers diagnosed with PD after over 25 years of contact and inhalation exposure. In that case series, an additional 14 workers did not have a PD diagnosis, but all <strong>noted some Parkinson’s-like symptoms,</strong> such as slowed motor movements.</p><p>They also reviewed a large, population-based study published in 2012 that studied 99 pairs of twins and their occupational or hobby exposure to TCE. This research concluded that there was a <strong>500% increased risk of developing PD</strong> with prolonged exposure to TCE compared to the twin without exposure.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will TCE be banned?</h2><p>While this research has compelling evidence of a possible connection between TCE and PD, the <strong>results still need to be more conclusive, </strong>requiring more research. Scientists in the United States are calling for the banning of TCE use.</p><p>More countries, the European Union (EU), and some US states are<strong> banning the use of TCE based on its significant health impact</strong> on PD, cancer, and other diseases. The containment, cleaning, and monitoring of TCE levels of several contaminated sites in the US may limit or prevent further exposure.</p><p>Finally, most people with PD <strong>do not have a clear risk factor connection</strong> - therefore, the healthcare provider must conduct a comprehensive health history. This history must include an environmental, lifestyle, and occupational history, including any possible chemical exposures.</p><p>If, indeed, prolonged TCE exposure is the cause for the sharp increase in cases over the past 30 years, this underscores that PD could potentially be a preventable disease. However, we need more research to confirm and take action to avert a further rise in Parkinson's disease.</p><p><em>Written by  Kimberley Valentine, BSN, RN</em>.</p></main>
