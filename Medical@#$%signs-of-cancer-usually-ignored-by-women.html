    <main><h1>Signs of cancer usually ignored by women</h1><h2>Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding and/or Discharge</h2><p>Women typically don't have one cycle that is exactly the same as the next. Abnormal bleeding, however, is a common symptom of all gynecologic cancers except for vulvar cancer. This could be heavier bleeding than normal and for a longer period. This could also be spotting, both in the amount of blood and also duration. This is especially important for menopausal women, as bleeding after you've already gone through menopause is a symptom of something going on, be it cancer or something else. (2)<br><br>Changes to your vaginal discharge can also be a sign of gynecologic cancer. Watery discharge, heavy discharge, or discharge that is pale, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling could all be signs of cancer. If you are at all concerned about your vaginal discharge or periods, talk to your doctor. If you are told that <em>"it is just a normal part of being a woman"</em> without any kind of exam or tests done, go see someone else.

Persistent bloating, however, is one of the number one signs of ovarian cancer. Other symptoms similar to this include getting full really quickly or having a hard time eating and back or abdominal pain. If you are experiencing these along with bloating, speak to your doctor.</p><figure><img title="Bloating" src="IMG/BB1pwlzG_bloating.jpg" alt="Bloating"><figcaption><em>Bloating.

Pay attention, however, if this pressure and discomfort seems more than usual, lasts longer, or is occurring out of your regular "period symptom window". Remember, anytime a symptom is constant or persistent, it could be a sign that something else is going on.</p><figure><img title="Pelvic Pain or Pressure" src="IMG/BB1pw7NR_pelvic_pain_or_pressure.jpg" alt="Pelvic Pain or Pressure"><figcaption><em>Pelvic Pain or Pressure.

Also, pay attention to a change in the color of the vulva or the skin. This could be in the form of a rash, sores, or warts.</p><figure><img title="Itching, Burning, and Pain" src="IMG/BB1pwh4g_itching_burning_and_pain.jpg" alt="Itching, Burning, and Pain"><figcaption><em>Itching, Burning, and Pain.

Women must regularly check their breasts and know what to look for to catch breast cancer as early as possible. Beyond going in for regular mammograms, especially for women over 50 years old, symptoms to be aware of include (4):</p><ul>   <li>swelling of all or part of the breast </li>   <li>skin irritation or dimpling </li>   <li>breast pain </li>   <li>nipple pain or the nipple turning inward </li>   <li>redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin </li>   <li>a nipple discharge other than breast milk </li>   <li>a lump in the underarm area</li>  </ul><p>Again, don't allow doctors to wave you off for any of these symptoms. Many times breast pain will be written off as sensitivity due to the menstrual cycle or a lump as a blocked milk duct for breastfeeding women. If you are told these things without being offered actual tests or exams, go see another doctor.</p><figure><img title="Breast Cancer Symptoms" src="IMG/BB1pwaqi_breast_cancer_symptoms.jpg" alt="Breast Cancer Symptoms"><figcaption><em>Breast Cancer Symptoms.

We, as women, have also become used to living with pain or discomfort because we've been told that this is just part of being a woman with a menstrual cycle. Whether it is cancer or not, we must stand up for ourselves and be advocates for our own health so that we actually get the answers and help that we need. The next time you are at the doctor, pay attention and be sure that they are not just chalking up your experience to your period, menopause, motherhood, or the like. If they refuse to take you seriously, go see someone else. Perhaps your symptoms are benign, but if they aren't, you will be glad that you stood up for yourself.</p></main>
