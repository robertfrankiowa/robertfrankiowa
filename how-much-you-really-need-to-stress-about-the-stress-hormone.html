Flare-up of acne? Messed-up cortisol. Can’t sleep/focus/fend off cravings for crummy foods? Cortisol, cortisol, cortisol.</p><p>Or at least this is what social health-fluencers—some doctors and nurses, others just regular people sharing personal experiences—would have you believe. (Oh, and here’s a cortisol-managing supplement they’d like to sell you.) While there is a solid body of actual research behind how cortisol works, the science behind how much you need to worry about “balancing” the levels of the hormone in your body (especially with supplements) is far iffier.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Cortisol Truths</h2><p>Cortisol isn’t designed to work against you. It’s a steroid produced by the body’s two adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, in response to signals from the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the brain. Otherwise known as the stress hormone, cortisol modulates the body’s fight-or-flight response and is secreted into the bloodstream when you face a threat. If you hear the telltale clatter of a rattlesnake on a hike, your cortisol levels may spike. If you have an intense last-minute work deadline you’re struggling to meet, same. That’s not exactly to your detriment: An increase in cortisol triggers the liver to release glucose into your blood so that you can summon the energy to confront danger—be that dashing from said rattlesnake or toward said deadline. </p><p>In addition, cortisol serves other crucial functions. The hormone regulates blood pressure, maintains your metabolism, and fights inflammation. It’s also essential to your circadian rhythm, the natural 24-hour cycle set by the hypothalamus, which explains why blood levels of the hormone are highest in the morning, when you need to wake up, and lowest in the evening, just before (most) people go to sleep. Its job description is so complex that it’s easy to misunderstand.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Cortisol Almost-Truths</h2><p>“The purpose of cortisol is to maintain sort of an equilibrium in people’s body,” says Adrian Sandra Dobs, M.D., a professor of medicine and oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The right amount of the hormone helps your body do many different jobs.</p><p>Various TikTok influencers who talk cortisol claim that changes they have made have balanced their levels of the hormone, keeping them from being too high or too low. They argue that correcting imbalances—using tactics like drinking more water, eating carbs only with other foods, and following them on TikTok, as one recommends—can lead to better sleep, less anxiety, more energy, and clearer skin. </p><p>The idea of balance isn’t totally wrong, says Tara Scott, M.D., the medical director of Forum Health in Akron, Ohio, who goes by Hormone Guru on TikTok. But blaming cortisol levels for every problem isn’t totally right, either, the experts we talked to say. Anyone who claims in a TikTok to have cured their high or low levels of cortisol is probably going off conjecture. You can’t feel cortisol. There’s truly no way of knowing whether your levels are high or low without a medical test to analyze blood, urine, or saliva. And even if you test your cortisol, the results are hard to interpret. “It depends on the person, it depends on the time of day, it depends on what medications they take,” says Dr. Dobs. “So a random, one-time-only test is not very informative.” It's driven up by things like infections and serious injuries and even coffee, if you don't drink it regularly. Levels move down with consistent, quality sleep that lasts 7 to 9 hours, and moves including meditation and having your dog nearby when you're stressed. Cortisol is so fickle, Dr. Scott adds, that “you could do a cortisol test every single day for seven days and you could potentially get seven different results.” </p><p>That makes it an easy scapegoat for health issues that can’t be explained otherwise. (One TikTok even features a 20-something woman confidently stating that corralling her cortisol is the reason behind her finally having a jawline and visible abs.) Because people are individual systems, not general rules, there could be many other reasons to explain weight gain, fatigue, or poor sleeping habits. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Legit Cortisol Concerns</h2><p>The trouble with the blanket “cortisol is my problem” message comes down to the nuanced nature of the hormone. “Just having high cortisol isn’t a disease state,” says Dr. Dobs. Your levels aren’t necessarily a medical issue until they rise or drop past normal parameters and become legitimately too high or too low. “If someone comes in with abdominal obesity and a red, ruddy face coloring, we’ll look for reasons and measure cortisol levels,” she says. That could indicate Cushing’s syndrome, in which there is consistently too much cortisol in the body, sometimes due to a pituitary tumor. (On the opposite end, damage to the adrenal glands can cause Addison’s disease, in which you produce too little of the hormone and feel tired and run down.)</p><p>It’s not clear how bad it truly is when cortisol levels hit the high-normal range (since they might be there at one moment but not the next). It may depend on how long they stay high, which you don’t really have a way of knowing. But it is clear that if you’re doing things that aren’t good for your body—habits also associated with cortisol elevations, like experiencing chronic stress and not sleeping enough—then you should find ways to deal with those issues regardless of how many micrograms per deciliter your cortisol changes. </p><p>The smart play: Worry less about this hormone and worry more about your lifestyle choices. You don’t need a cortisol test to know if you’re stressed or if you’re carrying too much extra weight. And if you’re wrestling with an issue like acne or off-kilter sleeping patterns, get it checked out by a doctor. “There’s so much junk out there,” Dr. Dobs says. “Cortisol’s natural biological response is good and healthy, and we should sort of let it do its thing.” But if you feel your life is out of balance, it’s worth spending some energy on reshuffling things.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
