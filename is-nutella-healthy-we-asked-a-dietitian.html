Potential Benefits of Nutella</h2><p>Nutella has a few health benefits, as it is made with simple ingredients like hazelnuts and milk products. Hazelnuts are rich in healthy fats, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Plus, flavored with cocoa, Nutella also contains flavonoids, which are heart-healthy antioxidants.</p><p>With 11 grams of fat per 2-tablespoon serving, Nutella mostly contains monounsaturated fats from hazelnuts. It is also low in sodium and offers one gram of fiber per serving.</p><figure><img title="2. Potential Benefits of Nutella" src="IMG/AA1ivauG_2_potential_benefits_of_nutella.jpg" alt="2. Potential Benefits of Nutella"><figcaption><em>2. Potential Benefits of Nutella. © Provided by Eat This, Not That!</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3. Potential Drawbacks of Nutella</h2><p>On the other hand, Nutella is also high in added sugars and contains some saturated fat from Palm oil. Like all nut butter, Nutella is a rich source of calories for a small serving size. With 200 calories per two-tablespoon portion, it's easy to overdo and take in more calories than you realize.</p><p>Excess added sugar in your diet can negatively affect cardiovascular disease and other metabolic conditions, as we saw in an umbrella review of 8,601 articles in the <em>British Medical Journal.</em> According to the American Heart Association, the recommended daily allowance for added sugar is 24 grams daily for women and 36 grams for men. For women, this is almost all of the recommended daily allowance.</p><p>Plus, the combination of sugar and fat in Nutella can make it highly palatable and potentially easy to overconsume. Often, you will find Nutella in desserts and snacks that are also high in added sugar, which can contribute to your total daily allowance and possibly overshoot it. While these choices won't harm your health from time to time, if you're regularly consuming Nutella thinking it's a healthy snack, you may want to rethink that choice.</p><figure><img title="3.

While it contains some beneficial ingredients like hazelnuts and cocoa, these might be outweighed for some by the sugar and calorie content. We recommend consuming Nutella in moderation or balancing it with other foods with fiber to stay full longer.</p><figure><img title="4.
