Provided by Mediafeed</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="server-jss88126 server-jss88131 server-jss88245 server-jss88513">Do you lose weight when you get older?</h2><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Yes, but only in small amounts over time. It's normal for your body's levels of water, muscle, and fat - which all determine your total body weight - to decline as you age, according to the medical journal <em>American Family Physician</em>.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Generally, a person's weight is the highest around age 60, with decreases of less than half a pound every year after age 70. This means gradual weight loss is expected, but you shouldn't disregard a significant, noticeable drop in weight as part of the natural aging process.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">How much weight loss is considered dangerous?</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">"As little as 10 pounds over a month would concern me," said Dr. Barry Fabius, medical director of geriatrics at Holy Redeemer Health System in Philadelphia. "I'm also concerned about weight loss that is slow and progressive."</p><h2 class="server-jss88126 server-jss88131 server-jss88245 server-jss88513">What is sudden weight loss for seniors?</h2><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Sudden senior weight loss is quick, unintentional, and unexplained weight loss in older adults. About 15% to 20% of seniors experience sudden weight loss, according to the <em>Canadian Medical Association Journal</em>.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Though some weight loss can be a normal part of aging, losing a substantial amount of weight over a short period of time can be a sign of an underlying condition. Weight loss in older adults is considered a problem when there's a loss of 5% body weight in one month or 10% over a six-month period.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Some of the health consequences of sudden senior weight loss can be serious:</p><ul class="server-jss88524 ">   <li class="">Loss of ability to perform activities of daily living like bathing, dressing, and grooming</li>   <li class="">Fatigue</li>   <li class="">Greater risk of falls and injuries</li>   <li class="">Worsening of cognitive and mood disorders</li>   <li class="">Increased need for long-term care like assisted living facilities or nursing homes</li>   <li class="">Infections</li>   </ul><h2 class="server-jss88126 server-jss88131 server-jss88245 server-jss88513">Common causes of unintentional weight loss in seniors</h2><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Although sometimes the cause of weight loss in elderly adults goes undiscovered, it may be a sign of an underlying medical condition. If your family member is experiencing rapid weight loss, don't ignore it.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Some of the conditions commonly associated with sudden weight loss in the elderly include:</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Many behavioral and social factors may also affect an older person's eating habits and nutrition level:</p><ul class="server-jss88524 ">   <li class="">Adverse effects of taking multiple medications</li>   <li class="">Limited mobility</li>   <li class="">Reduced food intake due to dental issues</li>   <li class="">Isolation</li>   <li class="">Financial constraints</li>   <li class="">Inadequate or improper caregiving</li>   <li class="">Alcoholism</li>   </ul><h2 class="server-jss88126 server-jss88131 server-jss88245 server-jss88513">Warning signs of failing senior health</h2><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">When it comes to weight loss in the elderly, watch for a few key warning signs:</p><ul class="server-jss88524 ">   <li class=""><strong>Depression.</strong> Sudden weight loss can be associated with depression, social withdrawal, or loss of a will to live.</li>   <li class=""><strong>Loss of smell and taste. </strong>Though a normal part of the aging process, loss of these senses can be worsened by medication or disease, which can result in anorexia.</li>   <li class=""><strong>Constipation. </strong>A common complaint, constipation can be a result of a diet that is lacking adequate nutrients and fluids. Though there are several over-the-counter remedies for constipation, Dr. Fabius also recommends combating poor nutrition with a daily multivitamin and possibly a dietary beverage supplement.</li>   <li class=""><strong>Loss of appetite. </strong>Whether a result of chewing problems or disease, a sudden lack of interest in food is a cause for concern.</li>   </ul><h2 class="server-jss88126 server-jss88131 server-jss88245 server-jss88513">Why it's important to track weight loss in elderly loved ones</h2><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Early detection and action are key to improving your loved one's health.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">"At the first sign of unhealthy weight loss, get them to see a physician as soon as possible," Dr. Fabius says.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">An exam can help you discover and rule out potential causes. In situations like cancer, early treatment can be life-saving.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">No matter the apparent cause of the weight loss, simply staying aware of your loved one's eating habits and weight will help you notice any worrisome changes as they happen.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">In addition to performing a physical examination of the patient, doctors may ask the caregiver for a detailed history of the patient's eating habits and weight.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Dr. Fabius recommends his patients weigh themselves twice weekly, with assistance from caregivers or family members if necessary. He also suggests keeping a food diary, which will help paint an accurate picture of a person's caloric intake and the timing of the weight loss.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">"It's important to see, in that history taking, how many calories they're actually burning," advises Dr. Fabius. "If a patient is meeting or exceeding their caloric needs, that's going to make me suspect hyperthyroidism or a malabsorption syndrome."</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Here are some critical questions doctors may ask:</p><ul class="server-jss88524 ">   <li class="">Is the person taking in enough calories?</li>   <li class="">If so, are they still losing weight?</li>   <li class="">Do they have an appetite?</li>   </ul><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">It's helpful for doctors to understand psychological and social factors in the patient's life, such as dementia, depression, social isolation, and income status. Keeping a detailed record of all prescription and over-the-counter medications could also be useful to doctors and is a safe practice in general.</p><h2 class="server-jss88126 server-jss88131 server-jss88245 server-jss88513">How senior living communities help manage unintentional weight loss in elderly</h2><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Senior care facilities often keep track of factors contributing to your loved one's sudden weight loss as part of their regular services. Most communities, especially nursing homes, measure weight and vitals regularly. Many communities will also work with residents and their families to develop special diet plans to help the seniors manage their weight and improve their overall well-being.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">Assisted living communities offer different services depending on each resident's needs. Most assisted living communities offer meal plans and special dining options, medication management, health monitoring, and social opportunities to help keep senior residents active and safe.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517">It's common for senior residents in assisted living to have their weight and vitals checked monthly. If weight loss is a concern when the resident moves in, staff will likely check their weight weekly or more. Staff at assisted living communities tend to develop close relationships with residents, so it is unlikely for drastic changes in weight or eating habits to go unnoticed.</p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517 server-jss88532"><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517 server-jss88532"><em>American Family Physician</em>. <strong>"Unintentional weight loss in older adults."</strong></p><p class="server-jss88126 server-jss88150 server-jss88177 server-jss88517"><em>British Medical Journal</em>. "<strong>Investigation and management of unintentional weight loss in older adults."</strong></p></main>
