Eight dietitian-recommended sauces.</h1><figure><img title="STEFANI REYNOLDS, AFP via Getty Images" src="IMG/AA17M3Uy_heinz_ketchup_is_displayed_on_a_shelf_at_a_grocery_store_in_washington_dc_on_february_15.jpg" alt="Heinz ketchup is displayed on a shelf at a grocery store in Washington, DC, on February 15."><figcaption><em>Ketchup, mayo and mustard are some of the most popular condiments in America, but the definition of condiment is much broader than that.. STEFANI REYNOLDS, AFP via Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>America loves condiments. After all, what would a hamburger or hot dog be without ketchup and mustard? </p><p>And if classic condiments don’t suit you, there’s likely a product out there you will like – try Heinz’s “BuffaRanch,” Taylor Swift-inspired “Ketchup and Seemingly Ranch” or the brainchild of Cheez-It and Hidden Valley Ranch's “Cheezy Ranch.”</p><p>But, are our favorite dips healthy? Could smothering our meals in sauce impact our health? We spoke with registered dietitian Abbey Sharp about the most nutritious options.</p><p><strong><em>Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.</em></strong></p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What are condiments?</h2><p>A condiment is anything that enhances the flavor of food. Sauces, dips, pastes and even seasonings count as condiments. Favorites include ketchup, mayo, mustard, soy sauce, wasabi and hot sauce.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Are condiments healthy?</h2><p>While many think condiments cancel out any health benefits of the food they’re paired with, registered dietitian Abbey Sharp says they can help us eat a more nutritious, varied diet.</p><p>“I would way rather folks add a condiment that really brightens their day and makes their food enjoyable than for them to swear off that food entirely,” she says. “If ranch is the only way that you’re going to eat vegetables, by all means, you should be adding ranch.” </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What is the healthiest condiment?</h2><p>The lowest-calorie condiment is not always the healthiest choice. Sharp recommends looking for an opportunity to pack in extra nutrients instead.</p><p>Her favorite is guacamole because of the healthy fats, potassium and fiber from the avocado. </p><p>“When a condiment can add healthy fats and fiber or protein, it’s actually adding nutrition to our overall diet … and also improving the satiety profile of our meal,” Sharp says.</p><p>These are the healthiest condiments Sharp recommends, some of which are low-calorie with a punchy flavor and others have more calories but contain beneficial vitamins, minerals and other nutrients:</p><ul><li>Guacamole</li><li>Mustard</li><li>Balsamic Vinegar</li><li>Salsa</li><li>Hot sauce</li><li>Tzatziki</li><li>Hummus</li><li>Pesto</li></ul><p>Spice blends, like everything bagel seasoning or tajin, are another fun, low-calorie way to flavor your food. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">How to shop for healthy condiments</h2><p>Not sure where to start at the grocery store? Keep these tips in mind when you’re browsing for the best condiment.</p><p>First – don’t fall for the “fat-free” marketing. Fat-free and low-fat condiments often add extra sugar or salt to compensate for taste. The diet culture mindset that fat is bad picked up steam in the 80s and 90s, but certain fats are essential to the human body.</p><p>“I would rather folks get the full-fat version which is going to have more satiety power than for them to go with the fat-free option that’s actually just got more sugar in it,” Sharp says.</p><p>Keep an eye out for added ingredients as well – keep added sugar and salt to a minimum, Sharp advises. You can spot these on the ingredient label by looking for syrups or anything that ends in “ose,” the standard suffix for the names of sugars.</p><p>Generally, the healthiest products will have simple ingredient lists. </p><p>“Hot sauce (is) basically just spices and vinegar, maybe some tomato paste,” Sharp says. “Those are the kinds of things that we want to be looking for – when (we) get a big flavor bang for our caloric buck.”</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Is mayonnaise bad for you?</h2><p>Mayo is higher in calories and saturated fat than some other condiments, but that doesn't mean you have to stop eating it. Unlike lower-calorie or nutritionally dense options, mind your portion size with this condiment.</p><p>Sharp suggests “stretching” your portions – mix mayo with another nutritionally dense condiment instead of having it on its own. For savory dishes, try mixing a tablespoon of mayo with a tablespoon of full-fat Greek yogurt. With egg, tuna or chicken salad, Sharp likes to mix mayo and mashed avocado. </p><p>“It’s a really great way to add healthy fats but you’re still getting that creamy consistency and a lot more flavor,” she says.</p><p>You can employ this hack with virtually any condiment or sauce, Sharp says; Make your store-bought sauce go a little further with fewer calories by adding a little chicken or bone broth.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Discover more health tips for your daily diet: </h2><ul><li><strong>Healthiest vegetable:</strong> Check out these great nutrient-dense options</li><li><strong>Healthiest fast food:</strong> Look for this kind of menu next time you're out</li><li><strong>Healthiest oil:</strong> Most have some benefits but these two might be best</li><li><strong>Healthiest diet: </strong>Why the answer encompasses more than just food</li><li><strong>Healthiest options for picky eaters: </strong>Check out these nutritious foods</li></ul></main>
