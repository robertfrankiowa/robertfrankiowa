    <main><h1>The Best Workout Clothes For Women From Top Activewear Brands, According to Experts</h1><i> <em> If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission. </em> </i><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Whether it's a pilates princess aesthetic or tenniscore-inspired styling, the best workout clothes for women have become trends in and of themselves for 2024. Take a look around your local workout studio or gym, and we'd bet you'll agree: Women's workout clothes have never been more aligned with fashion trends, turning your treadmill session into a personal catwalk. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Just like workout clothing's recent strides in style, performance technology has swiftly advanced in just a few short years: Most brands now offer moisture-wicking fabrications that not only keep you dry, but also regulate body temperature while you're hard at work reaching new PRs, like Nike's Dri-Fit line or Lululemon's cult-favorite leggings. On the high-tech front, you can also find activewear with GPS tracking, heart rate monitors, or extra supportive smart fabrications that cradle muscles and correct posture with compression, while other functional features like side pockets for your tech or tennis balls and convertible strapping on high-impact sports bras are more commonly embraced across top fitness brands. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Of course, fit and style are essential, too, according to Barry's X founding instructor Taryn Brooks. "Most workout clothes are generally comfortable, so I look for pieces that feel unique and stylish and that I can pair with a jacket or blazer so I can run around town in between classes while still feeling (and looking) chic." After all, there's nothing like that post-pilates victory lap to the grocery story or smoothie shop. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> "I love to think about how someone wants to feel when they get ready to work out," says Kristal Hill, former Creative Director of Design for FP Movement. "I'm always considering the type of fitness different people love. If it's more soft and graceful, it will inform more femininity with delicate details, or if it's more intense and powerful, then that will translate through stronger materials and details." In your search for the best workout clothes, it's important to choose activewear styles suited for your activities of choice. Do you need an option for HIIT class or a 45-minute Peloton ride? Higher-impact activities will require more supportive pieces than lower-impact ones, like, say, a yoga or Tai Chi class. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Below, discover our expert-approved guide of the best women's activewear brands to shop this summer, plus insight on fabrics to look for and how to properly wash away all that earned sweat after a winning workout.</p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  lrv-u-text-align-center"> Top Workout Clothing Brands for Women of 2024 </h2><ul>    <li><strong>Alo Yoga</strong></li>    <li><strong>Adidas</strong></li>    <li><strong>Lululemon</strong></li>    <li><strong>Nike</strong></li>    <li><strong>Tory Sport</strong></li>    <li><strong>Fp Movement</strong></li>    <li><strong>Gymshark</strong></li>    <li><strong>Girlfriend Collective</strong></li>    <li><strong>Athleta</strong></li>    <li><strong>Staud Court</strong></li>    <li><strong>Bandier</strong></li>    </ul><h3 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl lrv-u-font-weight-bold u-font-size-26@desktop-xl u-font-size-22 u-font-size-20@mobile-max  lrv-u-text-align-center"> Alo Yoga </h3><ul>    <li><strong>Year founded:</strong> 2007</li>    <li><strong>Bestsellers</strong>: 7/8 High-Waist Airlift Legging, Aspire Tank, Alosoft Suns Out Onesie, Match Point Tennis Skirt</li>    <li><strong>Known for:</strong> Elevated California athleisure and flattering fits</li>    </ul><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> One of the hottest celebrity-loved brands on the market - Alo Yoga - was founded as a yoga brand by childhood friends in 2007.

Through the years, they were known for soccer, track, and tennis gear as well as streetwear, especially in the mid-'80s thanks to Run-D.M.C. These days, what sets Adidas apart is its fashionable collaborations, most notably the Adidas By Stella McCartney workout clothing line that's approaching its 25th anniversary next year. Adidas also puts a huge emphasis on sustainability, with many of their women's workout clothes designed with recycled materials. Another highlight of Adidas' sustainable practices is its Parley line, a partnership with Parley of the Oceans that turns plastic collected from water into activewear. </p><h2 class="product-card__title"> Adidas Optime Full-Length Leggings </h2><p>  Buy Now at adidas </p><p class="product-card__description"> Shoppers rave over these leggings for their exceptionally comfortable, full-leg fit.

The rest is history - Bandier is a leading force in the athleisure category and counts celebrities from Emily Ratajkowski, Hilary Duff, Anya Taylor-Joy, Kaia Gerber, Jennifer Garner, Lady Gaga, and many more as avid wearers of the brand's blockbusting leggings and sports bras.

Sports bras come in a variety of silhouettes, like longline fits that double as crop tops. You'll want to determine the amount of support needed for your bust first, then play with cutouts, fun strapping, and bright colors that can be worn under atop or paired with high-waisted bottoms. </li>    <li><strong>A comfortable top</strong>: If you want more coverage than just a sports bra, a lightweight tank or sweat-wicking tee is your best bet. Consider stretchy and thin fabrications with cuts that offer the most mobility, like crop tops and muscle tees that won't constrict you or pool sweat.</li>    <li><strong>Bottoms to your liking</strong>: Whether you opt for workout leggings, shorts, or a tennis skort, consider where you want the waistline to hit. "I look for a high-rise waistband, so I don't feel like I'm spilling over the top," Sheahan says. Your bottoms should fit snugly, so they stay in place. "There's nothing more annoying than having to pull up your leggings every few seconds when you're in the middle of a killer workout."</li>    <li><strong>Tennis dresses:</strong> An activewear dress is a great, versatile addition to any wardrobe, whether you're an avid athlete or stick to simple "hot girl walks." Not only do they align with prominent tenniscore and athluxury trends, they also make for breathable, one-and-done outfits that wick sweat as you go about busy summer activities. </li>    </ul><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> The Best Fabrics to Look for in Workout Clothes for Women </h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> When shopping for optimal activewear, prioritize fabrications that are stretchy, thin, and breathable to avoid constriction that would get in the way of reaching your fitness goals. Moisture-wicking, odor-resistant, and UV protective features are always a major plus, but it all depends on your chosen activity and the type of activewear you prefer to sport. No matter which activity-specific silhouette you land on, the pair should include fabrics that are durable, comfortable, and not see-through.</p><ul>    <li><strong>Spandex</strong>: Also referred to as Lycra, Spandex is one of the most flexible fabrics that grant you a full range of movement. It's a form-fitting synthetic material, which holds snug to your natural shape while providing elastic support. "To me, it's all about spandex," says Sheahan. "It's lightweight yet durable, breathable but not see-through and sweat-wicking, so you have less of a chance walking into Whole Foods post-workout showing off how hard you worked in class." Hill also keeps to materials that "wick away sweat and dry quickly but still maintain a softness and comfort." It's not as breathable as other common activewear fabrications, but it lays thin and lightweight against the skin, making for a flattering choice for garments that benefit from seamless stretch, like sports bras, leggings, or bike shorts. </li>    <li><strong>Cotton</strong>: Known for its breathability and softness, cotton makes for an excellent fabric in workout tops, shorts, and tennis dresses. It's resistant to odor and super lightweight, making it perfect for summer. However, keep in mind that cotton may absorb or trap sweat close to the skin, so it's best suited for low-impact activities or outdoor sports, like yoga or tennis. </li>    <li><strong>Polyester</strong>: Polyester is a common, plastic-based fabric that's durable, easy to clean, and wrinkle-resistant - ideal for packing a post-office gym bag or activewear for travel. It can even repel UV rays (but that's no excuse to skip sunscreen!). Polyester is more breathable than cotton, though it can retain odor, so opt for the fabric in lower-sweat activities like walking or yoga. </li>    <li><strong>Nylon</strong>: Nylon exists in a middle ground between spandex and polyester. It's one of the most durable, easy-to-clean fabrics you can wear, so it's best suited for intense activity, like hiking, cross-training, or weight-lifting. It dries quickly and absorbs very low levels of moisture, so it wears very lightweight upon the skin. </li>    <li><strong>Bamboo</strong>: If you're in the market for eco-friendly activewear, bamboo fabrications will be your best friend. Not only is it plant-based, it's biodegradable, making it a far better option than synthetic fabrics like polyester or nylon that are made from plastic. Much like bedding made of bamboo, activewear garments made of the fabric are supremely soft, breathable, and temperature-regulating, as well as being naturally hypoallergenic (great for sensitive skin), moisture-wicking, and UV repellant. </li>    </ul><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> How to Wash Activewear </h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Activewear is designed with specialized fabrics that differ from other items in your hamper. Drew Westervelt, founder and CEO of HEX Performance, a laundry detergent made for activewear, provides some helpful tips. "Most activewear is made of tightly-woven modern fabrics, including nylon and spandex. Regular detergent can clog fibers and ruin high-performance fabrics," he shares. A detergent that is made especially for activewear will not only clean your gear but protect the integrity and eliminate odor-causing bacteria - consider detergents like Hex Performance, Tide Plus Febreze Sport Active, or The Laundress sport detergent. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> To start, run your pieces in the washer on a gentle, cold wash setting and "avoid using too much detergent to try to clean better, as it actually makes things worse," Westervelt advises. Next, hang dry your workout clothes or place them in the dryer. If you go the latter route, keep in mind that "traditional dryer sheets are not suited for activewear, since they leave a wax coating on the fabric that damages the flexible sweat-wicking features," Westervelt warns. To avoid damage, he recommends using HEX Performance's Wet Dryer Sheets, which are made to clean, soften and protect without leaving any residue behind.</p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> How We Chose the Best Workout Clothes for Women </h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Since 1910, WWD - often referred to as "the fashion bible" - has been the leading industry voice of authority for senior executives in the global women's and men's fashion, retail and beauty communities, while also informing the consumer media that cover the market.
