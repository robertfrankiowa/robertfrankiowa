Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>Losing or keeping belly fat in check isn't simply about achieving a certain kind of body. Every body is a bikini body. However, avoiding (or nixing) excess belly fat can significantly improve your overall health.</p><p>"Excess belly fat is usually a warning sign of too much visceral fat," <strong>Dr. Lauren Donnangelo, MD,</strong> a specialist in gastroenterology and obesity medicine at True You Weight Loss. "Excess visceral fat is inflammatory and contributes to the development and progression of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes and elevated cholesterol."</p><p>Various factors contribute to the amount of belly fat we have, some of which (genetics) we can't control. However, habits and routines matter too—and that's empowering.</p><p>"Patients who plan and adhere to healthy routines are typically the most successful in losing and maintaining weight over the long term," Dr. Donnangelo says. "Preparedness and consistency are key."</p><p>Despite all the "must-have" wellness items pushed our way through targeted ads, Dr. Donnangelo says the best routines take us back to basics, especially one. She shares the simple routine change that can significantly reduce belly fat, plus other foundational tips.</p><h2>What Is Visceral Fat And Why Does It Matter?</h2><p>Visceral fat accumulates around the belly, and it poses health risks. "As compared to subcutaneous fat—which is stored immediately beneath the skin—visceral fat lies deep in the abdomen, surrounding the abdominal organs, such as the liver, pancreas and kidneys," Dr. Donnangelo explains.</p><p>A person can have a normal BMI but carry too much visceral fat, which research shows increases the risk for heart problems.</p><p>"BMI and scale number are often poor indicators of metabolic health," Dr. Donnangelo says. "A body composition scan—a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry—is a superior tool, which quantifies fat and lean muscle mass."</p><p>Still, Dr. Donnangelo says that excess visceral fat can contribute to overweight and obesity and the development and progression of metabolic diseases, something that was also highlighted in a 2021 study.</p><p>"A primary goal of medical weight loss is reducing this particular type of fat to a healthy level,"  Dr. Donnangelo explains.</p><h2>The Routine Change That Can Do a Number on Belly Fat</h2><p>"Increase physical activity," Dr. Donnangelo says. It's likely not a surprise. What could surprise you is that you don't have to swing for the fences—at least night right out of the gate. Slow and steady wins the race (and may be all you need). "Walking daily and strength training twice weekly is a great place to start," Dr. Donnangelo suggests.</p><p>The American Heart Association's recommendations for physical activity support this idea. The AHA recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, preferably spread over a few days. However, the AHA says even light-intensity exertion can combat some of the effects of a sedentary lifestyle. The AHA also suggests working in resistance training at least twice per week.</p><p>The AHA considers walking at a pace of 2.5 miles per hour as moderate-intensity exercise. Don't have a smartwatch? Tune into your body. Moderate-intensity exercise will involve faster heartbeats and harder breathing, but you can still converse with a fit family member. </p><p>A 2022 study of postmenopausal women found that participants lost visceral fat whether they walked quickly or slowly. Participants who walked at slower speeds but longer durations zapped more total body fat than those who engaged in short, fast walking sessions. An older, small study of 20 women found that walking could decrease belly fat.</p><p>A more extensive 2021 <em>Sports Medicine</em> review of more than 50 studies found that resistance training reduced belly fat in healthy adults.  </p><p>While strength training often involves weights, bodyweight exercises like push-ups and bird dogs require nothing but commitment.</p><h2>Other Tips</h2><p>Exercise—even simple movement—can reduce belly fat. However, it's not the only piece to the puzzle. Dr. Donnangelo says other essential habits to develop to ward off belly fat include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Diet</strong>. "Aim to follow a minimally-processed, whole-food, plant-predominant dietary pattern," she says. Research published in 2022 showed that a Mediterranean-style diet high in polyphenols (found in tea, beans and veggies)</p></li><li><p><strong>Sipping water and avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages. </strong>Added sugar can contribute to visceral fat, 2020 research found.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritize 7 to 9 hours of restful sleep per night. </strong>Mayo Clinic research has linked poor sleep with visceral fat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stress reduction</strong>. Research shows chronic stress can contribute to visceral fat. Dr. Donnangelo recommends practicing gratitude, focusing on purpose and maintaining positive social connections.</p></li></ul><h2>The No. 1 Piece of Advice for Losing Belly Fat, According to a Weight Loss Specialist</h2><p>Any of the above habits would be an excellent place to start, even if regular exercise has many benefits. The biggest key is to pace yourself. "I recommend that my patients gradually add small, sustainable behaviors to their daily routines to build toward significant and lasting lifestyle change," Dr. Donnangelo says. "The key to lifelong weight loss and maintenance is focusing on easy and sustainable habits that act as the foundation for long-term lifestyle change. These recommendations may seem simple, but the benefits compound exponentially over time."</p><p>In other words, take it one step at a time—whether you're taking Dr. Donnangelo's advice to start walking more often or are replacing your afternoon soda habit with water mixed with fresh mint. </p><p>"I recommend that my patients make one small positive change at a time until it becomes second nature," Dr. Donnangelo says. "Then, they can add a second healthy habit, and so forth...It is important to keep in mind that weight management is a marathon, not a sprint. The focus should be on consistency over a long-term horizon. </p></main>
