People who suffer from mental health issues are often told to suck it up because there are always people out there who have it worse. There is some truth to that, but it doesn’t make their struggles any less valid.</p><p>Mental health is not something that people should be ashamed of. Instead, it should be taken seriously and discussed more openly so that more people can get help and feel better.</p><h2>Mental Health Tradgedies in the Public Spotlight</h2><p>In the wake of Kate Spade’s death, it is essential to understand the relationship between mental health and depression to bring greater awareness to those at risk. Kate Spade admitted to having suffered from depression and anxiety for years. She kept it a secret until her death because mental illness is still a taboo subject in our society. But it should be taken just as seriously as a physical ailment.</p><p>In an interview with People magazine in 2017, Kate Spade said she suffered from depression and anxiety for years but “never felt it was that bad” until recently. Tragedy struck again on Wednesday when Anthony Bourdain, the host of CNN’s “Parts Unknown,” died at 61 in France of an apparent suicide by hanging.</p><p>Bourdain was open about his past struggles with drug addiction, which he described in his 2000 book “Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly.” He had been sober for more than 20 years at the time of his death, but he said he had seen some of his friends die from suicide after becoming sober following years of drug abuse. </p><p>Both losses of these tremendous icons show just how pervasive, powerful, and indiscriminate mental health can be. It can affect anyone, anywhere, at various levels of career success, and lead to tragic consequences when left unchecked. </p><h2>Recognizing and Addressing Mental Health Setbacks</h2><p>Just like physical illness, mental health can hold you back in life and stop you from enjoying your day-to-day activities. It can affect your relationships with friends and family, social life, and career or education. Mental health issues are prevalent in the United States, but there is still such a stigma surrounding them that people don’t feel comfortable talking about them or getting help for them.</p><p>Many people feel embarrassed that they have mental illness because they think it makes them weak or inferior to other people who don’t have these problems. Some even avoid medical treatment because they don’t want others to know about their condition. But just as we shouldn’t judge someone for having cancer or diabetes, we shouldn’t judge someone for having a mental illness either.</p><h2>How Do We Keep Our Mental Health Healthy?</h2><p>We spend a lot of time worrying about whether our bodies work correctly, but if we’re honest, most of us don’t give our mental health enough attention.</p><p>The World Health Organization says: “There is no health without mental health,” and that just as physical health can be damaged by poor nutrition and lack of exercise, so too can our mental well-being suffer when we aren’t paying attention to it.</p><p>So, how do we keep our mental health healthy? Here are some tips:</p><h2>1. Exercise Daily</h2><p>Exercising doesn’t just improve your physical health. It can also boost your mood, help you manage stress, fight anxiety and depression, improve sleep, and increase self-esteem. Find an activity you enjoy, plan to fit it into your schedule, and stick with it.</p><h2>2. Eat a Healthy Diet</h2><p>Maintaining a healthy diet means paying attention to what you eat and drink. Eating properly means choosing foods that give you the nutrients needed for good health. Ensure your diet includes whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products while limiting saturated fat, sugar, salt (sodium), and alcohol consumption.</p><h2>3. Get Enough Sleep</h2><p>Sleep is more than just a time when your body rests and recharges. It’s also a time when many critical biological processes occur in the brain. Getting enough sleep helps these processes happen regularly so you can learn new things or remember what you learned in school or at work the next day.</p><h2>4. Use Meditation to Calm Your Nerves</h2><p>An excellent way to keep our mental health healthy is by using meditation to calm your nerves. Meditation is a simple way to ease stress and improve your overall health. You can learn how to meditate wherever you are, whenever you want, for free.</p><p>There are many different types of meditation, but the goal is to focus your mind on something so you can let go of stress and distracting thoughts. It’s often used as a tool for relaxation and self-reflection.</p><p>Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years. Meditation was initially meant to help deepen our understanding of life’s sacred and mystical forces. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction.</p><p>Meditation can also help solve problems, improve health, handle stress, find inner peace, and feel happier.</p><h2>5. Talk Through Your Struggle</h2><p>It’s easy to assume that all your colleagues and friends will want to listen to your problems, but they may not – or they might not be able to. Don’t let your problems become a burden on them.</p><p>Talking about your problems with trusted friends and colleagues can be very helpful. It’s important to remember, though, that everyone is different. Some people can help you in a crisis, while others may not know what to say or do.</p><p>The more you talk about your problems, the more they become a part of your identity. If you can find a way to avoid doing that — and maybe even get some distance on them — it will put you in a better position overall.</p><p>It is essential to take your health seriously. If you feel like something is off, talk to someone about it. It might be challenging, but it will make you feel better in the long run, and you never know what they can help you with. Also, if you don’t feel comfortable talking to your parents, there are mental health counselors that can help you.</p><p>We hope this article helped you understand how vital Mental Health is and how it can affect your everyday life. It is extremely common for people to ignore or hide their mental health issues. This may be the case for many reasons. However, if you or someone you love is struggling with mental health, it is crucial to get help.</p></main>
