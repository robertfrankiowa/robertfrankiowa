Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Inflammation is a major health and weight loss buzzword, and for good reason: Chronic inflammation has been linked with many health issues, including obesity. While various things can contribute to chronic inflammation, one of the biggest culprits is diet.</p><p>The typical Western diet, which tends to be heavy on animal meat and fats, high-fat dairy, and refined grains and sugars, promotes inflammatory compounds, according to one research report.</p><p>Just as some foods can promote inflammation, however, others may counter inflammatory compounds and their disease-promoting effects — namely, fruits and vegetables, a major source of nutrients like fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants that Western diets tend to skimp on. Here are 10 foods that nutrition experts suggest adding to your plate.</p><h3>1. Avocados</h3><p>Eating an avocado daily can positively influence the gut microbiome, leading to metabolic health benefits like reduced inflammation, according to a randomized controlled trial. “Avocados are packed with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats,” says Meghan Garrity, a registered dietitian based in New York City. “Try adding sliced avocado to a slice of whole grain bread or add atop your salad or mix into a smoothie for extra creamy texture.”</p><h3>2. Blueberries</h3><p>“I eat blueberries just about every day because they taste great and they’re packed with health-promoting bioactive substances,” says Samantha Cassetty, a registered dietitian and co-author of <em>Sugar Shock</em>. For example, blueberries’ payload of anthocyanins have potent anti-inflammatory properties, according to research.</p><p>“These anthocyanins may also be beneficial when trying to lose weight,” Cassetty notes. One twin study found that the twins with higher anthocyanin intake were leaner than their identical siblings eating lower amounts.</p><p>“I’ll often microwave frozen blueberries for a minute to let their juices release and then add the heated berries to yogurt or oatmeal,” says Cassetty. “It’s a great way to naturally sweeten plain versions of these foods while also getting all of the blueberry benefits.”</p><h3>3. Legumes</h3><p>The antioxidants and bioactive compounds found in legumes have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body, research shows. “Because legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and black beans are a rich source of protein and fiber, they promote feelings of fullness that can help with weight loss,” says Garrity. “Try using them as the protein source in your salads or blend up to make a spread or dip.”</p><h3>4. Wheat Bran</h3><p>This health-food-store staple has anti-inflammatory properties, according to a research review. “It’s also an incredible source of nutrition — rich in B vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals such as magnesium,” says Garrity. It’s a filling, high-fiber food that helps reduce the likelihood of overeating. Garrity suggests adding it to your yogurt or smoothie.</p><h3>5. Spinach</h3><p>Studies have shown that spinach and other leafy greens can reduce C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. “I always have fresh and frozen spinach at home. You can add it to smoothies, pasta sauce, and soups, as well as use it in salads or saute it for an easy side dish,” says Cassetty.</p><h3>6. Garlic</h3><p>The sulfur-containing compounds (such as allicin) found in garlic are well-established inflammation busters, according to research. One of the most flavorful low-calorie ingredients available, garlic is a great way to add punch to your food without a lot of fat or calories. “Try mincing garlic and adding it to a salad dressing,” says Garrity.</p><h3>7. Walnuts</h3><p>Walnuts encourage the growth of beneficial gut bacteria that make urolithin A, a compound that has anti-inflammatory properties, according to a research review. They’re also a rich source of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, which also help tamp down inflammation, per the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>Some studies show that walnuts have been linked with less weight gain and a lower risk of obesity over time. Cassetty suggests sprinkling chopped walnuts onto other healthy, lower-calorie foods, like oatmeal and salad, to make them taste better and add healthy fat.</p><h3>8. Broccoli</h3><p>A member of the cruciferous vegetable family, broccoli is abundant in antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, and E and beta carotene. It also contains compounds called glucosinolates, which are known to have a significant anti-inflammatory effect, according to a research review. “Broccoli is high in fiber and water content and low in calories, making it a great choice to support weight loss,” says Garrity. “Try roasting in the oven with a drizzle of olive oil or cook and add to your favorite soup.”</p><h3>9. Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</h3><p>Extra-virgin olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids and is rich in antioxidants, including vitamin E, says Garrity. “Recent research published in <em>Nutrition Reviews</em> has demonstrated the health benefits extra-virgin olive oil has on our gut health and the composition of our gut microbiome. This may have a positive impact on weight,” she says. Try using it for salad dressings or drizzling in soup.</p><p>Citrus fruits such as mandarin oranges, clementines, grapefruit, and lemons have antioxidants including vitamin C, flavonoids, and carotenoids. These and other nutrients found in citrus fruits can help control oxidative stress and inflammation, according to a research review.</p><p>“Citrus fruit is low in calories and high in fiber and water content, making it a great choice to support weight loss. Grab a clementine for a quick and easy snack, or add fresh orange or grapefruit slices to your salad,” says Garrity.</p><h2>Foods That Promote Inflammation</h2><p>While the precise way inflammation and weight gain contribute to each other isn’t fully understood, it’s clear the two are related and that reducing one is a good way to reduce the other. While adding foods that fight inflammation to your regular diet can help, it's also a good idea to cut back on some of the foods that have been shown to promote chronic inflammation. And there is one major culprit: ultra-processed foods.</p><p>Ultra-processed foods are basically made in a lab from components of foods like fats, starches, and added colors and flavors, according to Harvard Medical School, and they tend to be high in salt, sugar, and saturated fat, while skimping on essential nutrients. Soda, hot dogs, and packaged cookies are some examples of ultra-processed foods. One review concluded that rising consumption of ultra-processed foods “may contribute to promote a pro-inflammatory state.” </p><p>Doing your best to limit ultra-processed foods in your diet can go a long way to helping quell chronic inflammation. </p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Focusing on plant-based whole foods and avoiding ultra-processed ones can help keep both your weight and inflammation in check. Adding these top 10 anti-inflammatory superstar foods to your grocery shopping list is a great start.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
