    <main><h1>Becky Greenan Reveals Her 10-Minute At-Home Workout</h1><p>Do you want to get your abs toned in time for summer? All you need is a pair of free weights and about ten minutes, according to Becky Greenan. The 37-year-old mother-of-two flashes her impressive six-pack during one of her latest at-home workouts, demonstrating a few key moves that help her maintain her flat abs. "Abs & Core ðŸ¤˜ Grab some light dumbbells and try this out," she captioned the Instagram post, sharing it with her nearly one million followers on the social media network. Here are the exercises she recommends â€“ and some of her other diet and fitness tips.</p><h2>1 Here Is Her "Abs and Core" Workout</h2><p>"I'm holding 5lbs each hand. Holding the dumbbells will help with counterbalance during the V sit. Let's gooo!" she writes in the caption, recommending doing each exercise for 30 seconds and completing the circuit for three sets.<ol><li>Modified v sit Russian twist</li><li>V sit leg crunch</li><li>Glute bridge knee drives</li><li>Lying knee crunch</li><li>Lying flutter kicks</li></ol><figure><img title="1 Here Is Her " abs="" and="" core"="" workout"="" src="IMG/BB1lIAZv_1_here_is_her_abs_and_core_workout.jpg" alt="1 Here Is Her " abs="" and="" core"="" workout"=""><figcaption><em>1 Here Is Her "Abs and Core" Workout.

However, she explains to her followers that it takes patience, a lot of work, and time to do so. "27 years old vs 37 years old with 2 kids," she wrote in the caption. "My transformation didn't take me 10 years to see results. But my progress hasn't been linear either â€“ especially with 2 pregnancies," she writes.</p><figure><img title="2 Be Patient" src="IMG/BB1lIFDA_2_be_patient.jpg" alt="2 Be Patient"><figcaption><em>2 Be Patient.

I've always kept going and I've never given up on myself," she writes in the same post.</p><figure><img title="3 Be Consistent" src="IMG/BB1lIAZF_3_be_consistent.jpg" alt="3 Be Consistent"><figcaption><em>3 Be Consistent.

"If you want to change your body composition by getting lean and adding curves â€“ LIFT WEIGHTS. If you want to build confidence â€“ LIFT WEIGHTS. Cardio isn't going to give you the shape you're looking for," she points out. What are some other reasons to lift weights? The Mayo Clinic adds that strength and weight training help reduce body fat, preserve and increase lean muscle mass, and burn calories more efficiently. It may also help you develop strong bones, manage your weight, enhance your quality of life, manage chronic conditions, and sharpen your thinking skills.</p><figure><img title="4 Strength Train" src="IMG/BB1lIwrQ_4_strength_train.jpg" alt="4 Strength Train"><figcaption><em>4 Strength Train.

Better yet, you don't have to leave your house. "YES it can be done and it's what I've been doing for years," she concludes.</p><h2>6 Eat a Protein Packed Diet</h2><p>Becky emphasizes the importance of eating protein. She herself consumes "2000ish calories and 120ish protein," per day. She designs her meals with a balance of carbs, protein and fats. "I usually eat more on lifting days because I'm hungrier," she explains.</p><p>â€” 2 eggs, 2 egg whites and feta toast with butter: 400 calories/25 protein</p><p>â€” Apple with peanut butter, protein shake:Â 450 calories/35 protein</p><p>â€” Chicken thigh and leg, sweet potato and broccoli:Â 450 calories/45 protein</p><p>â€” Bun with turkey, and orange:Â 350 calories/15 grams protein</p><p>â€“Cucumber salad and cookies:Â 400 caloriesAnd if you enjoyed this article, don't missThis Is Exactly How to Lose Body Fat This Year.</p></main>
