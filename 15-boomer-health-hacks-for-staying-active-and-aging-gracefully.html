    <main><h1>15 Boomer Health Hacks for Staying Active and Aging Gracefully</h1><p>Growing old is no fun, especially if aging takes over prematurely. There are many tested ways for prolonging one’s life, but longevity is nothing without living standards. How can we live longer but still feel and look our best?</p><h2>1. Increase Bone Strength</h2><p>As we age, conditions like osteoporosis and arthritis can become debilitating physical problems and reduce our quality of life. The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends several ways to keep one’s skeleton in working order: balance training, resistance training, and weight-bearing exercises. These steps are easy to do at home with a yoga mat or soft floor space.</p><h2>2. Improve Eyesight</h2><p>We can improve our eye health in several ways, including having regular eye exams, protecting our eyes from UV radiation, and a healthy diet full of vitamins C, E, and omega-3 fatty acids. People who eat lots of coldwater fish and leafy salads have a better chance of prolonging their eyesight into older age.</p><figure><img title="2.

Develop Muscle Mass</h2><p>As we age, we lose a percentage of muscle mass each year — between three percent and five percent per decade on average, according to Harvard Health. You might notice a point in life where exercises that were once easy are now more difficult. Still, there are ways to delay the onset. Weight resistance training (body weight will suffice) is important, as is eating a diet with the right forms of protein for muscle development.</p><h2>4. Keep Healthy Skin</h2><p>Aging is perhaps most reflected in our skin’s appearance — especially our lips. When young, our lips have more natural volume. As we grow older, they get thinner. While the Angelina Jolies of this world have a genetic headstart on most, a collagen-rich diet and moderate sunlight exposure will maintain more youthful skin in later years.</p><h2>5. Work on Flexibility</h2><p>We don’t need any studies to show us how our bodies need constant action — sports lovers and gym nuts often become injured during periods of inactivity. A British Journal of Sports Medicine study found evidence surrounding what’s known as the “Training-Injury Prevention Paradox” model, wherein athletes given heavier training workloads encountered fewer injuries than at lower parameters—staying flexible means using your body in ways outside the usual gym movements: swimming, pilates, and yoga, for example.</p><h2>6. Get More Sleep</h2><p>We all know someone who has experienced sleeplessness — or has raised children, which is even harder. I can’t think of an easier hack to feel young than sleeping and waking daily without the need for an alarm. There are some incredible morning smashers out there: Michelle Obama, Mark Wahlberg, and Ursula Burns, to name a few. The evidence is there for us all: these walking wonders just don’t age. However, for those who need to science their way through life, a Population Reference Bureau study makes a compelling case for why good sleep equals diet or exercise.</p><h2>7. Reduce Your Body Mass Index</h2><p>Metabolism dictates how easily we gain weight, according to how fast the body burns it off, and this naturally slows with each progressing year, especially after 50. Reduced estrogen increases body fat in women, while lower testosterone reduces male muscle development. There is good news: reducing this progression is simple, requiring minimal expenditure — just consistency. Medical News Today outlines how anyone can lower their body mass index (BMI) with a low-carb, high-protein diet, plenty of walking, and a healthy sleep cycle.</p><h2>8. Lower Your Blood Sugar</h2><p>In other sobering news for aging humans, diabetes risks increase as we age, namely for underweight and very obese people regardless of sex, according to an American Diabetes Association report. In more grim news for parents, the potential for diabetes diagnosis is higher in overweight children. Therefore, promoting healthy blood sugar begins at a young age. However, losing weight is the best way to reduce diabetes side effects when we mature.</p><p>My uncle is convinced he got diabetes through shock. He was racing a sports car and crashed, losing consciousness. When he woke up, he tried to open his eyes, but his eyelids were gummed shut — he was convinced the momentary shock of thinking he had lost his eyesight gave his nervous system a negative jolt. It sounds far-fetched, but some evidence may suggest otherwise.</p><h2>9. Maintain Mental Dexterity</h2><p>With three of my four deceased grandparents suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, one could say I am interested in keeping my mind agile. I hate the idea that finishing school ends our relationship with learning. Retiring to a world of daytime game shows, lazy afternoons, and weekend spa visits may sound glamorous, but there’s no substitute for keeping one’s mind alert. Mind-training apps, regular reading, and the simple act of remembering a fact without Google are all simple methods for chasing out brain fog.</p><figure><img title="9.

This simple act of breathing, understanding how your body needs a few moments of daily peace, and adapting to inner rhythms is important. It may come as meditation, deep breathing, or even prayer for the theistic among us. Psychology Today reasons that mindfulness presents a paradox for aging people. The more we need it as we grow older, the harder it is to maintain due to life’s work necessities and obligations.</p><h2>11. Active Financial Planning</h2><p>A harmonious bank balance may be the best step toward achieving age-reducing inner harmony. There’s nothing fun about approaching one’s retirement, knowing financial independence isn’t possible. Beginning an investment or retirement savings plan earlier in adulthood may finance an affluent, long retirement. Mental health struggles and an aging heart are the perfect recipe for no third course in life’s banquet.</p><h2>12. Develop a Positive Mindset</h2><p>Whether you have that financial luck in your career or not, there are always reasons to be thankful, happy, and positive. Growing old and being surrounded by a strong friend network or loving family are human beings’ tried-and-tested ways of entering their twilight years with satisfaction. Furthermore, keeping a strong network of creatures in your life is a good idea. Caring for a pet is a great option if humans aren’t available.</p><figure><img title="12.

Lower Your Toxin Intake</h2><p>The aptly named New York Health Foundation reports that American consumers may be exposed to almost 80,000 harmful chemicals per day, including many in personal beauty, health, and children’s products. In our diet, toxins in antioxidants and preservatives can number in the dozens. Sadly, a toxin-free cosmetology regimen isn’t easy for all makeup users — so-called “clean” products cost more than their cheaper-produced mass-market rivals.</p><h2>14. Fight Cancer</h2><p>Many people will live exceptionally long lives in the coming centuries, but this doesn’t mean cancer will disappear. While there have been marvelous advances in cancer treatments, and while diagnosis isn’t necessarily mitigated by a healthy lifestyle (luck with cell mutations is often the reason, says the University of Utah’s “The Scope” Radio), it doesn’t hurt. Treating your body well with a protein, mineral, and superfood-rich diet is a good base camp. Moreover, healthier ingredients yield more energy, producing better physical and emotional benefits.</p><h2>15. Get Educated, Get Married, Keep Busy</h2><p>Idle hands are never positive in retirement, and losing one’s working routine or motivation can be highly damaging for some. A National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) report titled “The Mortality Effects of Retirement” examined how researchers found a 2% rise in male deaths at 62 years — the age at which Social Security eligibility kicks in. Moreover, the mortality increase was higher for unmarried men and those without a high school diploma. The good news is that the effect wasn’t significant on women in the same cohort.</p><h2>15 Fulfilling Ways Baby Boomers Are Spending Their Golden Years</h2><p>Spending your golden years doing what you want is essential to ending life’s final chapter. These activities don’t have to be unique, with many of these retirement activities being normal-life events you have done plenty of times. While some people go overboard and spend loads of money, others decide to be simplistic and do what they love. Spending your golden years should be fun and active while you can!</p><p class="entry-title">15 Fulfilling Ways Baby Boomers Are Spending Their Golden Years</p><figure><img title="15 Fulfilling Ways Baby Boomers Are Spending Their Golden Years" src="IMG/BB1hZmQy_15_fulfilling_ways_baby_boomers_are_spending_their_golden_years.jpg" alt="15 Fulfilling Ways Baby Boomers Are Spending Their Golden Years"><figcaption><em>15 Fulfilling Ways Baby Boomers Are Spending Their Golden Years.
