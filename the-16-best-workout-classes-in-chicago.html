    <main><h1>The 16 Best Workout Classes In Chicago</h1><p><em>Break a sweat at Rumble</em></p><p>From HIIT and strength training to boxing and yoga, sweat it out at these top workout classes in Chicago. </p><h2><strong>AIR Aerial Fitness</strong></h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website</p><p>With multiple locations across Chicago and the North Shore, AIR classes offer a killer core workout in the form of aerial classes. With classes for all levels, from beginners and kids to advanced, this fun fitness class is a must-try. </p><h2><strong>AKT</strong></h2><p><em>1100 N. Wells St. / </em>Website </p><p>Dance and sweat it out through a full-body workout that fuses cardio intervals with strength and toning exercises. There are four group dance class formats-Dance, Bands, Circuit and Tone-that are all exceptionally effective (and definitely fun) workouts, each ranging from 45 to 60 minutes, and offer both new and experienced clients the benefits of learning the AKT techniques, choreography and dance styles in a low-impact, high-intensity format. </p><h2><strong>Barry's Bootcamp</strong> </h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website</p><p>We love Barry's for its high-intensity interval training, carefully curated playlists, world-class instructors and welcoming community. Barry's signature HIIT workout takes place in the Red Room, a studio full of red light and high energy, while the Double Floor workout is available for those who prefer not to run. Both workouts keep your heart rate elevated, allowing you to burn more calories and increase lean body mass. </p><h2><strong>Bolt</strong></h2><p><em>4545 N. Ravenswood Ave. / </em>Website</p><p>For those looking to build up some serious strength, make tracks to the new Chicago Bolt Fitness facility. With sustainable training systems and expert coaches, the studio provides the tools necessary to level up by enforcing the basic fundamentals while tying in elements of community and creativity. Choose from strength and conditioning classes, or push the limits in a HIIT or speed class.</p><h2><strong>BÜNDA</strong></h2><p><em>1226 N. Wells St. Chicago </em>/ Website</p><p>With locations in Florida, California and Texas, this boutique fitness studio has just entered the Chicago scene with a newly debuted Gold Coast location.

LaSalle Drive / </em>Website</p><p>Get your blood pumping at a high-energy cycling class at CycleBar. With excellent music and motivating lights, this full-body workout will leave you feeling energized to the next level. </p><h2><strong>Reform Studios</strong></h2><p><em>228 E. Illinois St.</em> / Website</p><p>This newly debuted Streeterville Pilates studio offers guided, motivational classes developed by founder Jennifer Villamil, set to uplifting tunes. The boutique also features the innovative Reform RX system (outfitted with a 21.5-inch HD touchscreen and self-guided classes) for a full-body training solution that hones in on strength and cardio.</p><h2><strong>Rise Nation</strong></h2><p><em>667 N. Wells St. / </em>Website</p><p>Chicago may not have mountains to climb, but Rise Nation's Windy City studio offers a space for guests to reach new heights-literally. Through high-intensity, low-impact and self-regulating climbing workouts, Rise Nation's energetic climbing classes are guaranteed to get the heart pumping while the body remains balanced and upright. </p><h2><strong>Ritual Hot Yoga</strong></h2><p><em>750 N. Franklin St. / </em>Website</p><p>"Ritual Hot Yoga delivers a soulful, physically challenging, musically driven practice in 50 minutes that resonates with River North," says studio manager and COO Irene Hodge. </p><h2><strong>Rumble</strong></h2><p><em>11 E. Elm St. / </em>Website</p><p>Half boxing, half weights, Rumble classes at its Gold Coast studio pack a serious punch with motivating music, high-energy instructors and 10 heart-pounding rounds for a full-body workout.</p><h2><strong>Shred 415</strong> </h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website</p><p>Founded in Chicago in 2011, Shred 415 workout classes offer a dynamic fitness experience that combines cardio with strength training for athletes of all levels. </p><h2><strong>[solidcore]</strong> </h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website </p><p>High-intensity, low-impact full-body workouts on a pilates-inspired reformer have made [solidcore] one of the city's most popular workouts. With five locations and a sixth on the way, it's sure to get you hooked after the first class. </p><h2><strong>SoulCycle</strong></h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website</p><p>This full-body workout packs a punch, delivering intense cardio in a 45-minute session (expect to burn from 500-700 calories). Expect the bumping music and rhythmic movements to have you fully addicted within minutes. </p><h2><strong>Studio Three</strong></h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website</p><p>This boutique fitness studio takes pride in its modern, sleek interiors and state-of-the-art fitness technologies. With multiple locations across Chicago, there are always classes available-plus, it's a great spot to make friends with like-minded fitness enthusiasts. </p><h2><strong>The Barre Code</strong></h2><p><em>Multiple locations / </em>Website</p><p>At The Barre Code, passionate instructors lead all-in-one programs (Barre, Bootcamp and Brawl) and create a safe space for participants of all levels, backgrounds and abilities are welcomed and celebrated. </p><h2><strong>Vibez Fit</strong></h2><p><em>664 N. Wells St. / </em>Website</p><p>Offering both in-studio and online classes, Vibez Fit workouts utilize the Power Plate, which speeds up metabolism, activates muscles, builds bone density and more, to enhance the strength, cardio, flexibility and recovery training in classes of just 20 or fewer participants. </p><p>Photography by: Photo courtesy of brands</p></main>
