    <main><h1>Become a Happier Person By Following These 14 Easy Tips</h1><p>Everyone deserves to be truly happy. However, that is easier said than done. It can be hard to be completely at peace with the world and happy with who you are. It can be even harder to deal with modern life while you keep a smile on your face.</p><p>But we have 14 tips that will help you become happier in your day-to-day life. Take a look at these simple tricks to help you feel better, live better, and be a better, happier person.</p><h2>Practice gratitude</h2><p>This step probably seems moot, but it’s one of the easiest to accomplish. We go on about our lives without focusing on the things we’re truly grateful for, like a loving family, close friends, healthy relationships, and so on.</p><p>Practicing gratitude requires time and effort. End your night daily with something you’re grateful for. It can be as menial as buying your favorite beverage or something significant as getting a promotion.</p><figure><img title="Practice gratitude" src="IMG/BB1nGh0O_practice_gratitude.jpg" alt="Practice gratitude"><figcaption><em>Practice gratitude.

Most of us are afraid to take breaks because we believe we can’t afford them, and while that’s true, it’s best to take a break while we can before we are forced to.</p><p>Prioritize your mental and physical health by taking short breaks from work and mundane activities in life. Take breathing breaks if you’re working in the kitchen; stretch your limbs if you’re cooped up in bed, and try to nap whenever possible.</p><h2>Prioritize sleep</h2><p>Most of us grew up believing that 8 hours of sleep is necessary for proper function. While all sleep requirements differ, following the minimum 8-hour rule is the best way to ensure you get enough rest.</p><p>Try to manage your schedule so you won’t succumb to physical and mental exhaustion. Take short naps on your lunch break and steal away from the family to sleep longer on the weekends.</p><figure><img title="Prioritize sleep" src="IMG/BB1mFatg_prioritize_sleep.jpg" alt="Prioritize sleep"><figcaption><em>Prioritize sleep.

Most of us believe managing stress means staying afloat with our problems, but it simply means ensuring you get the best help.</p><p>It’s easy to succumb to stress if we continue to accept it. You can seek a good therapist to help manage mental and environmental pressure. Learn to cater to personal needs and try to prioritize your health first.</p><h2>Limit social media</h2><p>We must admit that social media has drastically limited our happiness. Most of us scroll through unrealistic expectations, compare our personal lives, and often end up with a disheartening result. It is best to take breaks from social media.</p><p>You don’t need to completely cut off ties with social media, but ensure you’re taking breaks to prevent unrealistic idealism. Try to focus on what you have and disconnect from virtual reality when you feel overwhelmed.</p><h2>Be expressive</h2><p>Too many of us shy away from expressing our opinions and feel down and confused. While assessing a situation and speaking accordingly is essential, we must focus on being confident enough to express ourselves.</p><p>Communicate openly with your colleagues, talk with acquaintances, and stay transparent with personal relationships. However, don’t hesitate to draw boundaries where necessary, and ensure you express your concerns and comfort.</p><h2>Learn to say no</h2><p>The biggest problem with society is failing to understand and respect others’ boundaries. While you may be trying to respect your colleagues, family members, or friends’ boundaries, it is equally essential to develop yours.</p><p>Learn to say no to situations that make you feel comfortable. Don’t let people treat you harshly or maintain friendships solely because you seem resourceful. It is okay to excuse yourself from situations that seem uncomfortable.</p><h2>Balance opposites</h2><p>Most of us see the world in two parallels: introvertism and extrovertism. However, it is essential to maintain balance in life. If you’re an introvert, try to be more expressive and communicative, and stay a little reserved if you’re an extrovert.</p><p>Balancing your personality is essential because it shapes how people interact with you. Oversharing and being too talkative may hinder your relationship with others, just like staying too closed/reserved will put them off.</p><figure><img title="Balance opposites" src="IMG/BB1nxzPK_balance_opposites.jpg" alt="Balance opposites"><figcaption><em>Balance opposites.

While seeking therapy is essential, one little trick may help you feel better: reshaping memories. This will create a positive impact overall.</p><p>Try to laugh at situations that once brought you pain. Instead of thinking you were broken up with, believe you dodged a bullet. Instead of remembering that you tripped on your laces, focus on what would have happened if you hadn’t.</p><h2>Manage guilt</h2><p>One of the most basic human emotions is remorse and guilt. We might feel guilty about situations we had or didn’t have complete control over, which is exceptionally normal. It’s okay to manage guilt as long as it doesn’t impede character growth.</p><p>Learn to let things go if those involved have moved on as well. Try to seek forgiveness for things you haven’t, but don’t beat yourself up if things feel awkward. Lastly, don’t blame yourself for situations outside your control.</p><h2>Be zen</h2><p>We’ve seen influencers raving about connecting with Mother Nature and feeling at peace. You, too, can be zen with nature if you know how to manage the connection and keep it strong.</p><p>You can start with small habits or hobbies like taking care of potted plants. Move onto more prominent sources of interacting with nature, like nature trails and walks, when you’ve gotten used to being comfortable with elements of nature.</p><h2>Stay connected</h2><p>As much as some of us would like to keep to ourselves, interacting with society is essential to life. You don’t have to take things too far to ensure you’re connected; keep up with more minor achievements and milestones.</p><p>Congratulations to your neighbor on their child’s graduation. Try to include a new coworker at your lunch table. Check in on your friends every few weeks. Take little steps of connection to stay in contact at a healthy pace.</p><h2>Find Alone Time</h2><p>Many of us are surrounded by people every day. From those we work with to our family and friends, there are always people around. It is important to remember to take some time to be alone. </p><p>When you are by yourself, you can tune in to your personal feelings a little better. You can take some quiet time to really get in touch with your own body, mind, and soul. Being alone is just as important as socialization.</p><figure><img title="Find Alone Time" src="IMG/BB1nSlTL_find_alone_time.jpg" alt="Find Alone Time"><figcaption><em>Find Alone Time.

Whether it is running, baking, crafting, or reading, find something that brings you joy, and be sure to practice it as often as possible. </p><p>Having a hobby will prevent boredom and can even help fight depression. Having more than one favorite pastime is even better!</p></main>
