While it's convenient to grab a box of popsicles from the freezer aisle, making them from scratch is much a healthier option. On top of this, you only need three ingredients to whip up homemade popsicles in just 5 minutes. Keep reading to learn how to prepare popsicles as a healthy and refreshing summertime treat!</p><h2>The scoop on store-bought popsicles</h2><p>Take a quick look at the ingredients list on a box of popsicles and you'll likely see high fructose corn syrup, sugar, artificial flavors and colored dyes. These ingredients give the popsicles their sugary flavor and eye-catching color. However, they also make commercial popsicles a treat you should indulge in every now and then. The good news: You don't have to settle for the store-bought kind since you can easily make them yourself.</p><h2>Why you should make your own popsicles </h2><p>Making popsicles at home puts you in control of the ingredients. You won't be consuming any added sugar or high fructose corn syrup, which are associated with increased inflammation and weight gain. A natural sweetener like honey is the perfect sugar swap because it's packed with antioxidants that help boost gut health and reduce cholesterol. Balance the honey's sweetness by adding fresh lemon juice. It will give your popsicles a citrusy zing and deliver a dose of immune-boosting vitamin C to boot. These ingredients, along with water, are all you need to make healthy and refreshing popsicles. </p><h2>An easy and healthy recipe for homemade popsicles</h2><p>This recipe for 3-Ingredient Honey and Lemon Popsicles comes from 30seconds.com. A popsicle mold like Chuzy Chef's Popsicle Ice Mold Maker Set fits six popsicles - enough to make one batch of this recipe. Be sure to stash any leftover popsicles in your freezer to pull out whenever you're craving a frozen treat to beat the heat. (These Cottage Cheese Popsicles are another healthy option that delivers a nice dose of protein.)</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><strong>Active:</strong><strong>Total time:</strong><strong>Yield: </strong><h2>Bonus trick for extra flavorful popsicles </h2><p>While the sweet and tart flavors of these popsicles are appetizing, you can customize the ingredients to your liking.

Additionally, fresh berries or mint can be added to the popsicle base for a boost of naturally sweetness.
