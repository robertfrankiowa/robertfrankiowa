    <main><h1>11 Foods That May Help You Sleep</h1><p><p>A registered dietitian explains foods and nutrients that may support sleep</p><strong>Medically reviewed by Suzanne Fisher, RD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Suzanne Fisher, RD</strong><p>Quality and restful sleep are essential for recovery, memory and learning, and participation in daily activities. Moreover, healthy sleep patterns are crucial for health because poor sleep contributes to chronic conditions.</p><p>Diet plays an integral role in sleep. Foods rich in essential minerals like magnesium, calcium, iron, and potassium help the body and mind relax. Adding these nutrients to your evening routine improves sleep quality. </p><p>The following article explores foods that help you sleep, highlighting specific nutrients and ways to integrate them into your daily routine.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pLy0w_washing_fresh_cherries_at_a_shiny_metal_sink.jpg" alt="Washing fresh cherries at a shiny metal sink"><figcaption><em>Gabriela Tulian / Getty Images Washing fresh cherries at a shiny metal sink.

Maintaining adequate calcium levels helps with falling and staying asleep. Additionally, calcium’s role in nerve signaling contributes to its effect on sleep. Calcium regulates brain waves that occur during the restful phase of sleep (non-rapid eye movement sleep).</p><p>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provides the following recommended intakes for calcium:</p><ul><li><strong>Females 19 to 50 years</strong>: 1,000 milligrams (mg) daily</li><li><strong>Females 51 and older</strong>: 1,200 mg daily</li><li><strong>Males 19 and older</strong>: 1,000 mg daily </li></ul><p>Dairy products, fatty fish with bones, and certain vegetables like kale and bok choy naturally have calcium. A 3.5-ounce serving of nonfat plain Greek yogurt has 111 mg of calcium. One cup of cooked spinach provides 245 mg of calcium. </p><p>Other foods, such as orange juice and non-dairy milks, are fortified with calcium. One cup of fortified soy milk provides nearly 300 mg of calcium.</p><p>Sip on a glass of soy milk or milk before bedtime to help with sleep. Serve cooked spinach as your vegetable at dinner, or make a Greek yogurt-based sauce or dressing.</p><h2>Iron-Rich Foods</h2><p>The mineral iron carries oxygen throughout the body and supports normal cell function. Iron deficiency is associated with poor sleep, insomnia, and sleep apnea. </p><p>It is unclear exactly how iron affects sleep. However, researchers believe iron’s role in neurotransmitter production influences its effect on sleep.</p><p>Research shows that iron deficiency also contributes to restless leg syndrome, which causes intense urges to move the legs. Restless legs syndrome affects sleep quality. Supplementing with iron reduces symptoms of restless leg syndrome and may improve sleep quality, but additional research is necessary.</p><p>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends the following daily iron intake for adults:</p><ul><li><strong>Females 19 to 50</strong>: 18 mg of iron daily</li><li><strong>Females 51 and older</strong>: 8 mg of iron daily</li><li><strong>Males 19 and older</strong>: 8 mg of iron daily  </li></ul><p>Iron exists in animal and plant foods. A 3.5-ounce flank steak has almost 2 mg of iron. One cup of cooked lentils provides 6.5 mg of iron, and a 3.5-ounce serving of raw pumpkin seeds has 8 mg.</p><p>Alternate between steak and lentils for meat and meatless dinners. Add pumpkin seeds to salads, soups, and bowls, or munch on a homemade trail mix before bedtime.  </p><h2>Cherries</h2><p>Tart cherries are a good source of melatonin, a hormone important for sleep. Melatonin levels fluctuate depending on the time of day. Melatonin is higher in the evening to facilitate sleep and lower in the morning to help wake up. </p><p>Eating foods rich in melatonin increases melatonin in the body. Research shows that eating tart cherries or drinking tart cherry juice raises melatonin levels to improve sleep quality and reduce insomnia.</p><p>Daytime and artificial light inhibit the body’s ability to produce melatonin. Instead, snack on cherries or drink tart cherry juice in the evening when it is dark to help raise the body’s melatonin production.</p><p>Prepare a cherry crisp with oats and almonds for an evening treat, or make a yogurt and cherry parfait to help boost melatonin levels.</p><h2>Oats</h2><p>Oats are a great source of fiber and other nutrients beneficial for sleep, like iron, calcium, and magnesium. A half-cup serving of oats contains 10 grams (g) of fiber and more than 4 mg of iron. </p><p>The glycemic index reflects how much a food raises blood sugar. High-glycemic foods cause a surge in blood sugar, followed by the release of insulin to remove the sugar from the bloodstream. </p><p>However, insulin release sometimes causes blood sugar to dip too low (hypoglycemia). When this occurs, the body compensates by releasing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline to increase blood sugar. These fluctuations in blood sugar affect sleep quality.</p><p>Oats are a low-glycemic food, meaning they have less impact on blood sugar. The high fiber content of oats helps keep blood sugar stable, preventing any fluctuations throughout the night that can affect sleep and cause you to wake up more throughout the night. </p><p>When purchasing oats, opt for steel cut or rolled oats, which are less processed and higher in fiber. Use oats to make energy bites or a fruit crisp. Top oatmeal with bananas and almonds for an evening snack.</p><h2>Fiber-Rich Whole Grains</h2><p>Whole grains have the entire grain kernel, so the bran, germ, and endosperm. Whole grains are higher in nutrients than refined grains, which are stripped of the bran and germ.</p><p>Whole grains include brown rice, barley, bulgur, quinoa, oatmeal, and products made from whole wheat flour. Conversely, white bread, pasta, rice, and other products made from white flour are considered refined grains.</p><p>Refined grains are associated with lighter sleep and waking up more throughout the night. Unlike refined grains, whole grains are rich in fiber. A high-fiber diet is linked to more restorative sleep and improved sleep quality. </p><p>Notably, among postmenopausal women (people in the time of life after menopause, when the menstrual cycle has permanently stopped), a diet rich in whole grains instead of refined grains is associated with lower rates of insomnia. </p><p>Swap regular pasta, bread, or bagels for whole-grain versions. Cook whole wheat pasta with ground turkey and spinach for a sleep-enhancing dinner. For a bedtime snack, try whole wheat toast with almond butter or whole grain cereal with milk and bananas.</p><h2>Bananas</h2><p>Bananas are a great source of potassium, the most abundant intracellular mineral. It exists in all tissues throughout the body and regulates organ function, muscle contraction, and signaling between nerve cells (neurons). One banana contains 375 milligrams of potassium.</p><p>According to one study in humans, potassium levels fluctuate based on circadian rhythms. Changes in potassium levels may reflect nerve and brain cell activity that occurs with sleep and wakefulness. </p><p>However, despite these natural fluctuations, lower potassium concentrations are associated with worsened sleep quality.</p><p>Enjoy bananas as an after-dinner treat to support sleep. Blend and freeze bananas for an ice cream alternative. Dip bananas in peanut butter and chocolate, then freeze for a sweeter treat. Add bananas to cereal or mix into a smoothie for a more filling evening snack.</p><h2>Almonds</h2><p>Almonds contain sleep-enhancing nutrients like potassium, calcium, magnesium, tryptophan, and melatonin. A 3.5-ounce serving of raw, whole almonds has more than 250 mg of calcium and magnesium and more than 700 mg of potassium.</p><p>The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet) emphasizes foods rich in potassium and magnesium. One study found that the high potassium content of the DASH diet reduced sleepiness and sleep issues among women. </p><p>Moreover, consuming foods high in potassium, magnesium, and fiber improves sleep quality in women. </p><p>Add almonds to salads, or use chopped or ground almonds to crust fish or chicken dishes. Make your own trail mix with almonds, or add almonds to any baked goods.</p><h2>Herbal Teas</h2><p>Sipping on tea can be a calming and relaxing ritual. Herbal teas that contain valerian root, lemon balm, and chamomile confer additional relaxation benefits that encourage sleep.</p><p>Herbal teas like valerian root, lemon balm, and chamomile act on the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) to facilitate and improve sleep quality. GABA is the primary neurotransmitter that regulates sleep.</p><p>Valerian root is an herbal supplement traditionally used as a sedative. Regularly drinking valerian root tea may help you fall asleep more quickly and improve sleep quality and deep sleep. </p><p>Chamomile tea has been used as a tranquilizer for thousands of years. It relaxes the body and improves sleep quality.</p><p>Traditional medicine uses lemon balm for digestive issues and anxiety. Its compounds treat insomnia and encourage better sleep overall.</p><p>Pour boiling water over loose tea or tea bags and let the tea steep according to the package. Most herbal teas require at least three to four minutes of steeping. Steep longer or decrease the amount of water for a more concentrated tea. Conversely, shorten the brew time or dilute the tea with more water for a milder flavor. </p><p>Be mindful of drinking too much liquid close to bedtime, which may cause waking in order to urinate.</p><h2>Turkey</h2><p>Tryptophanis a protein (amino acid) in turkey that is responsible for making people sleepy. The body breaks down tryptophan into melatonin, causing you to feel tired after eating large portions of turkey.</p><p>Tryptophan crosses the blood-brain barrier to release the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is then converted into melatonin.</p><p>A 3-ounce turkey breast contains 0.24 mg of tryptophan. Pair turkey breast with a whole-grain carbohydrate like farro or bulgur for a tryptophan boost. Consuming tryptophan with carbohydrates allows more to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in greater melatonin production.</p><p>To reap the sleep benefits of tryptophan, make a turkey sandwich with whole grain bread or a turkey wrap with a whole wheat tortilla.</p><h2>Fatty Fish</h2><p>Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Omega-3s and vitamin D are important for serotonin production and melatonin levels. </p><p>Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids are linked to falling asleep faster, sleeping longer, and better sleep quality. Notably, the omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) affects sleep by influencing the body’s production of melatonin. </p><p>Vitamin D receptors in the brain regulate sleep, so it is crucial to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels for good sleep. According to one meta-analysis, a vitamin D deficiency defined as less than 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) increases the risk of poor sleep by nearly 60%. </p><p>Make a salmon dip and eat it with whole wheat crackers, or top a salad with grilled salmon or canned sardines. Eating the bones in sardines is safe and provides calcium for additional sleep support.</p><h2>Leafy Greens</h2><p>Leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale are good magnesium, potassium, and calcium sources. Magnesium is a micronutrient essential for numerous reactions in the body. One cup of cooked spinach has nearly 160 mg of magnesium. One cup of cooked kale has 45 mg of magnesium. </p><p>Magnesium helps people fall asleep faster and increases sleep duration. Magnesium regulates certain neurotransmitters and the stress hormone cortisol to facilitate relaxation and reduce stress in the brain and body. </p><p>Maintaining adequate magnesium levels is vital. Animal research shows that a magnesium deficiency lowers melatonin levels, negatively impacting sleep.</p><p>Research in humans indicates that higher magnesium concentrations are associated with the recommended sleep time of seven to nine hours nightly. Moreover, according to some studies, people with better sleep quality have higher magnesium levels.</p><p>Enjoy a side salad of spinach or kale with your dinner, or saute leafy greens to pair with your main dish. Leafy greens make a great addition to smoothies, soups, stews, or pasta dishes.</p><p><p>If you've attended to your sleep hygiene, gotten enough exercise, tried to modify your diet, and are still having trouble sleeping, check with your healthcare provider. This is especially important if you've had trouble sleeping for more than two weeks.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Changing your diet may improve your sleep. Leafy greens, fatty fish, almonds, bananas, cherries, turkey, and whole grains contain nutrients that encourage sleep. </p><p>Consider eating sleep-enhancing foods and pairing them together to help even more with sleep. For example, make oatmeal with milk, bananas, cherries, and almonds for a bedtime snack.</p><p>Check with your healthcare provider if you're having trouble sleeping for more than two weeks.</p>
