    <main><h1>10 Resistance Band Exercises That Will Tone & Sculpt Your Entire Body</h1><p>Resistance bands are a sneaky good tool to help you transform your physique, which is why we have 10 of the best resistance band exercises to tone your body. But why are resistance bands "sneaky good?" They're an extremely underrated (and unassuming) tool to help you sculpt an amazing body and change your physique. Of course, they offer resistance so you challenge your muscles and get them to grow. But the unique thing is the "strength curve," which is a fancy way of saying that the resistance increases as the band stretches. This is an unbeatable way to train your explosiveness and power because you'll have to push or pull harder as you do each repetition. They can even help assist you if you struggle with an exercise because they give you a bit of support through the movement.</p><p>Finally, exercise bands come in all kinds of lengths and strengths so you can get the perfect resistance for your exercise or experience level. They're also super lightweight and tiny so you can easily pack them into your suitcase, backpack, or gym bag and get a great workout at your home, a hotel, a park, or any gym.</p><p>Below, you'll find 10 incredible resistance band exercises to tone your body. Feel free to add these to your routine or use them instead of your traditional barbell or dumbbell exercises to switch things up and develop more explosiveness!</p><h2>1. Band Pushups, 4 sets, 12 reps</h2><p>Using a resistance band is a great way to upgrade the traditional pushup. Not only does it help you build more strength in your upper body, but because it gets more challenging as you rise, it'll build more explosiveness.</p><p>With the resistance band in both hands, place the loop behind your back. Get in a pushup position with your hands about shoulder-width apart. Keep your lower back flat and your hips in line with your shoulders. Lower yourself, and keep your elbows close to your body as you descend. Push up, and repeat.</p><h2>2. Band Bent-Over Row, 4 sets, 12 reps</h2><p>Almost everyone should do more pulling exercises for the upper body than pushing exercises. That's because exercise pulling exercises—like rows—strengthen the muscles in your upper back to help realign your posture and keep your shoulders happy.</p><p>Stand on a resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart and with one end in each hand. Bend your knees slightly, and bend at your hips until your torso is almost parallel to the ground. Keep your lower back flat, squeeze your shoulder blades together, and row.</p><h2>3. Band Squats, 4 sets, 10 reps</h2><p>Stand on one end of a resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart with your toes slightly out, and hold the handles up by your shoulders. Start the movement by sitting backward and spreading your knees apart. Descend below parallel while keeping your lower back flat. At the bottom, drive through your heels and keep your knees apart.</p><figure><img title="3. Band Squats, 4 sets, 10 reps" src="IMG/AA1k8HF4_3_band_squats_4_sets_10_reps.jpg" alt="3.

Band Good Morning, 4 sets, 10 reps</h2><p>Trust me—if you're doing these correctly, there's nothing "good" about it. But even so, it's an incredible exercise that strengthens your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back.</p><p>Stand on one end of a band with your feet hip-width apart, and place the other end of the band behind your neck with the loop in front of your body. Push your hips backward with a slight knee bend, keep your back neutral, and descend until your torso is almost parallel to the ground. Drive through your heels and return to the start position.</p><figure><img title="4. Band Good Morning, 4 sets, 10 reps" src="IMG/AA1e3TgY_4_band_good_morning_4_sets_10_reps.jpg" alt="4.

Band Pull Aparts, 3 sets, 15 reps</h2><p>Grab an exercise band about shoulder-width apart held at chest height. Keep your elbows locked. Start by squeezing your shoulder blades together, and pull the band apart until your arms open 180 degrees. Do not arch your back.</p><h2>6. Band Assisted Pull-ups, 4 sets, AMAP (as many as possible)</h2><p>Loop one end of an exercise band around a pull-up bar, and pull it through itself. Grab a pull-up bar with your palms facing away, and place your bent knees in the bottom loop of the band so it gives you support. Start by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Pull yourself up, and lead with your chest.</p><figure><img title="6.

Band Bicep Curls, 3 sets, 20 to 30 reps</h2><p>Stand on an exercise band, and grab the ends with your hands. Curl the bands without swinging your body or leaning backward.</p><h2>8. Band Tricep Pulldowns, Sets: 3, Reps: 20 to 30 reps</h2><p>Attach a light band to a sturdy overhead object, and grasp an end with both hands. Pin your upper arms at your sides, and extend your elbows to lockout.</p><figure><img title="8.

Band Facepulls, Sets: 3, Reps: 15</h2><h2>10. Band Pallof Press, Sets: 3, Reps: 10 each direction (with 3-second pause)</h2><p>Secure an exercise band to chest height. While facing perpendicular to the band's anchor point, grab the band with both hands, and hold it at your chest. Brace your core, and squeeze your glutes. Push the band straight forward, and hold for three seconds. Bring it back to your chest, and repeat. Then, switch sides and repeat.</p></main>
