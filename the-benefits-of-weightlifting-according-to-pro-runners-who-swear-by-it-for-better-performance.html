    <main><h1>The Benefits of Weightlifting, According to Pro Runners Who Swear By It for Better Performance</h1><p>When writer, runner, and group fitness instructor Haley Shapley prepared to climb Mount Rainier several years ago, she focused primarily on endurance training. She made it to the top, felt proud of her accomplishment, and even raised money for charity. </p><p>Then, not long afterward, she started strength training—and immediately wished she’d done so sooner. “When I would go on hard hikes, it was so much easier; I had so much more leg strength,” she tells <em>Runner’s World</em>. Her hiking buddies even noticed the difference: “They were like, ‘You are moving with more ease and you are so much more confident in your body. You’re just a different person.’”</p><p>Reflecting on it now, Shapley isn’t surprised that she’d shied away from lifting in the past, but she realized how picking up heavy things empowered her. As she details in her recent book <em>Strong Like Her: A Celebration of Rule Breakers, History Makers, and Unstoppable Athletes</em><em>, </em>out in paperback this month, women have faced cultural and logistical obstacles to all types of athletic endeavors, especially those that might (gasp!) build muscle.</p><p>“There are a lot of things that have kept women out of the strength world,” Shapley says, including a fear of becoming “bulky.” “We’re supposed to be small. We’re not supposed to take up a lot of space. If you go outside of those bounds, then you’re often considered not ladylike.”</p><p>In her book, Shapley details the stories of trailblazing women who upended those sorts of stereotypes in all different sports, from pedestrianism (an early form of race-walking) to swimming to strength-based sports like strongwoman.</p><p>Of course, today’s elite female runners owe a debt to pioneers like early Boston marathoners Kathrine Switzer and Bobbi Gibb, whose stories Shapley covers. But their current training protocols, most of which involve time in the weight room, also harken back to other groundbreaking athletes in the book—those like Abbye ‘Pudgy’ Stockton, a queen of California’s Muscle Beach in the 1930s and 1940s.</p><p>Stockton performed astonishing feats, including chest-pressing a barbell with a man standing on top of it or balancing on someone’s hands while pressing 100 pounds above her head. And, Shapley says, she did it all with a smile and an encouraging air. “Women looked at her and thought, ‘Wow, that is something I could do,’” Shapley says.</p><p>When women do try lifting weights, they often find a power that transcends sports and fitness. “As women test their limits and push their capabilities, I think they realize that they have so much strength that they didn’t know they had,” Shapley says. “When you lift more weight than you thought you could, you’re infused with this understanding that you can do hard things and you’re able to take that and apply it to other aspects of your life.”</p><p>In addition to a deep historical dive, Shapley’s book features stunning photographs of modern-day athletes. Inspired by those images and the book’s message, <em>Runner’s World </em>asked nine elite women runners what strong means to them, and how their muscle powers them down the track, road, or trail. Here’s what they told us.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Nia Akins </h2><p class="body-tip">2023 U.S. champion in the 800 meters, indoors and outdoors, and pro runner with the Brooks Beasts</p><p><em> “This might be a little counterintuitive, but to me, strength means embracing vulnerability. In the race, the last 100 meters are especially vulnerable, and you have to practice that. So it’s embracing that vulnerability in training and sticking it out when it’s hard.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: I’m in the weight room twice a week, for an hour to an hour and a half. We do it the same day we have harder track sessions, so we’re recovering from everything all at once. For most of our movements, we don’t lift heavy at all. It’s more about being lighter and quicker.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: There are a lot of rehabilitative-type exercises within our strength routine, things that prevent common running injuries. For me, as a middle-distance runner, we focus on explosiveness. I take lifting seriously because I know that’s that 0.001 percent difference, having that strength and being able to call on that explosiveness.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Move: </h4><p><strong>Landmine Press:</strong></p><ol><li>Stand facing a landmine, feet staggered with right foot back, leg straight and left foot forward, knee slightly bent. Hold the end of the barbell in right hand at shoulder. Pack shoulders down and back. </li><li>Engage core, lean slightly forward from ankles and press barbell overhead, bicep by ear. </li><li>With control, lower the barbell back to shoulder.</li><li>Repeat. </li><li>Then switch sides.</li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Jacky Hunt-Broersma</h2><p class="body-tip">Professional trail and ultrarunner for Altra; Guinness World Record holder for running 104 marathons in 104 days</p><figure><img title="Courtesy Edwin Broersma" src="IMG/AA1nIYhI_jacky_hunt_broersma_2_credit_edwin_broersmajpg.jpg" alt="Jacky Hunt-Broersma 2 (credit Edwin Broersma).jpg"><figcaption><em>a women does a one legged kettlebell deadlift. Courtesy Edwin Broersma</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>“Strength is being resilient. It’s showing up every day and never giving up. Strength training makes me a better athlete.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: I prefer using lighter weights and doing movements like plank, deadlifts, bench presses, and push-ups. I use my resistance band for things like clamshells.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: It makes me a better runner and helps me stay injury-free</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Moves: </h4><p><strong>Single-Leg Bridge: </strong></p><ol><li>Lie face up with knees bent and feet planted. Lift right foot off floor, knee bent and in line with left. Arms down by sides. This is the starting position. </li><li>Drive left foot into floor, engage core, and lift hips up toward ceiling, engaging glutes. </li><li>Slowly lower back down to starting position. </li><li>Repeat.</li><li>Then switch sides.</li></ol><p>Also, planking is always so hard but I feel so strong after I’ve done it. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Rachel Tomajczyk</h2><p class="body-tip">Merrell athlete, pro trail runner, and 2023 XTERRA Trail Run World Champion in the 21K half marathon</p><figure><img title="Courtesy Rachel Tomajczyk" src="IMG/AA1nIYhP_rachel_tomajczyk_1_courtsey_of_rachel_tomajczykjpg.jpg" alt="Rachel Tomajczyk 1 (courtsey of Rachel Tomajczyk).jpg"><figcaption><em>a woman doing a deadlift in a gym. Courtesy Rachel Tomajczyk</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>“Strength, to me, means feeling powerful and confident while I’m running. It gives me that extra 1 percent I need to reach my potential when I’m racing.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: Typically, I strength train twice a week for about 30 to 45 minutes per session. I focus on powerful movements such as deadlifts, squats, hamstring curls, quad extensions, calf raises, lunges, and step-ups. I’ll do a few minutes of resistance band exercises to warm up and activate my muscles each day before running—but for me, it’s important to lift heavy and use big weights when I’m in the gym for strength training sessions.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: Strength training prevents injuries—especially stress fractures, any runner’s worst nightmare—and enhances my running form so I’m efficient as I run.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Move:</h4><p>The deadlift activates and strengthens your most powerful running muscles: your hamstrings, glutes, hips, and quads. I always use a hex bar, so the weight is distributed evenly around my body and there is less strain on my back.</p><p><strong>Deadlift:</strong></p><ol><li>Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a barbell or two heavy dumbbells down in front of you. (Or if you have a hex bar, stand in the middle of it, grabbing the sides.) Pack shoulders down and back and engage core.</li><li>Hinge at hips by sending glutes straight back, maintaining just a slight bend in knees. Aim to lower torso about parallel to floor. </li><li>Drive through feet to stand back up, engaging glutes. </li><li>Repeat. </li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Nell Rojas</h2><p class="body-tip">Top American in the Boston Marathon in 2021 and 2022, Nike runner, and coach at RISE</p><p><em>“Strength is the foundation I keep having to come back to. Being strong physically correlates to being strong mentally, too. What I’ve found works for me is this principle of being strong before anything else; I can layer speed, I can layer fitness on top of strength.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: I have two big strength workouts a week, typically on my hard workout days. They start with mobility and muscle recruitment; then, I’ll do some plyometrics. Next is one heavy lift, either squats or deadlifts, to recruit more muscles and gain strength. Then I’ll do a single-leg movement, also pretty heavy. The rest of my movements on top of those are basically for muscle conditioning, helping lactate shuttle through running muscles. Two other days a week, if I have the energy, it will be a core and mobility day.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: When I’m strong, every single step I take—which in a marathon, is many, many steps—is that much more powerful and produces that much more force. The effort level of running at any speed, especially anything faster, is lower. Plus, my body feels the best; it has the most energy.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Move: </h4><p>Heavy squats and deadlifts. When I’m consistent with them, my hormones work better, I sleep better—everything goes better in my life.</p><p><strong>Squat</strong>:</p><ol><li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes turned slightly out. Hold heavy dumbbells racked at shoulders, elbows bent, or with a barbell placed on back of shoulders, behind hand, with hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. </li><li>Lower hips down and back, bending knees. Aim to get hips just below knees. Keep core engaged and chest upright; make sure knees track over toes.</li><li>Drive through feet to stand back up. </li><li>Repeat. </li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Chari Hawkins</h2><p class="body-tip">Brooks athlete, 2022 national champion in pentathlon, 2024 World Championship finalist in heptathlon</p><p><em>“When a lot of people think of strength, they think of the ‘lack’ of weakness. The only issue with that is that it isn’t real, it isn’t human. To me, strength is the act of continuing to show up in dark moments, in hardships, in weaknesses.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine: </strong>We go to the gym three times a week, focusing on a mix of movements with both bodyweight and weights, to help me progress in the heptathlon. We don’t shy away from pushing heavy weights, but it’s all about building that functional strength that translates to the track so that we can peak at the right time. I have an amazing strength coach, two-time Olympian, Sheila Burrell.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running: </strong>I am constantly using the strength and stability I get in the gym to help me with my performance on the track, but I use the system of strength-building in every aspect of my life: Each piece of resistance makes me stronger.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Move: </h4><p>The power clean and coming out of the starting blocks. Power cleans train your glutes, hamstrings, and quads—the power trio for explosive movements that help me with sprinting, jumping, and throwing. Coming out of the starting blocks encompasses full-body strength and discipline.</p><p><strong>Power Clean:</strong></p><ol><li>Place loaded barbell on the floor in front of you. Stand with feet hip-width apart, core engaged. </li><li>Hinge at hips by sending glutes straight back, back flat, bending knees. Grab the bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. </li><li>Pull the bar straight up, close to body, and at the same time, explosively push feet into ground to initiate the stand up. </li><li>After barbell reaches knees, extend hips, continue pulling barbell upward, and as it reaches belly button, get underneath the barbell, elbows now pointing forward and palms facing ceiling. At the same time, lower hips into a shallow squat position. </li><li>Stand up, extending hips and knees. </li><li>Slowly and with control, lower the barbell back to the floor, hinging at hips. </li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Kayley Delay</h2><p class="body-tip">Six-time Ivy League champion in track at Yale University, finalist in the 2021 Olympic Trials for the steeplechase, and pro runner with the Brooks Beasts</p><p><em>“To me, strength means the relative ability to handle something. It may be relative to yourself, someone else, or societal expectations, and the ‘something’ can be anything that is testing your capability. But when I think of strength in regards to running, the word ‘toughness’ comes to mind.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: We lift twice a week for roughly an hour or so on workout days, typically Tuesday and Friday. We do a handful of bodyweight exercises in combination with using dumbbells or kettlebells. Typically, our lift includes three supersets with three or four exercises in each set. Generally, I would say our routine is on the lighter end with a good bit of reps.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: Not only is strength training great for injury prevention, but it also adds power and strength to your stride. It can help you run more efficiently by improving your biomechanics. </p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Move: </h4><p>Dumbbell step-ups are pretty easy to do anywhere. I remember during COVID—when I couldn’t go to a gym—getting some dumbbells and doing the exercise using a kitchen chair.</p><p><strong>Dumbbell Step-Ups: </strong></p><ol><li>Stand in front of a box, step, or low chair, holding a dumbbell in each hand down by dies.</li><li>Place right foot on top of a box and left foot on the ground. Step up onto the box by driving weight through the right foot, keeping knee over laces, body traveling directly upward.</li><li>Drive left knee up toward chest at the top.</li><li>Slowly lower back down.</li><li>Repeat.</li><li>Then switch sides.</li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Neely Gracey</h2><p class="body-tip">Olympic Trials qualifying marathoner, Guinness World Record holder in the stroller mile, coach, and author of <em>Breakthrough Women’s Running</em></p><p><em>“When I think of strength, I think of resilience and confidence.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: I aim to lift twice a week for 30 minutes, combining methods from heavy deadlifting with a hex bar to band work. I like dumbbells and plyometrics and often use machines as well. I enjoy having a program to follow and I work with coach Bridget McGahen from VectorStrength.com for a personalized strength program delivered via an app. </p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: I feel better running when I am lifting consistently. I can stack more healthy miles with more pop in my step. I also like seeing the quick progress I can make with lifting routinely—it’s motivating and shows the work is working.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Moves: </h4><p>Box jumps for fun, but I feel like I get the most out of deadlifts. I also like dumbbell bicep curls because I imagine running and pumping my arms to kick it in at the end of a race.</p><p><strong>Box Jump:</strong></p><ol><li>Start with a low box, like a step. (As you progress, increase the height.) </li><li>Squat down, then jump up with both feet onto the top of the box. </li><li>Squeeze glutes and extend knees and hips to stand up on the box. </li><li>Step back down, one foot at a time. </li><li>Repeat.</li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Sally McRae</h2><p class="body-tip">Trail and ultrarunner for Nike, champion of the 2021 Badwater 135 and the 2023 Triple Crown of 200-mile races, creator of the Sally McRae Strength app, and co-host of a podcast and author of a book both called <em>Choose Strong.</em></p><figure><img title="Courtesy Sally McRae" src="IMG/AA1nJ9XJ_sally_mcrae_courtesy_sally_mcraejpg.jpg" alt="Sally McRae (courtesy Sally McRae).jpg"><figcaption><em>a woman does a lift with a dumbbell. Courtesy Sally McRae</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>“At some point in all of our lives, we hit storms and valleys and massive mountains we have to climb. To get through those things takes strength. Strength is not just for the talented, the pro athletes, people with chiseled bodies—I believe our greatest strength is between our two ears.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: Strength is an important part of my program year-round, but it changes with the phases of my training. In the off season, I lift heavy five to six days a week to build a strong foundation. As I get closer to a particular race, my strength training becomes more supplementary to my running workouts. That means at least three times a week, but shorter sessions with a focus on PT-style exercises—bodyweight exercises, bands, and dumbbells.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: I learned early on that in ultra and trail running, many variables go into being successful in the sport. It’s not just how fast you can run a mile—you have to be able to endure for 10, 20, 60 hours on your feet. Strength can’t be overlooked. As I moved through the sport, I started to realize that strength training played a significant role in keeping me injury-free. I haven’t had an injury in over a decade.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Favorite Moves: </h4><p>Deadlifting and Bulgarian split squats, as well as any type of single-leg movement, whether it’s stepping onto a box from one foot or sitting on a box and coming to a standing position on one leg.</p><p><strong>Bulgarian Split Squat:</strong> </p><ol><li>Stand in front of a box, chair, or step, about at knee height. Place right foot on box behind you. Hold a dumbbell in each hand down by sides. This is the starting position.</li><li>Lean slightly forward at hips and with left front foot planted firmly on ground, take an inhale and bend left leg to lower toward floor. Lower until back knee hovers just above the floor or as close to it as you can go while keeping left knee tracking over toes.</li><li>Exhale and drive left foot into floor to stand up, straightening front leg.</li><li>Repeat.</li><li>Then switch sides.</li></ol><h2 class="body-h2">Emily Durgin</h2><p class="body-tip">Pro runner for Adidas; 2024 U.S. 10-Mile champion; ninth-place finisher at the 2024 Olympic Marathon Trials</p><figure><img title="Cole Burston - Getty Images" src="IMG/AA1nIYic_gettyimages_1726766634.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1726766634"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-1726766634. Cole Burston - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>“To me, strength makes me think of a healthy runner. Getting a good strength routine—whatever that means to the individual—means being healthy and consistent in running.”</em></p><p><strong>Strength Routine</strong>: I’ve done heavier lifting in the past—I was coached by J.J. Clark at UConn, and we were in the weight room three days a week, doing Olympic lifts like a true 800-meter runner. That was super beneficial to my young career. My current coach, Terrence Mahon, is big into strength training. But for me, at this point, we’ve found that what’s most important is injury-preventing, smaller-muscle training with bodyweight and resistance bands. I do it five days a week for 10 to 30 minutes, often activation-style before my run.</p><p><strong>Benefits for Running</strong>: Female distance runners—our quads are strong, our glutes are strong, everything’s so strong, but a lot of us have a weak core or center. When my running form starts to break down, especially over the marathon, the first place that I break down is the center of my body. Strengthening that is so important.</p><p>I wouldn’t say they’re my favorite to do, but the bird dog or the dead bug are the most important. They look so simple, but if you’re breathing correctly and in the right position, it’s way harder than anything I’ve done in the gym my entire life.</p><p><strong>Bird Dog: </strong></p><ol><li>Start on all fours with a neutral spine, knees under hips and wrists under shoulders. This is the starting position. </li><li>Extend right arm and left leg straight out and in line with torso, keeping hips and shoulders square to floor. </li><li>Bring right elbow and left knee in toward chest so they touch. </li><li>Return to starting position. </li><li>Repeat on the opposite side. </li><li>Continue alternating</li></ol><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
