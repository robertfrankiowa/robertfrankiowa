    <main><h1>10 Best Protein Bars for Weight Loss</h1><p>If you have a goal to slim down or improve your fitness, eating healthy snacks between meals is just as important as what you choose for your main meals. That's because, for most of us, snacks contribute to about a third of our daily calories. One of the best ways to choose healthy, nutrient-dense snacks that help keep you satisfied is to look for a wholesome protein bar.</p><p>Research shows that eating a diet that optimizes protein at about 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight (.5 to .7 grams per pound body weight) or about 20-30 grams of healthy protein sources per meal, can lead to better weight management and lower body fat while reducing risk for some chronic health conditions. Having the right high-protein bars on hand can help you when you need a between-meal snack that will keep you on track.</p><p>Here are the 10 best protein bars for weight loss, according to nutrition pros. Read on, and for more, don't miss 10 Amazing Benefits of Eating Protein.</p><figure><img title="10 Best Protein Bars for Weight Loss" src="IMG/AA1h14YL_10_best_protein_bars_for_weight_loss.jpg" alt="10 Best Protein Bars for Weight Loss"><figcaption><em>10 Best Protein Bars for Weight Loss. © Provided by Eat This, Not That!</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1.

Quest also has no added sugar, making the bars a great option for those counting their carbs to help with weight management. The dairy-based protein is high-quality and helps provide essential amino acids your body needs. They are sweetened with erythritol, stevia zero-calorie sweetener, and sucralose.</p><h2>3. Power Crunch Pro Peanut Butter Fudge</h2><p><p>Power Crunch protein bars are a favorite of registered dietitian and certified athletic trainer, <strong>Dana Angelo White, MS, Rd, ATC.</strong> "These bars are, come in great flavors, and offer up a good dose of protein. The protein source in these bars is primary whey protein, so the protein will be digested and absorbed slowly to help keep you satisfied longer," notes Angelo White. The bars are also sweetened with stevia so added sugars are lower than many other bars.</p><h2>4. Clif Builders Bar Chocolate Mint</h2><p><p>Clif Builders Bars exceed our guidelines for added sugar, but Angelo White says they are still a good option for active individuals to enjoy post-exercise. The protein is soy protein isolate, and soy protein concentrate so the bar provides all essential amino acids to optimize recovery. With 3 grams of fiber and 20 grams of protein, the Builders Bars will help you keep your calories in check.</p><h2>5. Aloha Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip</h2><p><p>Packed with 14 grams of plant-based protein, 10 grams of fiber for gut health, and only 3 grams of added sugar, Aloha Protein Bars are a great choice, says <strong>Patricia Bannan, MS, RDN</strong>, author of <em>From Burnout to Balance.</em> They are also vegan, gluten-free, and USDA-certified organic.</p><h2>6. KIND Protein Crunchy Peanut Butter</h2><p><p>This 250-calorie bar packs in 12 grams of protein and 6 grams of filling fiber. The protein in this bar comes from peanuts, soy protein isolate, and nonfat milk powder. Added sugar is limited to 5 grams so this bar packs a lot of positive nutrition in a calorie-controlled bar.</p><figure><img title="6.

What's more, the protein comes from organic brown rice protein, pea protein, and chia seeds. Added sugars are kept low because the bars are sweetened with erythritol, as well as other sweeteners.</p><h2>10. Dang Lemon Matcha</h2><p><p>This bar is shy of our 10-gram protein guideline by just 1 gram. However, we like that the bar is made with almonds, pea protein, and chia seeds and packs in a whopping 6 grams of fiber. The fiber and protein combo with help keep you satisfied, so you're less likely to overeat.</p></main>
