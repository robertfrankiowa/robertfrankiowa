There are several different ways to do this, but this is my preferred method: use your knife to trim away the sides of the pineapple to remove the eyes, making sure that you leave as much flesh as possible.</p><h2>Different Pineapple Cuts</h2><p><strong>To cut pineapple wedges or cubes</strong>, stand the pineapple upright and cut the fruit away from the center core in planks. Discard the core. The core is woody and fibrous, so not pleasant to eat. Cut the planks into wedges or cubes. The pineapple is ready to use.</p><p><strong>To cut pineapple rings: </strong>Cut the pineapple into slices about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 1-inch or so round cutter, cut and remove the cores from the slices to make rings. The pineapple is ready to use.</p><h2>How to choose a ripe pineapple</h2><ul><li>Fresh pineapples don't ripen off the plant, so those that you buy are ready to eat. Choose pineapples that are large and plump, and avoid those that have any signs of shriveled skin or browned leaves at the crown.</li><li>A ripe pineapple typically has a golden or yellowish-brown skin. Green is a red flag that it was picked too early. </li><li>Smell the bottom end of the fruit. If it smells sweet and tropical, that’s a green light. If it smells sour or has no smell at all, keep searching. </li><li>Unlike other fruits, pineapple doesn’t continue to ripen after it’s picked. It doesn’t have starch reserves that, in something like a peach, convert to sugars on your counter. Instead, it gets more sour and eventually begins to rot over time. </li></ul><h2>How to store fresh pineapple</h2><ul><li>Store fresh cut pineapple in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Cut pineapple will release its natural juice, which will help prevent it browning and retain flavor.</li><li>You can also freeze cut pineapple in a plastic zipper-top freezer bag for up to 6 months.</li></ul><h2>What is bromelain?</h2><p>Fresh pineapples, as well as kiwi fruit and papaya, contain an enzyme called bromelain, that breaks down protein. For this reason, these fruits work well in marinades, but they will also cause dairy products to break down and separate. How</p><h2>How to hollow out a pineapple for serving</h2><p>A hallowed out pineapple shell makes a good receptacls for serving items like fruit salad. salsas. or just cut-up pineapple.</p><p>Start by cutting the pineapple in half lengthwise, cutting through the leaves as well as for a dramatic effect. Whit a sharp knife, cut along one side of the core and then around the inside of the shell to loosen a large section of the fruit. Leave about 1-inch of shell. Repeat on the other side of the core. Remove the fruit, then cut out the core by running your knife under it from one end to the other. Discard the core and fill the shell as you'd like.</p><h2>How to make pineapple boats</h2><p>Cut the pineapple lengthwise into quarters, including the leaves, then cut out the core from each one. Without removing the flesh entirely, slide a knife between the flesh and skin on each wedge to separate them. Cut the flesh crosswise into slices and push alternate slices of the pineapple to the left and right.</p><h2>How to Cut Fresh Pineapple</h2><p>To ensure that you're getting perfectly juicy pineapple, buy it whole and cut it yourself.
