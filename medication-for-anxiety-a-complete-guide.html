Are you already in the process of getting a prescription for one? Great. Here's the information you’ll want to know before swallowing that first capsule or tablet.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Below, is a list of medications currently used to treat anxiety, along with information on each medication’s therapeutic effects, side effects and more. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Here you'll find the basic stats on everything on the market for the treatment of anxiety. Before that, however, there are some top-line facts you should know about these medications.</p><h2>Anxiety Medications: An Overview</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Anxiety disorders are very common, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. An estimated 31.1 percent of all American adults will experience some form of anxiety disorder during their lives, and many of those people could benefit from one of the many tested, proven medications for anxiety on the market right now.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">These medications go by a few names — they’re sometimes called anxiolytics, or anti-anxiety drugs. Anxiety medications may even fall under other medication categories, like antidepressants. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Types of anxiety pills include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Antidepressants</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Benzodiazepines</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Beta-blockers</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Other medications, like buspirone</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">As a whole, anxiety meds are some of the most widely used medications in the United States — in 2019, nearly 16 percent of American adults were prescribed some type of psychiatric medication. These medications all work in slightly different ways to reduce the severity of anxiety symptoms and help you enjoy an easier, less stressful daily life.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Medications don’t “cure” anxiety like some instant health pill from the future. In order for them to keep working, you have to continue taking them, but they can reduce or even eliminate the symptoms of anxiety that prevent you from asking that person out, quitting your job for a new career path or simply leaving your house to run errands.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">To understand how each class of medication helps to reduce your symptoms of anxiety, read on.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Antidepressants for Anxiety</h2><p>Believe it or not, one of the most common ways of medicating anxiety is by using a medication for another type of mental health condition — depression. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Certain antidepressants are prescribed to treat anxiety because they target the neurotransmitters responsible for the feelings and symptoms that characterize anxiety disorders. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Most antidepressants can often take several weeks to begin treating anxiety symptoms, which means they’re not the quickest option out there and aren’t usually used for relief of acute panic attacks or other short-term anxiety symptoms. But because of their overall safety track record, antidepressants are generally used for long-term treatment and management of chronic anxiety. </p><h3 class="sc-193c53f9-2 gNyDQM">Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</h3><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, are one of the most popular types of antidepressants today, and they’re often used to treat anxiety disorders. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Serotonin is a neurotransmitter responsible for regulating important things like your mood, ability to concentrate, memory, ability to relax, appetite and ability to sleep. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">People affected by anxiety and depression are believed (at least in part) to have altered levels of serotonin. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">SSRIs, which first came onto the market in the 1980s, work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin into your brain. This increases the levels of serotonin on hand and can lessen anxiety symptoms.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">While they’re not considered addictive and are not abused (unlike benzodiazepines), SSRIs have a variety of potential side effects that you should be aware of before using any medication of this type for an anxiety disorder.</p><h3 class="sc-193c53f9-2 gNyDQM">List of SSRIs Used to Treat Anxiety</h3><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In the United States, several SSRIs are prescribed to treat anxiety disorders. Common SSRIs used to treat anxiety include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Sertraline</b>. Sold under the brand name Zoloft, sertraline is a widely used SSRI that’s primarily prescribed to treat depression. It’s also used to treat anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder and panic disorder.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Escitalopram</b>. Also sold under the brand name Lexapro, escitalopram is prescribed to treat several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorders.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Paroxetine</b>. Also known as the brand name drug Paxil (and others), paroxetine is prescribed to treat social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and several other anxiety-related medical conditions.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Fluoxetine</b>. Sold under the brand name Prozac, fluoxetine is approved for treating certain forms of anxiety, namely OCD and panic disorder. Healthcare professionals might also prescribe fluoxetine off-label for generalized anxiety disorder.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Fluvoxamine</b>. Sold under the brand name Luvox, fluvoxamine is prescribed for social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Citalopram</b>. As a generic and under the brand name Celexa, citalopram is prescribed off-label to treat anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Citalopram is also used as an off-label treatment for certain eating disorders, including binge eating disorder.</p></li></ul><h3 class="sc-193c53f9-2 gNyDQM">Other Common Antidepressants for Anxiety </h3><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In addition to SSRIs, several other types of antidepressants are commonly prescribed to treat depression. These include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) </p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">These are just some of the many antidepressants on the market today.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">And now, onto the details about these three big alternates.</p><h4 class="sc-193c53f9-3 evmtrB">Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</h4><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">As the name suggests, SNRIs work similarly to SSRIs, with one key change (yes, the one letter). In addition to increasing the amount of serotonin in your brain, they also increase the level of norepinephrine — a neurotransmitter responsible for regulating alertness, attention, memory and other mental and physical functions.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">SNRIs used to treat anxiety include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Duloxetine</b>. Sold under the brand name Cymbalta, duloxetine is an SNRI that’s used to treat generalized anxiety disorder.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Venlafaxine</b>. Sold under the brand name Effexor, venlafaxine is used to treat social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.</p></li></ul><h4 class="sc-193c53f9-3 evmtrB">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h4><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are older antidepressants that were first discovered in the 1950s by clinical researchers. While they don’t have a starring role in the anxiety treatment series now streaming in your local pharmacy, some MAOIs may be effective as treatment for anxiety conditions such as social anxiety disorder and panic disorder. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Like other antidepressants, MAOIs work by boosting your brain’s level of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. While effective, they’re more likely to cause side effects and drug interactions than newer antidepressants used to treat anxiety.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Most MAOIs are not approved by the FDA to treat anxiety. However, they may be prescribed by your healthcare provider for off-label use if other treatments aren’t effective. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">MAOI antidepressants that may be used to treat anxiety disorders include phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re prescribed a MAOI, your healthcare provider may require you to carefully monitor your use of other medications and consumption of certain foods to avoid interactions.</p><h4 class="sc-193c53f9-3 evmtrB">Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</h4><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Last but certainly not least, some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are used to treat anxiety disorders. Tricyclics are also an older class of antidepressants first developed in the 1950s. They work by increasing the levels of certain mood-related neurotransmitters in your brain, and are used to treat anxiety disorders. TCAs for anxiety include: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Clomipramine</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Doxepin</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Imipramine</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Older antidepressant medications like tricyclic antidepressants typically have a higher risk of side effects than the more modern SSRI and SNRI medications. Because of this, they’re rarely used as first-line treatments for anxiety. So if you’re prescribed one of these, it’s likely because the SSRIs and SNRIs didn’t work for you.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Benzodiazepines</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Benzodiazepines are some of the most widely used medications in the United States, with tens of millions of users nationwide, with data from clinical studies indicating that benzodiazepine use is highest in older people. They’re a class of medications used to treat anxiety disorders, and some are also prescribed as sleeping pills for the short-term treatment and management of insomnia.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Benzodiazepines reduce anxiety, relax muscles and promote sedation. They’re almost exclusively prescribed for short-term use because over the long term, benzodiazepine use can lead to dependence and abuse. If they’re used for longer periods of time, they can be almost impossible to stop because of severe withdrawal symptoms. Some doctors feel that the long-term risks are so great that it’s best not to use them at all.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The good news is that, for the short term, they can be literal life savers. Benzodiazepines typically start working very quickly — their anti-anxiety effects may come on in less than an hour. They work so well (short-term) that many people don’t want to stop taking them. That’s one reason why they can be so dangerous.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Benzodiazepines work by increasing the effects of a neurotransmitter called gamma-amino butyric acid, or GABA. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter — its job is to decrease activity in the neurons to which it binds. This can cause you to feel less anxious, stressed and fearful.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">GABA is also thought to regulate emotion, memory, thinking and certain essential biological functions. By increasing the effects of GABA, benzodiazepines essentially slow down certain activity in the brain to reduce feelings of anxiety and stress. </p><h3 class="sc-193c53f9-2 gNyDQM">List of Benzodiazepines for Anxiety</h3><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Common benzodiazepines for anxiety include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Alprazolam</b>. Sold as Xanax, alprazolam is the most widely prescribed benzodiazepine in the United States. It’s used to treat a large range of anxiety and panic disorders.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Chlordiazepoxide</b>. As brand name Librium and a generic, chlordiazepoxide is typically used to treat anxiety and certain symptoms of alcohol/drug withdrawal.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Clonazepam</b>. Better known as Klonopin, this medication is sometimes prescribed for anxiety disorders like panic disorder, as well as for seizures.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Clorazepate</b>. Sold under the brand names Tranxene and Gen-Xene, clorazepate is prescribed to treat a range of anxiety disorders.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Diazepam</b>. Also known as Valium, diazepam is another widely prescribed benzodiazepine that’s used to treat anxiety disorders, panic attacks, seizures (typically in combination with other drugs) and drug and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Estazolam</b>. Sold under the brand name Prosom, estazolam is typically prescribed as a treatment for insomnia, including insomnia caused by anxiety.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Flurazepam</b>. Available as Dalmane, Flurazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative that’s primarily used as a short-term treatment for insomnia.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Lorazepam</b>. Sold under the brand name Ativan, lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety in some cases.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Oxazepam</b>. As a generic and the brand names drugs Serax and Zaxopam, oxazepam is used to treat anxiety and certain symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam and triazolam (available as Halcion), are used as sleep aids and aren’t widely prescribed for anxiety. </p><h3 class="sc-193c53f9-2 gNyDQM">Benzodiazepine Side Effects</h3><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Benzodiazepines can cause side effects, including some that may affect your alertness, physical health and daily life.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Common side effects of benzodiazepines include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Drowsiness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Confusion</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Headache</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Upset stomach</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Vomiting</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Diarrhea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tremors</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In some cases, benzodiazepines may cause breathing issues, including respiratory depression (failure of the lungs to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen properly).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">When taken in the evening, particularly when used to treat anxiety-related insomnia, it’s common for some benzodiazepines to cause a next-morning “hangover” effect. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Most benzodiazepines are only recommended for short-term use. When used for the long term, treatment with benzodiazepines can lead to dependence, addiction and abuse.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Due to the potential of dependence and abuse, it’s important to follow your healthcare provider’s instructions closely if you’re prescribed benzodiazepine medications. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">These anti-anxiety medications can also cause withdrawal symptoms if they’re stopped suddenly, especially if you’ve been taking one at a high dose for a while.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re prescribed any type of benzodiazepine, do not abruptly stop taking it without first talking to your healthcare provider. They’ll tell you how to safely reduce your dosage and stop using your medication without developing withdrawal syndrome.</p><h2 class="sc-193c53f9-1 laitcL">Beta Blockers for Anxiety</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Beta blockers are a class of medications that are used to reduce blood pressure. They’re often prescribed to manage heart conditions, such as angina, irregular heartbeat and heart failure, or to increase heart function in people who’ve recently had a heart attack.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Certain beta blocker medications are also effective at treating the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as tremors.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Although they aren’t approved by the FDA as medications for anxiety, your healthcare provider may prescribe a beta blocker off-label if you’re affected by anxiety in stressful situations. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Beta blockers work by blocking the effects of epinephrine, or adrenaline, a hormone responsible for controlling your fight-or-flight response. By blocking the effects of epinephrine, beta blockers slow your heartbeat and improve blood flow throughout your body.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Beta blockers may be particularly helpful for treating the symptoms of performance anxiety — a form of anxiety that’s related to speaking, acting or performing in front of others in certain social situations. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Like benzodiazepines, beta blockers start working quite quickly to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety. For example, propranolol, a widely used beta blocker, usually starts working less than one hour after it’s taken.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">One thing to note about beta blockers is that they only treat the physical effects of anxiety, not the underlying psychological cause. However, if you’re standing in front of an audience, and the medication is keeping your heart rate steady while also preventing you from trembling and sweating, you’ll probably feel more confident.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">As such, they’re usually just prescribed to treat moderate or severe anxiety that only occurs in certain situations, such as anxiety related to public speaking or other stressful situations. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Beta blockers used to treat anxiety include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Propranolol</b>. Propranolol is a common, widely prescribed beta blocker that’s often used off-label to treat performance anxiety. If you often experience the physical symptoms of anxiety while speaking, interviewing or auditioning, this medication may help.</p><p>Propranolol has been used in the United States for more than 40 years.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Atenolol</b>. Atenolol is a slightly longer-acting beta blocker than propranolol.

However, several other types of medication are also used to treat anxiety. Seroquel, an antipsychotic, is used off-label. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Other medications for anxiety include: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Antihistamines</b>. Some antihistamines have a calming effect, making them an effective option for mild to moderate anxiety. They can also help to promote sleep — a common difficulty for people with anxiety. Hydroxyzine, sold under the brand name Vistaril, is occasionally used as a short-term treatment for anxiety.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Anticonvulsants</b>. Anticonvulsant medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, may help to treat symptoms of certain anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. In many states, gabapentin and pregabalin are controlled substances because they can be habit-forming. It’s best to try other options first.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Buspirone</b>. Buspirone is an azapirone medication that’s used to treat certain anxiety disorders, though it does have some limitations.
