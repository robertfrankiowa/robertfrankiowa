    <main><h1>This Comedian Lost 200 Pounds. The Next Step Was Figuring Out Who He Was.</h1><p><p class="body-dropcap"><strong>WHEN YOU'RE A</strong> big fat stand-up comedian, you quickly figure out that audiences want to hear you talk about how you’re a big fat stand-up comedian. They’ll laugh about other stuff, but they want the fat jokes. They’re at the circus; they want to see the elephants. I like dignity, but not half as much as I like attention, so I happily obliged. I built a ca­reer on fat jokes. I like to think they were clever fat jokes. I wanted my shtick like my triglyceride count, elevated. </p><p>They were fat jokes all the same, though. I rode that s*** with the same regularity that I didn’t ride a bike. I talked about the best way to prepare kale (throw it in the garbage; order a pizza). </p><p>Then I lost weight. I dropped from 420 pounds down to around 230. Wonderful for my health, an absolute disaster for my com­edy. The act was obsolete, sure, but that wasn’t my biggest prob­lem. I could write jokes, but I didn’t know who I was anymore. I didn’t know who the audience saw when I walked onstage. For a while I got by on joking about how I had nothing to joke about because I’d lost so much weight. The audiences full of kindhearted people didn’t laugh at all, and the audiences full of pricks laughed a little too loud. </p><p>After one set, an audience member, a fat woman, found me and she told me I probably shouldn’t tell those jokes anymore. I agreed. I’d already felt that instinct deep in my heart, but I was flustered and confused and, for the very first time in my career, frightened onstage. It used to be the place where I felt the most comfortable.</p><p>I’m still figuring out who I am onstage. That’s because I’m still figuring out who I am offstage. So much of my identity was tied up in being a very fat person. I was so wrapped up in beating people to the punch in their perception of me that I lost quite a bit of who I actually was in that pursuit. </p><p>When I look in the mirror, I see the same person I’ve always seen. I don’t see skinny me. When I was fatter, I didn’t see fat me. I just saw me. Part of that is my unparalleled ability to find a flat­tering angle in literally any mirror. Seriously, any mirror. I’ll find my light in a piece of dental equipment. Part of seeing the same man in the mirror, 200 pounds apart, is the simple reality that, for the most part, I’m the same person. </p><p>I take a lot of comfort in seeing the same me in the mirror. Losing weight feels great in a lot of ways, but the schism in my identity is unmooring. I feel that most when I look at an old pic­ture of me, one where I’m much heavier. I don’t get a sense of “goddamn, look at me now.”</p><p>It’s more a sense of “goddamn, look at me then.” It’s a much different goddamn. It feels like looking at a different person. The dissonance between the consistency of the image in the mirror and the concussive blow of seeing an old picture can be explained by all the things I just described, the gradual versus the sudden, but I don’t think it can all be tied to that. I think a lot of that feeling can be explained by what parts of myself I allowed myself to acknowledge and what parts of myself I ignored so I could ad­equately get through the daily rigors of life. I see a person who is physically much bigger than I am right now. That’s the most strik­ing, but I think the difference that resonates with me the most when I see those old pictures is that I see a person who still had so much to work through mentally, emotionally, and for lack of a less trite term, spiritually.</p><p>I could not let myself process the catastrophic burden on my health that was created and sustained by being very fat. I spent years trying to pretend there wasn’t a wolf scratching at the door. </p><p>There’s a part of me that is trying to retcon the appropriate amount of considered trauma for the past few decades by overloading on it now. Did you ever fall so far behind in math class that you’ve got to write an essay about Archi­medes and watch a documentary about Rubik’s Cubes just to get a passing grade? I’m doing that, but with freaking out about my s*** instead of algebra. It doesn’t work, by the way. You can’t throw off the average, and you can’t game your own trauma. In the words of that same algebra teacher, you can try to make up the work, but you’re only cheating yourself.</p><p>So I stopped pretending nothing was wrong. Sometimes we develop unhealthy habits to help us cope. Our broken bones don’t heal wrong out of spite, but they can still trip you up all the same. </p><figure><img title="Courtesy Karmel" src="IMG/BB1o1jZj_screenshot_2024_05_13_at_52357_pmjpg.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 5.23.57 PM.jpg"><figcaption><em>Karmel’s weight loss process taught him lots, including that if you want to feel better, it helps to treat yourself better..

That sentence is so Los Ange­les that my computer started playing the Entourage theme halfway through typing it. It’s true, though. He sat me down, and in his relaxed, reassuring, and perfectly tanned voice told me that I should start meditating for my health: simple, ten-minute guided meditations. It could lower my blood pressure, it might help my anxiety, and there was even a chance it’d put a stop to my panic attacks. </p><p>It did all three of those things. The lower blood pressure and the fewer panic attacks speak for themselves, but meditation’s ability to help me to chop through the suffocating vines of anxiety is the feature I most often appreciate. My anxiety has a profound impact on my life. My anxiety fuels my most self-destructive habits: my overeating, binge drinking, drug use, and thoughtless sex. All of them pop a road flare and wave at the monster; none of them do anything more useful than distract.</p><p>Once I started peeling away my methods of self-medication, it became extremely clear extremely fast that I am an extremely anxious per­son. Meditation helps with my anxiety. It helps in a preventative way, and it helps when I feel my chest tightening and the panic bubbling up through my bones.</p><figure><img title="amazon.com" src="IMG/BB1o13UO_t_shirt_swim_club_stories_from_being_fat_in_a_world_of_thin_people.jpg" alt="T-Shirt Swim Club: Stories from Being Fat in a World of Thin People"><figcaption><em>T-Shirt Swim Club: Stories from Being Fat in a World of Thin People. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>Your mileage may vary, of course, such is life, but I recommend meditation to nearly everyone I meet. I use an app, one of the big brands. It guides me through a daily ten-minute meditation. It’s radically kind to take ten minutes to yourself. Make it the ten minutes you would have spent scrolling through Instagram or cycling through s*** on Net­flix before you land back on the same sitcom you’ve already watched through to completion ten different times. </p><p>It’s okay if you don’t meditate every day. I don’t. I go months without it sometimes. I always feel better when I do make that time, though. It feels like gently dipping my brain in a pool. Sometimes medita­tion can lead you to important realizations. Sometimes it’s just sitting there quietly for ten minutes while you think about how it’s weird that both Ronald and Donald are names. Either way, it’s time well spent.</p><p>At the heart of what I’m after right now is the notion of self-respect and love. Like, real self-respect and love. Figure out what’s messing you up and do the best you can to put a stop to it. What’s that old joke? A man walks into a doctor’s office, his arm bent at the elbow, and he says, “Doctor, it hurts when I do this, what should I do?” The doctor replies, “Stop doing that.” Look, it’s not the perfect joke for this situation, but I told you, I had to throw out my entire act. I’m a work in progress. </p><h2 class="body-h2">What Works for Me</h2><p><strong>BRAINS AND BODIES</strong> are unique, and what keeps me on course might send you spinning into oblivion (Taco Bell). But this is what worked for me to lose and keep off weight: </p><h3 class="body-h3">I Weigh Myself</h3><p>I weigh myself the way I use rose­mary. It would be insane to sit at a table and eat sprig after sprig of rosemary like a goat or a performance art installation or some­thing, but if you toss a little bit of that stuff on some chicken, it can really sing. The scale isn’t the main ingredient, but it helps the other ones make more sense. My weight creeping up correlates to how stressed I am in life. Seeing that expressed as a number on a scale is like splashing cold water on your face—it sucks, but it can wake you up.</p><h3 class="body-h3">I Started Treating Myself Better</h3><h3 class="body-h3">I Developed Boring Habits</h3><p>Maintaining a healthy weight is a total yawn fest and that mundan­ity is a gift and a curse. Preparing your meals in advance is about as dull as it gets. I mean, Tupperware is involved. Meal prepping may feel like it’s overly strict, limiting your choices to what you cooked up on Sunday night while you blasted through HBO’s offerings. The truth is, you’re actually giving yourself more options. The drive-through is always going to be there. Postmates isn’t declining your order because you’ve got some salmon in the fridge. But if you find yourself stressed out of your gourd on a Wednesday, let’s be honest, you probably aren’t going to swing through the grocery store to buy yourself a bunch of ingredients you’re then going to have to take home and cook. Give yourself the healthy option and you’ll be surprised by how often you find yourself going for it. Pop open that Tupperware, baby, it’s time to get boring.</p><h2 class="body-h2">A Taxonomy of Weight</h2><p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
