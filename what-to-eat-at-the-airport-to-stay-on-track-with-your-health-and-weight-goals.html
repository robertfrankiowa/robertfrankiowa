    <main><h1>What to Eat at the Airport to Stay on Track With Your Health and Weight Goals</h1><p>Some say the minute you arrive at the airport, all rules of society fly out of the window. Want to drink a beer at 9 a.m.? You can find one at the next bar over. A bag of chips for lunch? Many of us have done it. Feel like taking a nap on the floor? No one will stop you.</p><p>While this break from routine might seem fun, the way it makes your body feel might not be. The fast food, processed snacks, and high-sodium options often found in airport convenience stores can lead to bloating, digestive disturbances, and fatigue — none of which are ideal for a vacation. What’s more, if you’re trying to lose or maintain weight, making choices that keep you on track may be tougher at the airport.</p><p>To help you overcome those hurdles, Jennifer Hernandez, RDN, founder of Plant-Powered Kidneys in Hollywood, Florida, and Maggie Bell, RD, owner of Maggie Bell Nutrition & Wellness in Little Rock, Arkansas, provide dietitian-approved airport snacks and meal options below, plus additional tips for making the most of your airport dining experience.</p><h2>Healthy Snack Options at the Airport Convenience Store</h2><p>Most convenience stores or fresh grab-and-go stations at the airport include dietitian-approved snacks like these.</p><h3>Pre-Chopped Vegetables</h3><p>Both Bell and Hernandez recommend looking for pre-chopped vegetables like carrot sticks, celery sticks, radish slices, or cherry tomatoes in a ready-to-eat package. Then, pair your veggies with an individually portioned container of hummus for extra flavor, fiber, and protein.</p><p>Not only does hummus provide a creamy balance to the crunch of sliced veggies, but it also makes an excellent source of plant-based protein and fiber, according to a research review. Additionally, “having some protein in your snack [helps] keep your blood sugar balanced,” says Hernandez, echoing the review’s findings that indicate its short-term effectiveness for glucose control.</p><h3>Veggie-and-Hummus Sandwich or Wrap</h3><p>If you want something more substantial, eat hummus and veggies in the form of a sandwich or wrap. This combines vegetables, protein, and carbs in a convenient fork-free method that you can also take on the plane.</p><p>“This is a great way to keep up your nutrients,” Hernandez notes. Indeed, hummus contains fiber — 1.83 grams (g) in 2 tablespoons, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It also comes in many flavors that can make on-the-go snacking more palatable. And it’s good for you: A review found that people who regularly eat chickpeas and hummus not only have higher levels of dietary fiber, but also polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, magnesium, potassium, and iron.</p><h3>Fresh Fruit Cups</h3><p>Many of the busiest airports in the U.S. offer fresh produce. According to Produce Business, over 71 percent of U.S. airports offer at least one high-fiber, plant-based meal option. If you can’t find prepared fresh fruit cups at grab-and-go stations, try asking for a side of fruit at a sit-down restaurant.</p><p>Fruit contains fiber, and one study highlights that the fiber in fruit helps lower the risk of many different health conditions while reducing body weight and waist circumference.</p><h3>Dried Fruit</h3><p>If you can’t find fresh fruit while traveling, look for low-sugar dried fruit. While dried fruit may not provide the full benefits of the real deal, it will still have nutritional value.</p><p>“Fruit is a great source of vitamin C that can help you with your immune system while flying,” says Hernandez, supported by a study.</p><h3>Trail Mix of Nuts and Dried Fruit</h3><p>Speaking of dried fruit, most trail mixes include a mixture of carbs, fats, and protein, making them a potentially healthy snack.</p><p>“Trail mix is a great way to pair a carbohydrate and a protein to keep blood sugars balanced and have food that keeps you satisfied,” Hernandez says.</p><p>To find the most nutritious option, look for a trail mix that includes heart-healthy nuts such as almonds, per research — but avoid the ones that contain a lot of chocolate or other candies.</p><h2>Healthy Foods to Order at the Airport Restaurant</h2><p>If you have time to sit down at a restaurant or buy a meal, choose something to help keep you full and energized while traveling. “At airport restaurants, I opt for a baked, broiled, or grilled protein paired with non-starchy and starchy vegetables,” says Bell.</p><p>Here are some other healthy meals you could order at an airport.</p><h3>Sandwiches</h3><p>“These are packed full of great protein, vegetables, and carbs,” says Hernandez. And if you’re watching your carbs, fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s offer a lettuce-and-protein-only option to help you control your carb levels.</p><h3>Salads</h3><p>To make a salad even more nutritious, says Hernandez, choose protein-rich toppings and be mindful of your dressing. “Salad dressings may be packed with salt and/or sugar, so oil and vinegar could be an easy, healthy dressing,” she says. Hernandez also recommends asking for dressing on the side, so you can control how much of it you use.</p><h3>Soups</h3><p>Hernandez says soups often offer protein and vegetables that can help keep you full. “Look for one that includes veggies and whole grains, like rice or barley, to give you energy and keep you full longer,” she suggests. “And be sure to drink plenty of water, as soup can pack a lot of salt.”</p><h3>Low-Sugar Drinks</h3><p>Hernandez recommends sticking to low-sugar beverage options, like bottled or sparkling water, zero-sugar sodas, or unsweetened hot or iced tea. If you don’t enjoy plain water, Bell suggests ordering water and then adding your own flavor enhancer for variety.</p><h2>Additional Tips for Healthy Eating at the Airport</h2><h3>Pair Low-Quality Snacks With Something Nutritious</h3><p>“Too much salt or sugar may leave you feeling bloated or tired,” says Hernandez. In fact, one study found that foods that are processed, high in sugar and sodium, and low in dietary fiber can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, gas, and upset stomach.</p><p>So to make sure you don’t go overboard on salt or sugar, Hernandez recommends pairing each of those choices with something nutritious. For example, if you eat a bag of salty chips, she suggests drinking extra water or a low-sugar beverage with it to stay hydrated. Or, if you eat sweets, add a pack of unsalted nuts for additional protein and fiber. At the same time, Hernandez says you don’t have to avoid all lower-nutrition foods, as long as you eat them in moderation.</p><h3>Balance Your Macronutrients</h3><p>Well-balanced snacks can help you feel your best physically while you’re traveling. “When choosing airport snacks, prioritize options that offer a balance of protein, fat, and carbohydrates,” suggests Bell. “This trio of macronutrients is essential for stabilizing blood sugar levels and sustaining energy throughout the day. Avoid consuming carbohydrates in isolation, as they can lead to rapid blood sugar spikes.” Indeed, a study demonstrated that eating carbs alone results in significantly higher blood sugar levels than eating carbs paired with a protein source.</p><p>“My go-to snacks for plane travel include a homemade trail mix, turkey sandwich, protein shake, and The Only Bar by Truvani,” adds Bell. “These selections provide a nutritious balance of macronutrients to support energy levels during travel.”</p><p>To help you eat healthy as you travel, Hernandez suggests packing the following items for your flight.</p><ul>  <li><strong>Hydration packs:</strong> “It’s important to stay hydrated on planes,” Hernandez says, which the Cleveland Clinic supports. However, Hernandez recommends watching the sodium in hydration electrolyte packs, because she warns that some options can have 25 percent or more of our daily sodium needs. (The maximum recommendation for daily sodium intake is 2,300 milligrams per day for anyone older than 13, according to the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans.)</li> </ul><ul>  <li><strong>Refillable water bottle:</strong> Having a water bottle to fill during layovers can make it easier to stay hydrated, Hernandez says.</li> </ul><ul>  <li><strong>Probiotics:</strong> “Traveler’s constipation is a thing!” warns Hernandez. She says that packing probiotics can help you stay regular while you travel. (“Don’t forget to get plenty of water and fiber to also help with this,” she adds.)</li> </ul><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Indulging in a few sugary or salty snacks occasionally while traveling won’t hurt, but choosing healthy snacks can help you stick to your health goals. Reach for foods that are low in sodium and high in fiber and provide both carbs and protein to keep your blood sugar balanced. When in doubt, eat snacks like cheese sticks, trail mix, fresh fruit and veggies, or protein bars or shakes — and don’t forget to drink plenty of water. </p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
