Now, a new study of health records and brain imaging studies show that doing something as simple as exercising regularly can help lower the impact of stress in your life.</p><p>The study, which was published in the <em>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</em>, analyzed health data from more than 50,000 adults around age 60. A smaller group of 774 study participants also underwent brain imaging tests and measurements of stress-related brain activity during the 10-year study period.</p><p>During the study, nearly 13 percent of participants developed cardiovascular disease. But those who met the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans' of doing moderate-intensity activity for at least 150 minutes a week had a 23 percent lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with people who didn't meet the recommendations.</p><p>The researchers also discovered that people who did higher levels of physical activity each week were more likely to have lower stress-related brain activity. They also had more function in their prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain involved in decision making and impulse control.</p><p>Exercise even seemed to lower the risk of developing heart disease by decreasing stress-related signals in the brain.</p><p>The positive impact of working out was larger in people who were expected to have higher stress-related brain activity, like those who had depression. "Physical activity was roughly twice as effective in lowering cardiovascular disease risk among those with depression," study co-author Ahmed Tawakol, MD, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement. "Effects on the brain's stress-related activity may explain this novel observation."</p><p>The impact of exercise on stress seemed to plateau after about 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week - but the perks continued beyond that for people with depression.</p><p>Chronic stress has been linked to a higher risk of mental issues, including anxiety and depression, along with physical conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, sleep problems, and weight gain, according to the American Psychological Association (APA).</p><p>If you're dealing with chronic stress, there are a few things you can do.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try to figure out what’s behind your stress</h2><p>In some cases, it’s more obvious than others. The APA recommends monitoring your state of mind throughout the day and writing down the cause of your stress, your thoughts, and your mood when you feel stressed. Once you know what's stressing you out, you can develop a plan to address it, like asking others for help with household duties, job assignments, and other things on your to-to list.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make exercise a part of your life</h2><p>As this study and others have found, being active can help lower your stress levels. The American Heart Association (AHA) notes that doing regular physical activity like brisk walking can improve your quality of life and reduce stress. If you can, try to reach the recommended 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week, along with two days of muscle-strengthening activity. It’s good for your body <em>and</em> mind. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Practice relaxation techniques</h2><p>These can vary for everyone, but things like deep breathing, meditation, yoga, tai chi, and massage can help you to mellow out, both when you're feeling stressed and in general, the Mayo Clinic points out.</p><p>If you're struggling with stress and you don't feel like it's getting better, talk to your doctor. They should be able to help offer personalized tips to get you on the right path.</p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
