    <main><h1>Zinc is important but you should get it from these foods, not pills</h1><p>If you're among the 38 percent of people who lost your sense of taste after a COVID infection, you know what it's like to bite into a crunchy taco or lick your favorite flavor of ice cream and know something's missing. For most of us, savory and flavorful foods are among life's great pleasures − mouthwatering experiences enriched, in part, because of a little mineral called zinc. </p><p>Of course, zinc has much more to offer than improving one's sense of taste, it's a nutrient that "plays a key role in over 100 actions in our body," says Kate Zeratsky, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What is zinc good for?</h2><p><strong><em>Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.</em></strong></p><p>Zinc is an essential mineral found in cells throughout our bodies; but it isn't produced in the body and must be obtained through supplementation or food and drink consumption. It has a host of health benefits, and "is necessary for the activity of over 300 enzymes that aid in metabolism, digestion and nerve function," says Uma Naidoo, MD, director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and the author of “This is Your Brain on Food."</p><p>Zeratsky says such enzymes, along with proteins and genes, are essential for healthy "growth and development," and for the "maintenance of a healthy immune system, skin, hair and nails." </p><p>Zinc also plays a major role in the creation of DNA, cell growth and the healing of damaged tissue. Its lozenge form has often been associated with preventing or improving symptoms of the common cold, but Zeratsky says such research is not robust. Zinc is, however, "an effective treatment for acute diarrhea in children," she says. Research shows it may also slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration − an eye condition that decreases sight in some people. </p><p>As mentioned before, zinc is also involved in the diffusion of taste stimuli in one's taste buds and is sometimes used as a treatment for taste disorders as a result. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms of a zinc deficiency?</h2><p>Beyond affecting one's ability to taste, symptoms of a zinc deficiency include a weakened immune system, hair loss, impotence, eye problems, and "several studies suggest an association between low levels of zinc and the risk of depression," says Naidoo. She adds that zinc deficiencies are associated with ADHD in children as well. </p><p>The good news is, The National Institutes of Health (NIH) says zinc deficiencies are rare in the United States. Even still, because zinc is a trace mineral, Naidoo says it can be hard to detect a deficiency unless it's being looked for specifically. "If you are concerned about being deficient in zinc, your doctor can order the correct test to check this," she offers. </p><p><p class="oembed-link-desc">You've probably heard of curcumin, but you might be confusing it with Turmeric</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Is it good to take zinc every day?</h2><p>Because consuming too much zinc can interfere with copper or iron absorption and may even "become toxic," Naidoo says, it isn't frequently suggested to be taken as a regular supplement. The NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements recommends for adult males to get 11 milligrams of the mineral daily, and for adult women to get 8 milligrams of zinc over the same period of time − more for women who are pregnant or nursing. </p><p>Most people obtain such levels through a balanced diet. Foods rich in the mineral include seafood − especially shellfish − along with beef, poultry, pork, enriched milk and yogurt, rice, eggs, cereals and oats, lentils, and pumpkin seeds. "Food is recommended over supplements," echoes Zeratsky. "That is, unless someone is working with their health care provider to correct a deficiency or has a health condition." </p></main>
