Not only does sleep impact weight — research shows that people who regularly sleep fewer than seven hours per night are more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI, a measure of body fat) — but weight impacts sleep as well. </p><p>In particular, carrying excess body fat can cause sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea and issues like acid reflux and joint pain. These disturbances lower sleep quality, which, when chronic, can lead to (or worsen) other health problems.</p><p>“Sleep is one of the pillars of a healthy lifestyle,” says Indira Gurubhagavatula, MD, MPH, professor of sleep medicine at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “When we don’t get it, we can end up with all sorts of downstream problems, like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.” </p><p>Here, experts explain how being at a higher weight can negatively affect sleep and how weight loss can help.</p><h2>What Is Obstructive Sleep Apnea? </h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common — but in some cases potentially serious — sleep disorder characterized by repeated stops in breathing. It occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat, which relax naturally during sleep, become so relaxed that they collapse partially or completely. When the airway collapses partially, the tissues vibrate, causing snoring. When the airway collapses completely, it becomes closed off. “Oxygen can’t get through, and the oxygen level in the bloodstream drops within seconds,” Dr. Gurubhagavatula says. </p><p>The drop in oxygen sets off a sensor in the brain, which triggers the release of adrenaline. “What adrenaline does is pop us out of sleep and into wakefulness just very briefly. When we’re awake again, the throat opens up, and we can get the oxygen back in,” Gurubhagavatula explains. Once blood oxygen levels return to normal, the adrenaline wears off and we can fall asleep.</p><p>The entire process of waking and returning to sleep only takes a few seconds. Often, people aren’t even aware it happened. The problem is, it can happen dozens of times during the night, Gurubhagavatula says. The frequent wakings interrupt your nightly sleep cycle — the organized pattern your brain follows from the beginning of the night to the end. These disruptions affect sleep quality, leading you to feel tired even if you slept the recommended seven to nine hours. </p><p>Lack of quality sleep from sleep apnea hurts your health. “Long-term sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, heart rhythm abnormalities, heart failure, heart attack, brain problems such as stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, forgetfulness, trouble focusing; it literally hits every system [in your body],” says Gurubhagavatula.</p><h2>The Connection Between Sleep Apnea and Weight</h2><p>Roughly 60 to 90 percent of adults with OSA are overweight, past research shows. However, while being at a higher body weight may increase your chances of developing OSA, it appears that having more abdominal fat is of particular concern, according to research.</p><p>“The muscles of the upper airway relax when we sleep normally, and if somebody has extra fat tissue around their abdomen, this compresses the airway further, causing worsening snoring and sleep apnea,” explains Joseph A. Giaimo, DO, an internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, and sleep medicine physician in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and past president of the American Osteopathic Association.</p><p>If you are at a higher weight and often wake up with a headache or feel unrefreshed after sleeping seven to nine hours, visit a healthcare provider (ideally, a sleep specialist) to get checked for OSA. Another warning sign of OSA is if you wake up gasping for air or someone observes you stop breathing in your sleep. </p><p>“The good thing about [OSA] is it’s very treatable, and treatment improves all the symptoms,” Gurubhagavatula says. Treatment for OSA typically includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a machine that delivers mild air pressure through a tube connected to a mask worn over your nose or your nose and mouth. This air pressure keeps your breathing airways open while you sleep, per the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. If you’re at a higher weight, your doctor may also suggest weight loss to improve your OSA symptoms.</p><h2>How Does Weight Loss Improve Sleep?</h2><p>Weight loss is often recommended for patients with OSA who are overweight.</p><p>Losing weight may not cure OSA, but it may lower OSA severity by reducing the number of times you awaken per night. When less weight compresses the airways, they are less likely to collapse. In fact, research suggests that losing 10 to 15 percent of body weight may reduce OSA severity by 50 percent in people with moderate obesity. </p><p>Fewer sleep interruptions means better sleep quality. Short-term benefits may include fewer morning headaches and feeling more refreshed after a night’s sleep, Dr. Giaimo says. In the long term, improved sleep can lower your risk for serious health problems such as diabetes and heart disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and fewer complications from existing health conditions.</p><p>Weight loss may benefit sleep in other ways. For example, many of Gurubhagavatula’s patients with obesity and OSA continue to have sleep problems even after getting their OSA under control. The reason? “[Obesity] is really hard on the weight-bearing joints,” Gurubhagavatula says. “If you have a lot of extra body fat and your muscles aren’t toned, then your joints end up carrying the weight.” Over time, the joints wear down and become inflamed, which can be painful and interfere with sleep. Weight loss can ease joint inflammation and pain. </p><p>In addition, some people at a higher weight are at a greater risk of acid reflux at night, Gurubhagavatula says. Acid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux (GER), happens when the contents of your stomach come back up into your esophagus, per the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). If GER occurs often and/or causes complications such as inflammation or a narrowing of the esophagus, your doctor may diagnose gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p>“Acid reflux can look and feel just like sleep apnea in that the person may end up choking and tasting something sour in the back of their throat, which causes them to sit up. If it happens often enough, you can feel really tired the next day,” Gurubhagavatula says. Losing weight may reduce nighttime acid reflux, helping you score more uninterrupted sleep.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Carrying excess body weight can impact your sleep in many ways, making weight loss a potentially helpful tool to improve sleep quality. For those with OSA, losing weight can reduce the number of nightly awakenings. In addition, weight loss may ease joint inflammation and pain and reduce nighttime acid reflux.</p><p>Visit a sleep specialist if you are having sleep issues or if you suspect you have OSA. Signs of OSA include snoring, feeling tired even after a full night’s sleep, frequent morning headaches, and waking up gasping for air. Your healthcare provider can work with you to figure out what’s going on and how best to get you the sleep you need for your mood, energy levels, and overall health.</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
