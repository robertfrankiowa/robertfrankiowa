    <main><h1>Does Mushroom Coffee Help You Lose Weight?</h1><p>The buzz about mushroom coffee is real — and it hasn’t gone away. Even Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, invested in a mushroom coffee company and reportedly sent her favorite mushroom latte blend to Oprah.</p><p>This trendy drink usually consists of a unique blend of powdered mushrooms and coffee beans and tastes similar to regular dark roast coffee, with a slightly nuttier, earthier flavor. It contains about half the amount of caffeine of regular coffee, per UCLA Health.</p><p>While you might be happy starting your mornings with 100 percent “real” coffee, claims of mushroom coffee’s potential “weight loss benefits” may have also caught your attention. But are they true? See what dietitians have to say about mushroom coffee and weight loss before you start digging around (figuratively) for your own morning cup of ’shrooms.</p><h2>Caffeine May Increase Metabolism and Weight Loss — but Only for Some</h2><p>Mushroom coffee contains caffeine, which may increase your metabolic rate and contribute to some degree of weight loss, according to research. “Caffeine raises body temperature and burns calories, has appetite-suppressing properties, and increases energy levels leading to increased physical activity,” says Andrea Salazar Castellanos, a registered dietitian with Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.</p><p>However, this applies to unsweetened coffee. When you add sugar to any coffee, it reduces the weight loss effects of caffeine by potentially adding hundreds of calories, Salazar Castellanos notes.</p><p>Case in point: A large study included 48,891 people from the Nurses’ Health Study, 83,464 people from the Nurses’ Health Study II, and 22,863 people from the Health Professional Follow-Up Study. Researchers studied participants’ coffee consumption for four years — both how much coffee they drank and what they added to it. They found that drinking one extra cup of unsweetened coffee per day reduced weight gain by around 0.12 kilograms — about 0.25 pounds — in the four-year period. But when people increased their daily sugar intake by 1 teaspoon in any food or drink (including coffee), they gained 0.09 kilograms, or 0.2 pounds.</p><p>The researchers concluded that coffee intake might help with weight loss, but adding a teaspoon of sugar cancels the effect. So while some mushroom coffee blends on the market do not contain added sugar, you might want to avoid adding it yourself. (Per the same study, adding cream and nondairy creamer didn’t affect weight.)</p><p>Another caveat, says Castellanos: Although coffee might provide an initial metabolism boost, people develop a tolerance to caffeine over time — which the American Heart Association also reports. The body’s natural regulating system, hormones, adjust over time to compensate for the stimulating effect of the brew — which means both the metabolism and calorie-burning level out. </p><h2>Mushroom Coffee May Improve Sleep, an Indirect Factor in Weight Loss</h2><p>Salazar Castellanos notes that because mushroom coffee has less caffeine than regular coffee, it could help reduce anxiety and improve sleep if you usually drink caffeine in higher doses.</p><p>“One has to keep in mind the side effects that may come with increased caffeine consumption, such as jitteriness, palpitations, restlessness, insomnia, and anxiety, which can potentially end up causing weight gain,” says Salazar Castellanos.</p><p>Both anxiety and sleep are relevant factors in losing and maintaining weight, per research. That’s because poor sleep, in terms of both quantity and quality, can increase how much a person eats, mainly from snacking, especially on foods rich in fat and carbohydrates.</p><h2>Mushroom Coffee Does Have Side Effects and Risks</h2><p>The side effects of drinking mushroom coffee mimic the side effects of regular coffee, due to the caffeine — irritability, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset, rapid heart rate, and anxiety, says Beth Czerwony, a registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic’s Digestive Disease and Surgery Institute in Ohio. But because mushroom coffee has about half the caffeine of regular coffee, these side effects will be milder, according to UCLA Health.</p><p>At the same time, little information exists regarding the safe dosage of mushroom coffee in general, its potential medication interactions, and if certain people need to avoid it altogether, says Salazar Castellanos.</p><p>Yet research does point to certain risks. “Chaga, a mushroom commonly found in mushroom coffee blends, is high in oxalates, which can cause kidney stones and further kidney disease,” Salazar Castellanos says. For some people, eating oxalate-rich foods could promote kidney stones and problems, according to the National Kidney Foundation. If you’re at risk for kidney disease or kidney stones, talk with your doctor before making mushroom coffee a regular part of your routine.</p><p>“While [mushroom coffee] is likely safe to drink for the general population, I would urge that people with a history of gastric issues, kidney disease, and those who are pregnant consult their medical provider and dietitian,” Salazar Castellanos adds.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Mushroom coffee offers a unique flavor and potential indirect benefits for weight loss via caffeine, but no significant studies support the idea that it can lead to weight loss directly. Not only that, but any other health benefits would be primarily linked to whole mushrooms, not the powdered forms used in these blends.</p><p>“Take the buzz around mushroom coffee with a grain of salt,” says Salazar Castellanos.</p><p>As with any new dietary trend, be sure to consider the potential side effects and consult with your healthcare provider first if you have a specific health condition.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
