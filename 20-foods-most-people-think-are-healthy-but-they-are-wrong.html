    <main><h1>20 Foods Most People Think Are Healthy, But They Are Wrong</h1><p>Like many parents, I try my best to make nutritious food choices for my family. I pore over nutrition labels, stock up on fruits and veggies, and avoid anything that seems unhealthy or loaded with junk.</p><p>But with so much conflicting nutrition info out there and clever marketing by big food companies, it can be downright confusing to figure out what’s actually good for you.</p><p>In fact, a study published about Demystifying the Food Label revealed that 49% of food products contained some form of nutrition marketing, and alarmingly, 48% of those products were high in saturated fat, sodium, and/or sugar.</p><p>So almost half the time when you see claims like “healthy” or “nutritious” plastered on packaging, it may not be telling the full story.</p><p>Being aware of some of these common healthy food misconceptions can help all of us make smarter choices and achieve our health goals.</p><p>That’s why I’ve put together this definitive guide to 20 surprising foods that get a “health halo” but should actually be limited or avoided altogether on a nutritious diet. Let’s dig in!</p><h2>1. Granola and Granola Bars</h2><p>Granola and granola bars seem like the perfect snack for health-conscious individuals like myself. That crunchy, nutty granola has to be good for you, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, many store-bought varieties are loaded with added sugars like honey, agave, or cane sugar, not to mention unhealthy fats.</p><p>The healthier option is granola bars with minimal added sugars and wholesome ingredients like nuts, seeds, and oats. Even better, try making your own granola at home so you control exactly what goes into it.</p><h2>2. Flavored Yogurt</h2><p>When I want a protein-packed snack, I often reach for yogurt. But those tempting flavored yogurts can be a real sugar bomb!</p><p>Many varieties contain up to 30 grams of sugar per serving, exceeding daily limits according to the American Institute for Cancer Research. Some have even more sugar.</p><p>The healthier choice is plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt providing probiotic goodness without tons of sugar. Sweeten it yourself with fresh fruit.</p><figure><img title="2. Flavored Yogurt" src="IMG/AA1o6rCP_2_flavored_yogurt.jpg" alt="2. Flavored Yogurt"><figcaption><em>2. Flavored Yogurt.

Veggie Chips</h2><p>Don’t be fooled by the name “veggie” chips may be made from real vegetables, but they’re often deep-fried in unhealthy oils, racking up tons of fat and empty calories just like regular potato chips.</p><p>The frying process destroys most of the fiber and nutrients from the original vegetables.</p><p>For a truly healthy crispy snack, try baking your own veggie chips at home using just a light coating of oil. Or munch on fresh, fiber-rich veggies like carrots, bell peppers or cucumber slices.</p><h2>4. Fruit Juice</h2><p>I’ll admit, I love sipping on a cold glass of orange juice in the mornings. It just feels like an easy way to get my daily dose of vitamin C and fruity goodness.</p><p>But here’s the hard truth, even 100% fruit juices lack the fiber found in whole fruits, meaning their natural sugars get released fast into your bloodstream for a quick sugar spike.</p><p>If you’re going to drink juices, water them down or opt for fresh-squeezed varieties without added sugars. But eating whole fruits is always the smarter move.</p><figure><img title="4. Fruit Juice" src="IMG/AA1o6wA8_4_fruit_juice.jpg" alt="4. Fruit Juice"><figcaption><em>4. Fruit Juice.

Those chewy morsels seem like they should be a healthy, portable treat. But the drying process removes much of the water from the original fruit, leaving concentrated sugars that are easy to overeat. </p><p>If you enjoy dried fruits occasionally, practice portion control and pair them with proteins or healthy fats like nuts to help stabilize your blood sugar.</p><figure><img title="5. Dried Fruit" src="IMG/AA1o6pls_5_dried_fruit.jpg" alt="5. Dried Fruit"><figcaption><em>5. Dried Fruit. Provided by ChaChingQueen</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6. Energy Bars</h2><p>With their promises of high protein and “sustainable energy,” energy bars seem like the perfect fuel for active folks like me. But many commercial bars are hiding loads of added sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial ingredients behind their healthy-sounding claims. That sugary energy high will inevitably lead to an energy crash.</p><p>For true and steady energy, look for bars with minimal added sugars and nutrient-dense ingredients like nuts, seeds and whole grains. Homemade is best!</p><h2>7. Protein Powder</h2><p>I love to work out. After my workouts I often make a protein shake. But not all powders are created equal, many have added sugars, artificial sweeteners and other sketchy additives.</p><p>Always read those ingredient labels and opt for clean, minimally-processed protein sources. Or better yet, get your protein from whole foods like eggs, legumes, dairy and ancient grains.</p><p>Personally I like Naked Nutrition. You can read my reviews: A Nice Blend of Protein and Coffee: Naked Nutrition’s Vanilla Protein Coffee Review and Weighing In On Naked Nutrition Whey Protein: A Full Review.</p><h2>8. Gluten-Free Baked Goods</h2><p>Gluten-free baked goods are all the rage these days. We actually share many gluten-free recipes on our site.</p><p>But just because they’re gluten-free doesn’t automatically make them a nutritious indulgence. Many are still loaded with refined flours, added sugars and unhealthy fats, just like their gluten-filled counterparts.</p><p>For a truly virtuous gluten-free treat, look for recipes featuring nutrient-rich ingredients like almond or coconut flour.</p><h2>9. Reduced-Fat Peanut Butter</h2><p>I’ve been burned by “reduced fat” peanut butter more times than I can count. Sounds healthy, right? But food manufacturers remove some of those heart-healthy peanut fats and replace them with loads of added sugars and fillers to mimic the real thing.</p><p>Save yourself the confusion and opt for the natural, full-fat peanut butter. Consumed in moderation, those healthy peanut fats are actually good for you!</p><h2>10. Sports Drinks</h2><p>We run a lot of marathons, so we drink sports drinks. But our kids think it’s kool-aid. Why? Because of the sugar and colors! We are constantly reminding them not to drink our sports drinks.</p><p>It’s easy to reach for brightly-colored sports drinks after an intense workout, thinking you’re replenishing those lost electrolytes.</p><p>While athletes doing prolonged vigorous exercise may need electrolyte replacement, for the rest of us mere mortals, plain old water is the healthiest way to rehydrate.</p><p>Most sports drinks are just liquid sugar bombs in disguise.</p><h2>11. White Bread, Pasta and Rice</h2><p>I’m going to let you in on a hard truth, those pillowy soft white bread, pasta and rice products are just empty refined carbs stripped of their nutrients and fiber. They cause blood sugar spikes and provide little long-lasting energy.</p><p>Swap them for 100% whole grain varieties like hearty whole wheat bread, brown rice and whole wheat pasta to get energizing fiber and nutrients.</p><h2>12. Processed Meats</h2><p>I love curing my sandwich cravings as much as the next person, but processed luncheon meats like ham, salami and bologna are among the worst offenders when it comes to hidden unhealthy stuff.</p><p>They’re packed with sodium, preservatives and unhealthy fats that have been linked to diseases.</p><p>Choose fresh lean proteins like grilled chicken or roasted turkey breast instead.</p><figure><img title="12. Processed Meats" src="IMG/AA1o6u9E_12_processed_meats.jpg" alt="12. Processed Meats"><figcaption><em>12. Processed Meats. Provided by ChaChingQueen</em></figcaption></figure><h2>13. Canned Soups</h2><p>Canned soups seem like an easy, affordable way to get your veggies in. But beware, many varieties are shockingly high in sodium, added sugars and preservatives.</p><p>Look for low-sodium or organic canned soups with wholesome ingredients. Better yet, make your own nourishing homemade soups.</p><h2>14. Vegan Meat Alternatives</h2><p>With the plant-based movement in full force, vegan meat alternatives are everywhere these days. But many are just as heavily processed as real meat, made with artificial ingredients, isolated proteins and fillers.</p><p>They may be vegetarian, but that doesn’t make them healthy foods. Focus on wholesome plant proteins like beans, lentils and tofu.</p><h2>15. Green Juices</h2><p>Don’t be duped by the “green” hype around juices made from vegetables and leafy greens. While they may seem like an easy way to get nutrients, many green juices are still loaded with natural fruit sugars once the fiber is stripped away.</p><p>You’re better off eating your greens whole.</p><h2>16. Flavored Oatmeal</h2><p>Flavored oatmeal seems like a hearty, wholesome breakfast, but most of those flavored packets and pouches are hiding tons of added sugars and artificial ingredients.</p><p>Plain old fashioned or steel-cut oats are the better choice. Dress them up with fresh fruit, cinnamon, nuts or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.</p><h2>17. Reduced-Fat Salad Dressings</h2><p>Ordering salads seems like the ultimate diet move, so you may think you’re being virtuous by going for a low-fat or fat-free dressing. Unfortunately, those dressings often replace healthy fats with bigger amounts of sugars and artificial fillers.</p><p>A full-fat, oil-based dressing made with olive or avocado oil is the better choice for your greens.</p><h2>18. Fruit Snacks</h2><p>You may have been lured into thinking those chewy, fruity snacks are a healthy treat for your kids (or yourself!). But take a closer look, most fruit snacks are essentially gummy candies in disguise.</p><p>They’re loaded with added sugars, artificial flavors, and even some unsavory preservatives, providing little to no actual fruit.</p><p>For a truly fruit-based snack, opt for fresh whole fruits or lightly processed dried fruits without added sugars. But don’t eat too much dried fruit, since it is another food on this list!</p><h2>19. Multigrain Crackers and Chips</h2><p>Multigrain crackers and chips may sound more nutritious than their plain, refined counterparts. But many simply combine refined white and whole grains while still delivering tons of sodium and unhealthy fats.</p><p>Stick to 100% whole grain varieties made with clean, simple ingredients.</p><h2>20. Fruit Smoothies</h2><p>Surely sipping on a fruit smoothie is a great way to get nutrients, right? While smoothies can indeed pack in produce, most varieties are liquid calorie bombs made from fruit juices, sugary yogurts or sherbets, and sweeteners.</p><p>Be mindful of portions and ingredients, or better yet, eat your fruits and veggies whole!</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Food marketing can be incredibly deceptive. Just because a product claims to be “healthy” or “natural” doesn’t mean it actually is. Taking the time to scrutinize nutrition labels and ingredients lists is so important if you want to make truly nutritious choices.</p><p>My advice? Focus on eating whole, minimally-processed foods as much as possible. Load up on fresh produce, lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats and other nutrient-dense ingredients.</p><p>And when you do indulge in packaged snacks or convenience foods, read those labels diligently and opt for versions without excessive added sugars, unhealthy oils, salt and artificial additives.</p><p>Nutrition shouldn’t be complicated or stressful. By being an informed consumer and making wholesome choices most of the time, you can absolutely achieve your dietary goals without falling victim to devious “healthy” food marketing ploys.</p><p>Here’s to nourishing your body the right way!</p></main>
