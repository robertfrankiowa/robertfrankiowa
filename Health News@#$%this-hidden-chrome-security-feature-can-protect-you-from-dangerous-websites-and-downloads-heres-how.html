    <main><h1>This hidden Chrome security feature can protect you from dangerous websites and downloads — here’s how</h1><p>The web can be a dangerous place with all sorts of cyber threats you need to look out for, from downloads that might contain malware to phishing attacks designed to steal your passwords.</p><p>While using one of the best antivirus software solutions and pairing it with one of the best password managers is the ideal course of action, there are plenty of other free tools to help keep you safe online.</p><p>Back in 2007, Google released its Safe Browsing feature for Chrome to better protect users against both malware and phishing attempts. If you’ve ever seen a warning page about a deceptive site when using the search giant’s browser, this is an example of how Safe Browsing can protect you online.</p><p>To help keep you even safer though, Google released an upgraded version of this feature called Enhanced Safe Browsing. Not only does it protect you from dangerous websites and downloads, but it can also warn you about suspicious extensions or when your passwords have been exposed in a data breach.</p><p>The best part about Enhanced Safe Browsing though is that it’s completely free and you can enable it in just a few minutes. Here’s what you need to know about setting up Enhanced Safe Browsing on either desktop or mobile. </p><h2>How to enable Enhanced Safe Browsing on desktop</h2><p>For these instructions, we’re using Chrome on one of the best PCs but these steps are the same to enable Enhanced Safe Browsing on either a Mac or a Chromebook.</p><h3>1.
