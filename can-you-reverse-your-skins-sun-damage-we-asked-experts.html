However, as enjoyable as spending time in the sun may be, it's always important to be aware of protecting your skin from sun damage -- especially considering that sun exposure is a known cause of skin cancer and premature skin aging. </p><p>However, for those who have already experienced sun damage on their skin, is it possible to reverse these effects? We spoke with experts to find out more about all things sun damage. </p><h2>What is sun damage?</h2><p>"Sun damage" is a catchall phrase that refers to any harm done to your skin by the sun. It manifests in several ways, said Dr. Susan Bard, a board-certified dermatologist at Manhattan Dermatology Specialists. </p><p>"Sun damage can present as dark spots, aberrant blood vessels or ruddiness, or with skin laxity and wrinkles," Bard said. "It can also present with precancerous skin lesions that feel like little scabs on the skin."</p><p>Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, said sun damage often looks different across skin tones. "In lighter skin types, thinning of the skin, fine lines and discolorations will be apparent," she said. "In darker skin types, discolorations may be the most prominent feature of sun damage."</p><p>The technical term for these changes is "photoaging." While most people know photoaging as the face of sun damage, other types of damage can occur, depending on which type of UV ray enters the skin.</p><p>"UVA rays are generally linked to the aging of skin cells and tend to be the cause of wrinkles, sunspots and other signs of sun damage," King said. "UVB rays, on the other hand, are the principal cause of sunburns, directly damage DNA in skin cells and are linked to most skin cancers. </p><h2>Can you reverse sun damage?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by CNET" src="IMG/AA1d4PY5_gettyimages_1249064202.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1249064202"><figcaption><em>Getty Images. Provided by CNET</em></figcaption></figure><p>King and Bard both say it's possible to partially reverse -- a better word is "treat" -- some types of sun damage. If you have discoloration, wrinkles, fine lines or other characteristics of photoaged skin, a dermatologist can help you address these types of sun damage. </p><p>"It is possible to reverse [sun damage] to some extent utilizing lasers, chemical peels and certain topical medications to destroy dark spots and vessels, encourage collagen deposition and remove the damaged layers of skin," Bard said. She clarifies that combining multiple treatments is usually required to address the different components of sun damage. </p><p>Certain at-home treatments might help, too. King said humectants and emollients can hydrate and smooth the skin to keep it looking plump, which is particularly important for dry skin. Anti-aging topicals, such as retinoids, antioxidants, peptides and alpha-hydroxy acids can also help, King said. </p><p>Topical retinoids are the most proven anti-aging topical option, she said. These compounds are "very powerful and able to produce significant changes in the skin. They increase the turnover of skin cells, increase collagen production and decrease discoloration," as well as reduce pore clogging, King said.</p><h2>But don't get too excited</h2><p>While you can treat the aesthetic effects of sun damage, you unfortunately can't reduce or reverse DNA damage caused by the sun, Bard said. "Once DNA mutation has occurred due to UV irradiation, there is no way to undo that. The cell needs to be destroyed by an outside modality or by the body," she explains.</p><p>UV radiation is a known human carcinogen, King said. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, your risk for melanoma doubles if you have more than five sunburns. Just one sunburn that blisters in childhood or during your teen years can more than double your risk of developing this deadly skin cancer later on. </p><h2>How to prevent sun damage</h2><figure><img title="Provided by CNET" src="IMG/AA15bqwS_multiple_kinds_of_sunscreen_on_a_blue_background.jpg" alt="multiple kinds of sunscreen on a blue background"><figcaption><em>Angela Lang/CNET.

Daily protection is critical, King said, because "much of the sun damage that accumulates in our skin is the result of daily incidental sun exposure."</p><p>King cited an Australian study that tracked the skin of people who used sunscreen every day, regardless of the weather or their daily activities. The researchers compared this to the skin of people who only used sunscreen on particularly sunny days or when they felt they would be spending significant time outside. The results? The skin of the people who used sunscreen every day aged significantly better.</p><figure><img title="Provided by CNET" src="IMG/AA1nKJrb_cnet_health_tips_logo.jpg" alt="CNET Health Tips logo"><figcaption><em>.
