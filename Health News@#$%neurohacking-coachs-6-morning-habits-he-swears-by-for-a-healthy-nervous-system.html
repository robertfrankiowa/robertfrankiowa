    <main><h1>Neurohacking coach's 6 morning habits he swears by for a 'healthy nervous system'</h1><p><strong>Stress, anxiety, and other undesirable emotions can have long-term effects on your physical health. The same goes for a traumatic experience from your past that can cause chronic illness. </strong></p><p>More often than not, issues with the mind manifest into physical health problems that can be crippling and greatly impact your overall well-being. Similar to “unlocking trauma” with controlled breathing, regulation of the nervous system heals the body and mind.</p><h2>Nervous system coach explains link between trauma and chronic illness </h2><p>Nervous system or neurohacking coach Faith explains in one of her videos that any traumatic event can cause chronic illnesses regardless of its intensity if it isn’t processed through.</p><p>Any event in your childhood or as recent as a few months ago can get registered in your deeper mind at the time of the occurrence as it “comes at too fast,” she says. The impact remains the same in a small trauma or a big one because the person experiencing it isn’t prepared for it.</p><p>“So it sort of bypasses our conscious awareness and goes into our deeper mind, unprocessed and stuck as information,” the nervous system doctor explains.</p><p>・<strong>INTO THE FUTURE:</strong> Earth days are getting longer and a sleep expert breaks down what this means for bedtime</p><p>The deeper mind, unlike the conscious mind, doesn’t have the concept of time, so it continues to perceive the trauma as an ongoing event for the rest of your life if not worked through.</p><p>Faith says the deeper mind is the “direct line of communication to the nervous system” and thinking that we are living in trauma sends the nervous system into survival mode.</p><p>Being in survival mode causes great damage to the body, creating several health problems, such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and more.</p><p>An article published by Harvard Health Publishing states, that traumatic events that made you believe you were in danger trigger emotional and physical reactions that make you prone to several concerning health conditions including heart attack, stroke, obesity, cancer, etc.</p><h2>Morning habits to regulate your nervous system </h2><p>Faith shares 6 tips to kick-start your day which helps regulate your nervous system. These include:</p><p>1. Don’t start your day with technology as morning is the best time to “rewire your subconscious” mind by sending the message of safety. Exposure to electronics causes hindrance to the natural state of the mind, says the nervous system coach.</p><p>2. Practice gratitude first thing in the morning – being grateful for what you have conditions the mind to focus on positive things throughout the day, rather than dwelling on the negative aspects of life.</p><p>3. Visualisation, meaning, imagining what you want or how you wish your day to be “helps us fire and wire neural pathways,” says Faith.</p><p>4. Mindful breathing, also useful in breaking panic attacks, is the best habit to kick-start your day. By becoming a conscious observer of your thoughts, you can stop the mind from spiraling into despair throughout the day.</p><p>5. Intension setting is like “the cheat code to life”, according to the nervous system coach, who strongly encourages setting an intention to guide all your actions and stay focused without distractions.</p><p>6. Don’t start your day with caffeine. She claims consuming coffee before 8oz of warm water with lemon and some nutritious food is one of the major triggers of anxiety.</p><p>Faith Ashenden is a neurohacking coach, working on healing people with chronic illnesses using her journey with “years of suffering” as inspiration. She has a psychology degree from the University of Texas, is certified in the Emotional Freedom Technique, hypnotherapy, and is trained in Rapid Resolution Therapy.</p></main>
