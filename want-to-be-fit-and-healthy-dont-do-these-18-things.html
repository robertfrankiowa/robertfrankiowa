    <main><h1>Want To Be Fit and Healthy? Don’t Do These 18 Things</h1><p>There’s an endless scroll of advice on what to do to be healthy, fit, and fab. But what about what not to do? We all love being given a handy “not to-do list”—there’s a slight thrill in rebellion against what we’re told not to do, like having dessert before dinner. But regarding our well-being, this list might save you from a future of kale-induced shudders and treadmill shudders alike.</p><p>Health and fitness are lifelong pursuits, and misinformation can set you on an ineffective and sometimes harmful path. With a mix of humor and science, here’s a list of 18 health no-nos guaranteed to make your wellness routine a bonafide no-fly zone if they’re part of your regimen.</p><h2>Starvation as a Shortcut to Slimness</h2><p>Cutting calories can be a good plan. Cutting meals? Not so much. You might fit into those skinny jeans, but the aftertaste of fainting spells isn’t chic at all. It can mess with your metabolism and lead to an unhealthy relationship with food. Not to mention, it makes you hangry—a lethal mix of hungry and angry not appreciated by bystanders.</p><h2>Living in the Gym (Seriously, Get Out)</h2><p>First, living in the <strong>gym</strong> is how fitness instructors are born, not you. Spending every waking moment in a sweat mecca can lead to burnout and, oddly enough, fewer gains than you’d expect. Your body needs rest, recovery, and a life outside those walls. Trust me, that mysterious thing called fresh air could help more than you think.</p><figure><img title="Living in the Gym (Seriously, Get Out)" src="IMG/BB1jjPdc_living_in_the_gym_seriously_get_out.jpg" alt="Living in the Gym (Seriously, Get Out)"><figcaption><em>Living in the Gym (Seriously, Get Out). </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Assuming Organic is the Only Way</h2><p>Organic food is great—if you can afford it. But remember, the regular stuff you get in the other aisle still grows in the ground and is pumped full of nutrients. Don’t sweat it if you can’t go whole organic. Sweat it out on the exercise mat instead.</p><figure><img title="Assuming Organic is the Only Way" src="IMG/BB1jiPv6_assuming_organic_is_the_only_way.jpg" alt="Assuming Organic is the Only Way"><figcaption><em>Assuming Organic is the Only Way.

An iron pill won’t make you Iron Woman, no matter how cool that sounds. Focus on getting nutrients from real food before turning your kitchen counter into a CVS aisle.</p><h2>Obsessing Over That Number</h2><p><strong>Your weight</strong> is just one piece of the puzzle, like the corny edges of a jigsaw. Your health is a big picture of how you feel, your energy levels, and how your clothes fit. Scales can’t measure your joy, so why sweat it if you’re two pounds heavier from water weight after a salty binge?</p><h2>Treating Water Like a Nemesis</h2><p>Water is not just for the algae in your fish tank. Dehydration is the antithesis of good health. Yet, some treat water like a chore. Here’s a fun fact: unlike in algebra, you can never get too much water. Your skin, your organs, and your brain all need it. Get that agua, champ.</p><p>The <strong>Institute of Medicine of the National Academies</strong> recommends drinking 2.7 liters (91 ounces or 11 cups) of water daily for adult women and 3.7 liters (125 ounces or 15 cups) for men.</p><h2>The Fast Food Faux Pas</h2><p>Now, I’m not telling you to swear off <strong>fast food</strong> forever. But if you’re hitting the drive-thru more times than not, you’re pumping your body full of calories with a shortage of nutrients. Think of it as putting regular fuel in a car that runs optimally on premium—it won’t do you or your car any good. It’s all about balance, my friends.</p><h2>Thinking Cardio is the One True Path</h2><p>Is cardio good for you? Yes. Is it the be-all and end-all of fitness? No. Strength and resistance training sculpt and protect that inner machinery of yours. Mix it up with some weights, and you’ll be more than ready for any fitness and health quest that comes your way.</p><h2>Banishing Carbs to a Desert Island</h2><p>Carbophobia strikes again! Carbohydrates are not your foe unless you train for the Couch Potato Olympics. Whole grains, fruits, and veggies are good carbs. Remember, a life without pizza is not a life worth living.</p><h2>Skipping Out on Zs</h2><p>The Z is not just a high-scoring Scrabble letter; it’s your ticket to recovery. Skimping on sleep is like not charging your phone overnight and then being surprised when it dies on you by noon. Sleep deprivation affects everything from your mood to your appetite regulation. Catch those Zs, folks.</p><figure><img title="Skipping Out on Zs" src="IMG/BB1jmyOG_skipping_out_on_zs.jpg" alt="Skipping Out on Zs"><figcaption><em>Skipping Out on Zs.

Exercise, meditation, a good book—different strokes for different stress blobs. Find what works for you, and don’t sweat the small stuff. Or the big stuff.</p><h2>Becoming a Bootcamp Junkie</h2><p>Bootcamps can be intense, like gummy bear flavors. Just because something is extreme doesn’t mean it’s best. Pushing too hard too soon can lead to burnout, injury, or overtraining syndrome. Slow and steady might not sound as cool, but it’s the turtle that wins this race.</p><h2>Overdosing on Protein</h2><p>Protein is praised, but worshipping at this altar is not the solution. Your body can only synthesize so much. The rest? It goes the way of excess—either out the other end or burdening your kidneys. Aim for a balanced diet instead.</p><h2>Exercise as Punishment</h2><p>Have you ever heard of a “penitential workout”? Me neither. Exercise should celebrate what your body can do, not a punishment for what you ate or because you ‘skipped leg day.’ You’ll see better results and feel better about your workouts when they come from a positive place.</p><h2>Ignoring Mental Health</h2><p>Your mind and body are like wings on the same butterfly—both must be in tip-top condition for a graceful aerial flight. Speaking to a pro about your <strong>mental health</strong> should be as regular as seeing a vet about your pet’s health. It’s all about wellness, and mental health is a big part.</p><h2>Avoiding All Fats</h2><p>Cutting out all fats is like trying to play Mario without coins. Your body needs fats for energy, cushioning, and to help absorb key nutrients. Avoid the bad ones (trans-fats and excessive amounts of saturated fats) and stock up on the good (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated).</p><h2>The One-Diet Wanderer</h2><p>They’re the Icelandic volcano of the dieting world—powerful for a moment, then you don’t hear about them for years. The one-diet wonders (think grapefruits and cabbage soup) are not your long-term buddies. Sustainable changes make up a healthy lifestyle, not quick fixes that are tough to maintain.</p><h2>Not Seeing a Doc Regularly</h2><p>If your car can get a regular check-up, so can you. And you’re more valuable than any vehicle. Regular check-ins with your doctor can catch issues before they become problems and help you stay on the path to wellness, whatever that looks like for you.</p><h2>12 So-Called Healthy Habits That Are Actually Really Bad For You</h2><p>Hey there, health buffs!
