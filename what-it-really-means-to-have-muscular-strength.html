    <main><h1>What It Really Means to Have Muscular Strength</h1><p><strong>THERE ARE TWO </strong>fitness goals that are shared by most gym regulars: building muscle, and gaining muscular strength. </p><p>Though the two often come in tandem, there’s a difference between gaining muscular <em>strength</em> and gaining muscle <em>size</em>. You might think muscular strength is simply expressed in the amount of weight you can move. There’s some truth to that, but it’s not the whole story. And, if pushing heavy weight is higher on your goal list than bulking up, you’ll want to understand that difference. </p><figure><img title="South_agency - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1hgsme_how_to_improve_muscular_strength.jpg" alt="How to Improve Muscular Strength"><figcaption><em>Building strength is the main goal of many gym goers.

Here, our experts know exactly what muscular strength is, and how to train for it. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>What Is Muscular Strength? </strong></h2><p class="body-text">Muscular strength, according to the National Strength and Conditioning Association's definition, is the maximum amount of force that can be generated by a muscle or muscle group, regardless of the time it takes. </p><p>That depends largely on the size of your muscle fibers, as well as your brain’s ability to activate them. The more large fibers that fire, the more force you’re going to be able to push and pull (expressed in weight room terms as exercises like the squat and deadlift). Muscular strength is often looped in with two other aspects of muscle performance: muscular endurance and muscular power. </p><h4 class="body-h4">What Is Muscular Endurance? </h4><p>“Muscular endurance is how well your muscles can perform contracts all for an extended period of time,” says Eric Sung, C.S.C.S.. If you’re closing out an arm day with a set of light triceps extensions of 20 or more repetitions, you’re working on muscular endurance. Another way to think about this is that you're pushing your muscle to perform longer, contracting it up until the point it fatigues and reaches technical failure. </p><h4 class="body-h4">What Is Muscular Power? </h4><p>Muscular power also has to do with time, but it’s about how much force you can exert quickly, Sung says. Throw back to your high school physics class. The equation for power is the amount of work done divided by the amount of time it takes to do. Think about a classic power-based exercise, like the barbell clean. This requires a very quick, forceful movement to lift the barbell. The more load someone can clean in a quick repetition, the more muscular power they have. </p><p>While all related, these different aspects of muscular performance are trained and utilized in different ways. Having great muscular endurance will be more important for a marathon runner. A powerlifter will focus his workouts on muscular power. A gym goer aiming for functional fitness will emphasize muscular strength. There are ways to tailor your training to train these different components. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Benefits of Muscular Strength </strong></h2><h4 class="body-h4">Joint Stability </h4><p>Muscles help stabilize the joints, says Sung. “Think about it like a building. Strong muscles around the joints act like the backbone of the building.” </p><p>The stronger your muscles, the more they’re able to fight against forces that are placed on them. The muscles that surround the joints absorb a portion of shock that radiates through them as we walk, run, and jump. This helps minimize wear and tear on the joints. </p><h4 class="body-h4">Reduce Injury Risk </h4><p>Better joint support means a lower risk of injury. When an unexpected force is applied to our joints, such as when we fall, our muscles are the first line of defense. If they’re strong enough, they’ll ensure the ligaments and tendons that hold everything together don’t strain or tear. </p><p>Muscular strength is built from strength training, which also promotes better bone density. The more dense our bones, the less risk they have of breaking. "That's a pro that coincides especially with the elderly population, [by] reducing the risk of falls, and increasing the chances of [being able to] get up after a fall," says Sung.</p><h4 class="body-h4">Better Posture </h4><p>Our back and core muscles work together to keep our spine strong against the load of gravity when we’re sitting or standing. Stronger muscles will help maintain posture, Sung says. Having a better posture keeps our spine healthy, promotes digestion, improves our lung capacity, and helps our balance. </p><h4 class="body-h4">Enhance Quality of Life </h4><p>Strong muscles “makes daily activities easier to do,” Sung says. Whether you’re pushing a wheelbarrow doing yard work, walking up a flight of stairs, or opening a stuck lid on a jar—you’ll perform better with greater muscular strength. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>The Top Exercises to Build Muscular Strength </strong></h2><p>You can only increase your muscular strength through resistance training. Resistance training involve loading your muscles against some kind of force—be it against weights like barbells or dumbbells, your own body weight, or gravity. </p><p>All strength training exercises are great for building muscular strength, so long as you do them with the correct sets and reps. Different rep schemes will work different aspects of muscular performance. For example, sets with lots of reps will work muscular endurance, as we’re focusing on how long a muscle can work for. Reps that are moved quickly will work muscular power—this is often done with few reps, as moving at a quick pace can be very fatiguing. Somewhere right in the middle is where you’ll find the gold standard for muscle strengthening. To build muscular strength, you’ll want to work at a lower volume with a heavy loads. </p><p>Compound exercises are "going to give you better bang for your buck," says Sung, when it comes to building muscular strength. These movements work through multiple muscle groups at once, meaning you’re working more components of your body in a single exercise. Here are a handful of our favorite compound exercises for building muscular strength.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Barbell Back Squat </strong></h4><p><strong>WHY: </strong>Squats are one of the most touted compound exercises. The movement originates from the hips and knees which fires up the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and core—all while depending on the back muscles to be engaged to support the load. If you don’t have a squat rack available to you, or want to emphasize specific muscle groups, there are tons of squat variations you can do to better support your training. </p><p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p><ul><li>Begin by ducking under the bar and placing it across your upper back—avoid placing it on your neck. Create tension across your lats and mid-back as you grip the bar.</li><li>Straighten out the knees to unrack the bar and take a step back. Place the feet slightly wider than shoulder-width.</li><li>Push your butt back and bend your knees, as if you're sitting back into a chair. Keep your core engaged to keep your chest tall.</li><li>Lower until thighs are just lower parallel to the ground, or as your mobility allows. Maintain your gaze just in front of you. Push back up with your weight evenly distributed through your feet.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Sets and Reps: Aim for 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps. </em></strong></p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Deadlifts </strong></h4><p><strong>WHY:</strong> Deadlifts are a "really functional movement that everyone should be able to do whether it relates to picking up groceries, etc, are all daily life activities the deadlift will help with," Sung says. Deadlifts build up strength of the hip hinge motion, and they can be loaded up with several different kinds of equipment. </p><p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p><ul><li>Start with your feet about shoulder-width apart under the bar. Your shins should be close to or actually touching the bar.</li><li>Push your butt back and hinge at the waist to bend down to grab the bar on either side of your legs. Grasp it in both hands using an overhand grip.</li><li>Make sure your hips are lower than your shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together to straighten out your spine, pulling the slack out of the bar.</li><li>As you pull the weight up, keep the bar close into the body. Squeeze the glutes until your shoulders, hips, and knees are all stacked on top of each other.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Sets and Reps: </em></strong><strong><em>3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps to start</em></strong></p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Pushups</strong></h4><p><strong>WHY:</strong> The pushup is a standard bodyweight exercise that strengthens way more than the chest. The exercise is very scalable, making it a great pick for anyone to add to their routine, Sung says. There are plenty of varieties for different points of focus, too.</p><p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p><ul><li>Start in a high plank position with your hands on the floor, wrists stacked beneath your shoulders, with your spine in straight line.</li><li>Think about screwing your hands into the ground. Keep your neck in a neutral position directly below you.</li><li>Lower the chest to the ground with your elbows about 45 degrees away from your body.</li><li>Push all the way up.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Sets and Reps: 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps</em></strong></p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Inverted Row</strong></h4><p><strong>WHY:</strong> Master the inverted row to build back strength. Maintaining the straight body position will also require glute and core engagement, too, so you’re firing up more than just your back. </p><p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p><ul><li>Find the bar placement that's best for your ability. The higher you place the bar, the easier this movement will be.</li><li>Grab the bar with an overhand grip, a little wider than shoulder width. As you pull up, it's crucial to maintain a straight spine throughout the entire move. Do this by squeezing your abs, glutes, and shoulder blades.</li><li>Think about pulling the bar to your chest. Don't arch your back to reach the bar.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Sets and Reps: </strong><strong>3 sets of 6 to 8 reps</strong></em></p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>Lunges</strong></h4><p><strong>WHY: </strong>Lunges are a great exercise to begin unilateral training, which is great for correcting strength discrepancies between your right and left side, promoting balance. They engage your quads, glutes, and core, and can be loaded up with whatever equipment you have available.</p><p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p><ul><li>Start in an athletic stand with your feet hip-width apart.</li><li>Step one foot forward, sinking the back leg down with it until you hit 90 degrees in both knee joints. Keep your chest tall.</li><li>Drive through the front heel to return your forward leg back to the standing position.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Sets and Reps: </strong><strong>3 sets of 6 to 8 reps per leg</strong></em></p><p><strong>WHY:</strong> The classic bench press does more than just strengthen the chest. Powering the bar up depends on the triceps, and you'll need to lock in on the bench by engaging your mid-back and core. Your deltoids help stabilize through the shoulder, too. </p><p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p><ul><li>Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the ground. Keep your glutes engaged, and tighten up your core by thinking about squeezing your belly button back towards your spine.</li><li>Start with the barbell or dumbbells directly over your shoulders. Inhale as you lower, think about creating a 45 degree bend in your arm pits. Keep your forearms perpendicular to the ground.</li><li>Exhale as you press up.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Sets and Reps: </strong><strong>3 sets of 6 to 8 reps</strong></em></p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
