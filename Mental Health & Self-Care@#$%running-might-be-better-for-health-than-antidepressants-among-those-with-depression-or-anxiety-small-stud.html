That’s the estimated number of adults in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lifetime, according to a Gallup poll published earlier this year. This is the highest percentage ever recorded by Gallup, which recorded a previous record-high of 28.6% in 2021.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Key Background</h2><p>Studies have previously suggested that exercise could be more effective for depressive or anxiety disorders than antidepressants. A report published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine in February, which included more than 2,000 participants across 41 similar studies, found that exercise was effective when treating depression and depressive symptoms and should be offered as a treatment option. Michael Craig Miller, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, suggested exercise can work “as well” as antidepressants for treating depression, though he added, “exercise alone isn’t enough for someone with severe depression.” The World Health Organization also promotes exercise for improving mental health when complemented with medication.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Further Reading</h2><p>The Best Treatment For Depression?
