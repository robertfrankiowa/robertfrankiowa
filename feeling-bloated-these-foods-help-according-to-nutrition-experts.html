    <title>Feeling Bloated? These Foods Help, According to Nutrition Experts</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Diversify your plate with these nutritious picks and say goodbye to post-dinner discomfort. When your belly is distended and hard—whether it’s that time of the month or you overindulged at dinner—the last thing you want to do is eat more. But there are, believe it or not, some foods that help ease bloating, according to experts and research. Meet the Experts: Marissa West, ACE-certified personal trainer and nutrition specialist and founder of West Kept Secret, Cindy Kasindorf, certified nutritional health counselor and founder of Remedy Organics, and Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Bloating can be caused by consuming foods that produce more gas than others, contain a high salt content, eating or drinking too quickly, or consuming carbonated drinks,” explains Marissa West, ACE-certified personal trainer and nutrition specialist and founder of West Kept Secret. “It can also be caused by a lactose intolerance, dairy aversion, or another health condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease.” Depending on the cause of your bloat, certain foods can help you get relief by reducing inflammation, activating the release of digestive enzymes, or coaxing the bloat through your digestive tract with water and fiber. Check out the below options and keep them at the ready for the next time discomfort strikes.">

    <main><h1>Feeling Bloated? These Foods Help, According to Nutrition Experts</h1><h2>Yogurt</h2><p>“Yogurt is packed with probiotics, which plays a key role in gut health and reduces bloating,” says West. The probiotics are healthy bacteria that help maintain a balanced gut microbiome—they also feed off of (and therefore help break down) prebiotic foods like asparagus, garlic, onions, and wheat.</p><h2>Ginger</h2><p>Ginger is an ancient remedy for stomach problems because it soothes inflammation in the gut, says Cindy Kasindorf, certified nutritional health counselor and founder of Remedy Organics. According to a 2018 systematic review published in <em>Food Science & Nutrition</em>, the root was found to relieve gas, fight acid reflux, reduce intestinal cramping, and prevent indigestion, and bloating. </p><h2>Cucumber</h2><p>Cucumbers are high in potassium, per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and potassium is an electrolyte that lessens the effects of sodium, per the American Heart Association. As we know, super salty foods increase bloating risk, so nomming on some cucumbers after crushing a bag of chips may balance the scales.</p><h2>Oats</h2><p>Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, says oats are a food that should alleviate bloating thanks to their stores of fiber—specifically, beta-glucan, which is an anti-inflammatory fiber that can give your puffiness a one-two punch.</p><h2>Celery</h2><p>Celery is ultra-high in water and can boost your hydration levels with a satisfying crunch rather than a slog through a bottle of H20. With this and its fiber content, it can decrease bloating by maintaining healthy digestive movement. Celery also contains antioxidants that may help combat gut inflammation.</p><h2>Bananas</h2><p>Bananas are a bloat-battling triple threat: They’re high in the electrolyte potassium, which makes them hydrating and sodium-combatting. They’re also a prebiotic, which provides food for your gut’s healthy bacteria. Lastly, they’re fibrous, which makes them great for digestion in general. In fact, research published in <em>Anaerobe</em> found that participating women who ate a banana before each meal ultimately felt less bloated than those who didn’t.</p><h2>Mint</h2><p>Mint is a known herbal remedy for digestive discomfort, and Kasindorf says its soothing properties help reduce bloating. A 2019 meta-analysis found peppermint oil to be effective in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including bloating.</p><h2>Fennel</h2><p>Fennel and its many forms (root veggie, leafy topping, crunchy seeds) have all been found to aid digestive health in some way. The seeds are a mainstay in herbal medicine to treat bloating and menstrual cramps, and the veggie itself is full of gut-loving fiber and water, which is why West recommends it as a bloating-friendly food.</p><h2>Apple cider vinegar</h2><p>Kasindorf recommends apple cider vinegar for bloating because it contains probiotics that may “stimulate digestion and promote the breakdown of food.” You can use it in a homemade salad dressing or mix a tablespoon or two into a glass of water.</p><h2>Grapefruit</h2><p>Grapefruit “contains enzymes that can aid in digestion and reduce inflammation in the gut,” says Kasindorf. Grapefruit seed extract, she adds, “has antimicrobial properties that can help to eliminate harmful bacteria in the gut that may contribute to bloating.”</p><figure><img title="Grapefruit" src="IMG/AA1aASXi_grapefruit.jpg" alt="Grapefruit"><figcaption><em>Grapefruit.

They also contain a particular fiber called pectin, which can support the gut microbiome and improve digestion. </p><figure><img title="Apples" src="IMG/BB1lFRm5_apples.jpg" alt="Apples"><figcaption><em>Apples.

A 2018 meta-analysis found it to have a small positive effect on IBS symptoms, which include bloating.</p><h2>Quinoa</h2><p>Quinoa, recommended by Prest, is a gluten-free grain that can satisfy your carb craving without wreaking havoc on your stomach. It also contains antioxidants that could be anti-inflammatory to the gut.</p><figure><img title="Quinoa" src="IMG/AA1aB0Yw_quinoa.jpg" alt="Quinoa"><figcaption><em>Quinoa.

Additionally, pineapples contain a natural digestive enzyme called bromelain, which aids in the breakdown of food in the GI tract.</p><h2>Kombucha</h2><p>Kombucha is a fermented drink, often made of tea and fruit. Fermented foods and drinks contain probiotics, some of which have been shown to help reduce bloating and improve bowel movement frequency. Additionally, fiber-enriched kombucha was found to combat incomplete bowel emptying in one study conducted on a group of 40 women.</p><figure><img title="Kombucha" src="IMG/BB1lFB26_kombucha.jpg" alt="Kombucha"><figcaption><em>Kombucha. Stefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Lemon</h2><p>Lemon is alkalizing, meaning it can “help balance your body’s pH, stimulate digestive enzymes, and improve digestion,” says Kasindorf. A 2022 study published in the <em>European Journal of Nutrition </em>also found lemon juice to speed up gastric emptying when compared to tea and water.</p><h2>Kiwi</h2><p>Kiwi has been studied as a digestive aid for those with IBS and constipation, and has been found to have laxative effects. It’s also a hydrating fruit, and contains protective antioxidants. </p><h2>Green tea</h2><p>Green tea contains antioxidants called catechins that are easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, research shows, making it a key tool in boosting gut health and preventing bloating. The drink also contains caffeine, a natural laxative that can help you achieve that emptied-out feeling. </p><h2>Asparagus</h2><p>Asparagus contains prebiotic fiber that helps feed the probiotic bacteria your gut needs to thrive. When your microbiome thrives, the chances for bloating diminish.</p><h2>Should I eat if I’m bloated?</h2><p>While you should listen to your body and hunger cues, there are foods that can help with bloating, as noted above. “If gas and bloating are a common occurrence for you, work with a registered dietitian to troubleshoot which foods cause the most symptoms,” recommends Prest. “We often start by eliminating foods that are high in FODMAPs (short-chain carbohydrates) for a period of time and then do a reintroduction phase to determine which foods are most troublesome for you.”</p><h2>Foods to avoid for bloating</h2><p><strong>Trigger foods: </strong>“If you run into a hard, puffy stomach quite often, it may be due to certain food intolerances,” Taz Bhatia, M.D., an integrative health expert and founder of CentreSpring MD previously told <em>Prevention</em>. “I always recommend keeping a food journal in these cases. Being able to go back and see which foods seem to cause these types of symptoms can keep a bloated belly at bay.”</p><p><strong>Gluten:</strong> “Even if you don’t have celiac disease, ingesting less wheat often improves gas symptoms if you have an intolerance to gluten in wheat, rye, and barley,” Patricia Raymond, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Norfolk, VA previously told <em>Prevention</em>.</p></main>
