This high-fat, high-protein food, made from peanuts, benefits those with nutritional deficiencies or insufficient protein intake. But what impact can it have on our health?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Does Eating Peanut Butter Make You Lose Weight?</h2><p>A study has shown that consuming peanuts or peanut butter for breakfast can reduce appetite and lower blood sugar levels for up to 12 hours compared to those who abstain. Peanuts in the peanut butter, through the processing method, have their cell walls destroyed, reducing the intestinal absorption rate of carbohydrates, which leads to a decrease in blood sugar levels. Despite common assumptions about its potential harm, it does have benefits in weight loss.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Surprisingly, it is Rich in Various Nutrients</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1jDnl9_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood2022202207119da3f89f63d5da4c09cb79e2b5321787jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2022/20220711/9da3f89f63d5da4c09cb79e2b5321787.jpg"><figcaption><em>.

However, it is necessary to carefully check the nutritional information and additive information, as sodium and sugars can be harmful.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Isn’t It High in Calories?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1jDyX6_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood2022202207111768309b5a64f9c2c447311128f223fcjpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2022/20220711/1768309b5a64f9c2c447311128f223fc.jpg"><figcaption><em>.

However, consuming a moderate amount can stimulate fat burning. This is because the unsaturated fatty acids in peanut butter activate brown fat tissue, generating heat and helping burn calories. Additionally, Its high-fat, high-protein composition enhances satiety and meal satisfaction, aiding in losing weight.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can I Eat Any Peanut Butter?</h2><p>When purchasing peanut butter, it is essential to check the ingredients. Choosing 100% peanut butter is ideal, although its thick texture might be off-putting. Conversely, products with too much sugar, such as jam or chocolate, should be avoided as they can affect weight and blood sugar levels.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Potential Risks</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1jDpFx_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood2022202207113b48b652272d979d54bc346bb9a04e17jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2022/20220711/3b48b652272d979d54bc346bb9a04e17.jpg"><figcaption><em>.

Moreover, peanuts can also combine with minerals such as zinc and iron, which can hinder absorption. Excessive peanut butter consumption can cause these problems, and if you feel discomfort after eating beans, it’s better to avoid peanut butter.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Much Should I Eat?</h2><p>While peanut butter offers health benefits, overconsumption is a no-go! The recommended daily intake is 2 teaspoons; using a measuring spoon is best. Daily peanut butter consumption poses no health risks when paired with a balanced meal.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">It Keeps You Full When Eaten For Breakfast</h2><p>When you eat peanut butter with a simple breakfast, you can feel prolonged satiety compared to those who don’t. Although peanut butter is high in fat, it is rich in protein and fiber, and most of it is monounsaturated fat, which helps to clear the blood and clean the blood vessels.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Eat Peanut Butter Healthily</h2><p>For a healthier alternative, homemade peanut butter is recommended. You can make it simply and healthily by adding oil, salt, and plant syrup. Just roast the peanuts in an oven or dry pan and grind them in a blender. The oil inside them will melt out, and the butter will be ready.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Look Out for When Buying and the Correct Storage Method</h2><p>Buying organic products and checking the ingredient list is best when purchasing peanut butter. It is essential to check if it contains sugars and food additives! Peanut butter can be stored for about a month at a cool, sun-free room temperature, and it is best to refrigerate after opening. Products without additives are especially recommended for refrigeration.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Tell If Peanut Butter Has Gone Bad</h2><p>If the peanut butter you’ve been storing has darkened, hardened, or dried out, it’s best to throw it away. You can also tell by the smell; if the buttery scent has faded or it smells bad, it’s best to discard it regardless of the expiration date. If there are signs of discoloration or mold, never consume it! The mold common in peanut butter is aflatoxin, which is classified as a carcinogen.</p><p>By. Jeon Shin Young</p></main>
