Provided by Daily Mail</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Pre-workouts</h2><p class="mol-para-with-font">Described by Mr Hobson as a 'kitchen sink supplement', it is made with lots of products 'thrown into the mix'.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">But despite it containing a wide range if ingredients, it is not always necessary, Mr Hobson warns and suggests simply eating a banana or having a coffee for the same effect. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some pre-workout supplements, which are often sold as an all-in-one powder, are made with glucose and caffeine.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Hobson says these could be worth your time as the glucose will give you the energy boost and fuel for a workout and the caffeine will improve mental alertness and performance.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Beyond that, many of the other elements are not really necessary, especially for gym goers,' Mr Hobson said.  </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Some pre-workout supplements also contain creatine and beta alanine, which is an amino acid produced in the body that plays a role on muscle endurance and high intensity exercise. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">However, for these to have an effect, they need to be taken daily. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Mr Hobson said: 'Intermittently taking them in a pre-workout is not going to be effective. </p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Sometimes the doses are also too small in accordance with the research around their effectiveness.'</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">He adds, that for the average gym goer, eating a banana and having a coffee before the gym will likely suffice as a pre-workout boost. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Daily Mail" src="IMG/BB1ldwMx_for_the_average_gym_goer_eating_a_banana_and_having_a_coffee_before_a_workout_will_suffice_as_a_pre_worko.jpg" alt="For the average gym goer, eating a banana and having a coffee before a workout will suffice as a pre-workout boost"><figcaption><em>For the average gym goer, eating a banana and having a coffee before a workout will suffice as a pre-workout boost.
