    <main><h1>How Losing Weight Can Impact Hormones and Help You Manage PCOS</h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common health condition, impacting 1 in 10 women of reproductive age, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. PCOS can affect people in a variety of challenging ways, including causing sleep issues, mood disorders, acne, and infertility.</p><p>While the causes of PCOS are complex and still not fully understood, researchers believe that being at a higher weight or having obesity may be one trigger for PCOS among people whose genetics place them at an increased risk of developing the condition.</p><p>Here, experts explain how weight impacts PCOS — and why losing even small amounts of weight may help reduce PCOS symptoms.</p><h2>How Hormones, PCOS, and Weight Are Connected</h2><p>The exact cause of PCOS is still up for debate, though environmental and genetic factors likely both play a role.</p><p>Obesity, insulin resistance (a condition where the body stops responding to the hormone insulin), and other metabolic disorders (conditions that occur when something goes wrong with the chemical processes that convert food into energy) have been identified as potential causes of PCOS, notes the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>“PCOS is a metabolic disorder that happens to have a hormonal component,” says Wendy Warner, MD, a functional medicine gynecologist in private practice and an educator for the Institute for Functional Medicine.</p><p>Research suggests a link between excess adipose (fatty) tissue and PCOS. In particular, having greater amounts of body fat may affect how you metabolize steroid hormones like cortisol and testosterone, leading to a hormone imbalance.</p><p>Carrying excess weight also causes chronic inflammation, creating its own issues. “I call inflammation the ‘great hormone mess-maker,’ as it impacts nearly all hormones’ efficacy. You can see wide, sweeping effects for metabolism and hormone imbalance in people with PCOS,” says Brooke Kalanick, ND, a functional medicine practitioner in New York City who specializes in women’s hormone health.</p><h2>Insulin Resistance and PCOS</h2><p>Insulin resistance (a precursor to type 2 diabetes) affects 50 to 70 percent of people with PCOS, per research. However, insulin resistance may <em>cause</em> PCOS — not the other way around.</p><p>“Sometimes, when we over-consume carbohydrates like bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes, insulin builds up in the bloodstream and creates a situation in the ovaries where instead of estrogen being the primary hormone, testosterone becomes the primary hormone,” says Maureen Whelihan, MD, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist with Elite GYN Care in Greenacres, Florida.</p><p>Because insulin plays a central role in regulating blood sugar and determining how the body stores sugar and fat, insulin resistance can make it challenging to reach and maintain a healthy weight. In fact, multiple studies show an association between insulin resistance and weight gain.</p><h2>How Weight Loss May Improve PCOS Symptoms</h2><p>Research shows that between 38 and 88 percent of people with PCOS are overweight or obese, and weight loss is often recommended for people with PCOS who are overweight or have obesity. Per a research review, it’s often included in the treatment plan for women with obesity and PCOS who are struggling to conceive.</p><p>Even a modest drop in weight can offer significant benefits, according to research. Small changes, like a 5 to 10 percent reduction in body fat, can often work wonders in letting your hormones return to their normal processes, Whelihan says.</p><p>One study examined 68 women with obesity, PCOS, and insulin resistance who made healthy lifestyle changes, used the diabetes medication metformin for at least three to nine months, and lost at least 5 to 10 percent of their body weight. Those who had a significant weight loss (up to 22 pounds) the following year reported significant improvements in PCOS symptoms. The most common improvement reported was the return of a regular menstrual cycle.</p><p>Meanwhile, women who didn’t achieve a significant weight loss during the one-year follow-up saw no improvements in PCOS. </p><h2>Healthy Habits Beyond Weight Loss May Improve PCOS Symptoms</h2><p>Improving your PCOS symptoms may have as much to do with the lifestyle strategies you use to lose weight as the weight loss itself. </p><p>For example, eating a healthy PCOS-friendly diet that avoids excessive carbohydrates can help manage blood sugar and lower insulin resistance, per the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Warner notes it can be challenging to lose weight when your insulin is high, so you may find it’s easier to lose weight once you get your insulin levels under control. Plus, improving insulin resistance will help rebalance reproductive hormones.</p><p>However, PCOS is a complex condition that may be impacted by more than weight, including genetics. Therefore, weight loss alone may not be enough to manage PCOS. What’s more, there are multiple factors that go into reducing PCOS symptoms, including treatments to reduce excess hair growth and acne. Some women may also need help from hormone therapy medications such as birth control, the Mayo Clinic notes, or medications to treat insulin resistance or diabetes.</p><p>PCOS symptoms can always return if your weight creeps up or you revert to less healthy eating habits. “Even if your PCOS is resolved, you have a predisposition to getting it again,” Whelihan says.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>PCOS is a complex condition. While the causes of PCOS are still unclear, and some factors are out of your control, excess weight appears to play a role, which is why weight loss is often recommended to improve PCOS symptoms.</p><p>Even a modest loss of 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can offer significant benefits, as can prioritizing healthy habits such as physical activity and reducing stress.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
