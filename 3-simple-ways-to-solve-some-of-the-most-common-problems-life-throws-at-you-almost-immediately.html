We’re inevitably faced with problems throughout our day, it’s only normal. While some people ignore them or try to avoid them, others make a point to brainstorm solutions. </p><p>Productivity and mindset creator Benjamin Bailey, took to Instagram to suggest several common solutions for “quick and easy” relief from typical life struggles. </p><h2>From burnout to sadness — here are 3 key solutions that can help to solve some of life’s common problems almost immediately:</h2><h3>1. Introduce healthy people and activities into your routine to stay on track with goals, promote healthy habits, and combat low energy levels </h3><p>Being that our realities are strongly influenced by our mindset, one way to directly navigate daily struggles is to change your perspective. Whether it’s boosting your confidence or taking a more positive approach to every part of your day, changing your inner monologue can be the key. </p><p>If you’re feeling doubtful or insecure in your life choices, consider mindfulness activities that shift your mindset — or introduce new people into your life that can provide new insights and advice. </p><p>Sometimes, all we need to restructure our mindsets is the influence of healthy habits, practices, and people in our inner circle.</p><h3>2. Seek out intentional social interaction to help bolster confidence and promote healthier moods </h3><p>With a modern-day epidemic of loneliness, many are struggling with feeling alone in their daily lives, affecting things like productivity at work, self-confidence, and interpersonal connections. “Calling a friend can offer support and a sense of connection,” Bailey suggested. “Or send me a DM.” </p><p>Meaningful social interaction or even something like connecting with a friend can feel overwhelming, especially if you spend most of your time alone. Instead of taking on the commitment of the latter, others suggest implementing a “daily kindness rule” — where you give out compliments or strike up a conversation with a stranger. </p><p>As social creatures, we’re inherently yearning for connection. So, if you’re feeling exhausted, lonely, or upset, try getting out of the house for a little bit. Of course, if you're feeling anxious — Bailey suggested looking for the closest dog and giving them a pet. “They can release calming hormones like oxytocin,” which help to stabilize your mood and promote a happier attitude. </p><p>If you’re feeling unfocused or overwhelmed at work, Bailey suggested going for a run or walk outside to help boost endorphins. UC Davis Health studies noted that not only is going outside helpful for increasing concentration, but it can also promote a happier attitude throughout the day. </p><p>If burnout continues in your life, consider taking a longer break from work to get intentional rest, while still incorporating the daily habit of immersing yourself in “the tranquility” of nature. With 73% of adults admitting stress affects their overall mental health, it’s essential to promote this intentional rest — setting the reset button on your daily obligations. </p><p>For other daily struggles — like waves of sadness, an upset stomach, or insatiable hunger — there are several quick fixes that can be simple solutions. If you’re feeling sad, Bailey suggested playing some happy music to improve your mood — something research studies on musical therapy strongly agree with. </p><p>For an upset stomach, deep intentional breaths can help to cultivate the body’s natural relaxation response, and insatiable hunger can be simply targeted by a more habitual snack routine throughout the day. </p><h2>Ultimately, most of life's problems can be instantaneously solved by a mindset shift. </h2><p>Ultimately, everyone’s struggles are uniquely different and not one specific solution will work for everyone, but these suggestions might be a great start to finding targeted fixes that work for you.</p><p>Consider changing your mindset to cultivate a more healthy inner monologue and daily routine — something that can directly fix all of the problems above. </p><p><em>Zayda Slabbekoorn is a news and entertainment writer at YourTango focusing on pop culture and human interest stories. </em></p></main>
