In the midst of picking up medications, driving them to doctor’s appointments, assisting with their daily routine, managing finances and juggling personal responsibilities, such as parenting or work — caregivers often tend to neglect one essential thing: themselves. </p><p>Whether caregivers are dedicating just a few hours a week or donning the role full-time, constantly putting someone else’s needs above their own can sometimes trigger a mixture of negative emotions, says Jenna Wells, Ph.D., a psychologist at Cornell University. This, in turn, can take a significant toll on mental and emotional health. </p><p>“There are so many ways that emotional struggles can emerge in family caregivers of older adults,” Dr. Wells explains. “For example, caregivers tend to experience higher levels of anxiety due to the stress of worrying about their loved ones. In addition, caregivers might feel ambivalent, or conflicted, about the role itself, which can lead to mental health problems.”</p><p>For many caregivers, such emotions can snowball over time and lead to a specific type of burnout that mental health experts call “compassion fatigue” or “empathic distress” — “It refers to the idea of emotional contagion – where you ‘catch’ another person’s feelings. When faced with another person’s distress, you might feel distressed yourself,” Dr. Wells explains. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recognizing the signs of compassion fatigue</h2><p>Compassion fatigue is a state of distress that largely stems from caregivers facing heightened stress levels due to the high levels of empathy, energy and self-sacrifice necessary when helping others. And its occurrence, research shows, is quite common.</p><p>According to one 2018 study, 71% of family caregivers reported feeling high levels of burnout due to taking on the pain or declining health a loved one experiences and the stress associated with putting the needs of a loved one ahead of themselves. </p><p>The signs of compassion fatigue can often sneak up, especially in situations where caregivers lack emotional and physical support as they manage the day-to-day tasks of caregiving. </p><p>“Becoming highly emotionally activated and feeling overwhelmed by events or tasks that seem relatively small or minor can be a sign that someone is experiencing compassion fatigue,” Dr. Wells says. </p><p>In addition to that, caregiver burnout can also well up feelings of guilt and resentment, feeling emotionally spent or distant from the loved one, lack of sleep, loss of focus or interest in things that previously brought joy, and feelings of helplessness. This is because Caregiving can be an isolating experience, too, as it is often time-consuming, leaving little time to foster outside connections as they dedicate time to caring for a loved one.</p><p>Furthermore, feelings of compassion fatigue might be especially common among adult children, notes Dr. Wells. That’s because providing care for their parents might feel more like an “obligation” than caring for a spouse's needs, which a caregiver may view as “part of their marital duties.”</p><p>But such feelings of distress don’t develop overnight. Dr. Wells says compassion fatigue is avoidable and it starts with taking small steps toward protecting one’s mental and physical health well before hitting a breaking point. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to avoid compassion fatigue</h2><p>Devoting a large chunk of your time and energy to caregiving can feel like an all-consuming task, especially if you lack support. </p><p>Dr. Wells said that prioritizing yourself can help you preserve energy and continue to show up for your loved one.</p><p>“On an airplane, you’re supposed to put your oxygen mask on first before assisting others. The same logic applies here,” she points out. “Try to channel distressing feelings into caring, sympathetic feelings — not just for the person in your care, but also for yourself.”</p><p>Here are five steps to get you started:</p><p><strong>Take a break</strong></p><p>Stepping away from the daily routine, even if it is for a small amount of time, can feel rejuvenating.</p><p>“Even if it’s just 5 minutes a day. Go for a walk, meditate, practice deep breathing—find what works for you and make it part of your routine,” Dr. Wells says.</p><p><strong>Prioritize physical health</strong></p><p>Taking care of your physical health, meaning getting quality amounts of sleep, exercising regularly and eating a balanced and nutritious diet can “make a noticeable difference,” the psychologist adds.</p><p><strong>Set boundaries</strong></p><p>Constantly being needed by a loved one can be draining, challenging and overwhelming. Juggling too many roles and obligations can begin to feel like too much to handle realistically. </p><p>In such cases, Dr. Wells advises setting firm boundaries to protect one’s mental and physical health. </p><p>“Express your feelings and your limits using “I statements” and don’t try to assume what the other person is feeling,” she says. “This can be so tough, but remember that it will get easier over time, as you become more comfortable setting and upholding your boundaries.”</p><p><strong>Build a support network</strong></p><p>“One of the things we know from research is that social support is one of the strongest predictors of caregiver outcomes,” Dr. Wells continues. “It’s really important to reach out to loved ones for help, and best to do it before hitting a breaking point.”</p><p>She says this can be “tangible and instrumental support,” such as outsourcing certain tasks to relatives to pick up the medications from a pharmacy, assisting with changing clothes, taking your loved one to the bathroom, prepping meals, or doing a grocery run. </p><p>Joining a support group for caregivers can also be tremendously helpful, especially as it serves as an opportunity to vent and share one’s personal journey or grievances as a caregiver. </p><p>Support groups can also serve as an outlet for anticipatory grief, especially if you are caring for an aging or sick parent nearing death. </p><p><strong>Reach out to a mental health expert</strong></p><p>If you are a primary caregiver and lack social support, and the role of a caregiver is beginning to take a psychological toll on your well-being, it’s important to reach out and seek advice from doctors or caregiving community organizations.</p><p>“Remember, you are not alone, and do not hesitate to seek support from a mental health professional,” says Dr. Wells. </p></main>
