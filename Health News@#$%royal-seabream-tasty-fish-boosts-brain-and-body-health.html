Regular consumption of seabream can bring numerous benefits that positively affect our brain, body, and well-being.</p></strong><p>Royal seabream, or gilt-head bream, is a fish with exceptional taste and minimal bones. It is mainly found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Known for its delicate, slightly sweet taste, seabream is easy to prepare and excellent for health.</p><h2>Healthy and delicious</h2><p>One of the main reasons to include seabream in your diet is its nutritional properties. This fish is a source of high-quality protein, essential for tissue growth and repair in the body. It also contains omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, which benefit heart and brain health. Omega-3s help lower cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, and improve cognitive functions. People who regularly consume this fish may notice improvements in their ability to concentrate and work more efficiently mentally.</p><p>Seabream is also rich in vitamins and minerals. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and the immune system, and vitamin B12 is essential for the production of red blood cells and the maintenance of a healthy nervous system.</p><p>The antioxidants in seabream inhibit the action of free radicals, reducing the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Additionally, they slow the development of cancer cells. Meanwhile, potassium and iron are essential for the proper functioning of the body, and iodine supports thyroid health.</p><h2>How to prepare seabream?</h2><p>Seabream is said to be one of the world's tastiest fish. Its meat is juicy and delicate, white, and has very few bones that are easy to remove. This makes seabream ideal for preparing meals for children and people who fear choking on bones. It is a lean fish—100 grams of meat contains only 115 calories—and has a mild flavor, making it versatile in the kitchen.</p><p>Seabream is available in stores as fillets, whole gutted fish, and cleaned fish. It can be grilled, baked, fried, steamed, or braised. It pairs well with various seasonings, such as garlic, lemon, rosemary, or parsley. In Mediterranean countries, it is often served with olive oil, lemon, and fresh herbs, which highlight its natural flavor. In its raw form, it is also featured in sushi, where it impresses with its delicacy.</p><p><b>Read also:</b></p><p>Unlocking the myriad health benefits of sweet ground paprika</p><p>Unlock the Secret to Weight Loss and Health with Bran</p><p>White mulberry: Nature's secret weapon for weight loss and health</p></main>
