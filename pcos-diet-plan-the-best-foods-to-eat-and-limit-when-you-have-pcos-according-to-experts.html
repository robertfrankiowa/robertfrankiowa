    <main><h1>PCOS Diet Plan: The Best Foods To Eat (And Limit) When You Have PCOS, According To Experts</h1><p>If you've ever dealt with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its array of uncomfortable symptoms, you're not alone. A complex endocrine disorder, PCOS throws reproductive hormones off balance, causing about eight to thirteen percent of women of reproductive age to experience issues like irregular or missed periods, polycystic ovaries (large ovaries with many small follicles), and excess body hair, per the World Health Organization (WHO). And although there's no one-size-fits-all treatment for PCOS, sometimes, little changes can go a long way—including to your diet.</p><figure><img title="Carol Yepes - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1oSI3W_your_7_day_pcos_meal_plan_from_dietitians.jpg" alt="Your 7-Day PCOS Meal Plan, From Dietitians"><figcaption><em>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can affect insulin, blood sugar, and more.

Clare Goodwin is a registered nutritionist and founder of Ovie.io, an online clinic for PCOS support. Ana Cristina Lewis, RD, is a dietitian and owner of Functional Nutrition By Ana. </p><h2 class="body-h2">What’s the connection between PCOS and diet? </h2><p>There’s <em>a lot </em>to unpack, but PCOS is a multifaceted condition that generally affects various body processes, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity. Having a healthy and balanced diet can improve insulin levels, reduce insulin resistance and inflammation, and help you manage weight, along with less-talked-about symptoms including fatigue, intense hunger and cravings, mood imbalances, and poor gut health, says Clare Goodwin, a registered nutritionist and founder of Ovie.io for PCOS. </p><p class="body-text">Between fifty and ninety percent of women with PCOS are insulin resistant, per a study in <em>Clinical Medicine</em>—which means that the cells in the body struggle to absorb sugar from the blood. This causes blood sugar levels to spike, triggering the pancreas to produce more insulin in an attempt to help cells respond—but when the pancreas can’t keep up, blood sugar levels can reach diabetic levels, per Cleveland Clinic. Obesity exacerbates insulin resistance, creating a vicious cycle. So, making dietary changes may help improve things over time. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Best Foods To Eat For PCOS</h2><p>If your doctor diagnoses you with PCOS, consider prioritizing foods rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats, says functional nutritional dietitian Ana Cristina Lewis, RD. "When meals have sufficient protein, fiber, healthy fat, and nutrient-dense carbohydrates, it will promote satiety, support balanced energy levels throughout the day, and help avoid huge peaks and pits of blood sugar (which then helps insulin, too),” says Lewis. “By choosing whole food, high-quality versions of these foods, it will be anti-inflammatory in nature versus choosing processed, packaged versions.” </p><p>It may also be helpful to go for foods that help regulate blood sugar and have anti-inflammatory properties, Schleiger says, such as: </p><ul><li><strong>Leafy greens: </strong>Picks like spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and arugula contain antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory components that may reduce chronic inflammation. </li><li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are all low-glycemic foods that support balanced blood sugar. Avocado is a great option, too. </li><li><strong>Fatty fish: </strong>Foods like wild salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout contain a high-quality protein which is necessary for muscle repair and metabolic function, Schleiger says. </li><li><strong>Whole grains:</strong> High in fiber, options like quinoa, brown rice, oats, and barley aid in blood sugar control and may improve insulin sensitivity, per Schleiger.</li><li><strong>Legumes: </strong>Options like lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans are high in fiber and protein which can help stabilize blood sugar levels and improve satiety, which ultimately helps weight management. </li><li><strong>Nut and seeds:</strong> Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds contain protein and fiber, which support satiety and blood sugar regulation, Schleiger says. </li><li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Cruciferous vegetables contain compounds that help reduce inflammation, making broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage helpful options to add to your diet.</li><li><strong>Probiotic-rich foods: </strong>Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi can help improve your digestion and nutrient absorption, says Schleiger. </li></ul><h2 class="body-h2">Foods To Avoid/Limit When You Have PCOS</h2><p class="body-text">Avoiding or limiting certain foods can prevent the worsening of symptoms, inflammation, and insulin resistance, says Schleiger. This doesn’t mean tossing everything in your pantry, but it can help to be more cautious about consuming these foods:</p><ul><li><strong>Sugary foods and beverages: </strong>sweets, candy, pastries, sugary cereals, soda, and fruit juices with added sugar</li><li><strong>Refined carbohydrates: </strong>white bread, white rice, pasta, and baked goods made with white flour</li><li><strong>Heavily processed foods:</strong> fast foods, processed snacks, processed meats, frozen dinners, and anything with a lengthy ingredient list </li><li><strong>Alcohol: </strong>beer, wine, and spirits

<em>Maedica</em>—but making other lifestyle modifications can be helpful, too. For example, incorporating exercise throughout your day can help, Lewis says. “Ideally there is a enjoyable movement that provides a mix of cardio and strength training throughout the week without being too taxing on the nervous system,” she says. “Avoid working out after an overnight fast to avoid putting extra stress on the body.” </p><p>Practicing good sleep hygiene may also help with PCOS management, and you should try to aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night if you can, Schleiger recommends. "Poor sleep can affect insulin sensitivity, increase stress hormones, and disrupt overall hormonal balance as our bodies heavily rely on healthy circadian rhythms,” she says.</p><p>In addition to a nourishing diet, exercise, and getting plenty of sleep, try reducing your stress levels. Chronic stress can worsen PCOS symptoms and throw your hormones off balance, according to Schleiger. You can do this by journaling, deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or whatever helps quell your nervous system. While there’s no one end-all solution for PCOS, taking a holistic wellness approach can help you reduce inflammation, prevent insulin resistance, and manage conditions associated with PCOS better. </p></main>
