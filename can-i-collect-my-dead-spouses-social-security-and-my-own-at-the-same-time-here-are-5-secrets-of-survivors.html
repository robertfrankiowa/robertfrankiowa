Bricolage/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><p>While your plans for retirement might include buying an RV or traveling around the world, you should also give consideration — difficult though it may be — to what will happen when one spouse dies before the other.</p><p>One very important factor in this regard is the Social Security survivors benefits, essentially a transfer of the deceased’s retirement payout, which a widow or widower can receive once they’re 60 (or younger in certain circumstances).</p><p>As with retirement benefits, the Social Security Administration (SSA) relies on a complex set of factors (such as your age, years of work, lifetime income) in determining a surviving spouse’s eligibility and benefit entitlement.</p><p>It’s always best to consult with a financial adviser on any complicated financial subject, but to help you get an initial handle on how survivor benefits can help you and your loved ones, here are five Social Security survivor “secrets” you might not be aware of.</p><h2>No, you can’t collect two benefits at the same time</h2><p>Don’t count on receiving a double payment if your spouse passes before you. If you’re entitled to both a retirement benefit and the survivors benefit, you’ll receive only one — the larger — of the two amounts.</p><p>If the surviving spouse is at full retirement age or older, they can receive 100% of the deceased's benefit amount. If they’re between 60 and full retirement age, they’ll get between 71.5% and 99%.</p><p>To offset any social security income losses when your spouse passes, you can purchase life insurance with SBLI. Whether you opt for term or whole life insurance, SBLI can tailor policy to suit your personal requirements and financial goals.</p><p>By opting for life insurance* with SBLI you have access to features such as LegacyShield, which can ease your mind during end-of-life planning. SBLI’s LegacyShield is a streamlined dashboard where you can manage all your financial accounts, store documents and share final wishes all in one place. This takes a bit of the stress off when you’re faced with losing a spouse.</p><p>With SBLI, you can protect your financial future with the support of professional advice*, a simple online claims process and no medical exams required for term insurance.</p><h2>In some circumstances, spouses can get survivor benefits before they turn 60</h2><p>Disabled spouses 50 or older can be eligible, as can spouses of any age who are caring for a deceased person’s child younger than 16.</p><p>Incidentally, other family members may also be eligible for survivor benefits. Some examples include:</p><ul> <li>An unmarried child of the deceased who is under 18</li> <li>A stepchild, grandchild, step-grandchild or adopted child</li> <li>Parents of the deceased, 62 or older, who were dependent on the deceased for at least half of their support</li> </ul><p>If you’re unsure of what spousal benefits you qualify for and want to be prepared, WiserAdvisor* can help.</p><p>WiserAdvisor is an online platform that connects you to vetted financial advisors. After filling in some information about yourself and your finances, WiserAdvisor matches you with two to three FINRA/SEC registered financial advisers* who are best suited to help you with your financial goals.</p><p>You can view the advisors’ profiles, read past client reviews and book an initial consultation for free with no obligation to hire. With WiserAdvisor, you don’t have to worry about going it alone because you have their professional guidance* as you embark on your retirement-planning journey.</p><h2>You can still get the benefit if you’re divorced, but not if you’re remarried before 60</h2><p>A survivor can be an ex-spouse if the marriage lasted at least 10 years and the ex-spouse is at least 60 years old (or 50, if disabled).</p><p>A surviving ex-spouse is eligible for the same benefit as the surviving spouse, but it won’t impact the surviving spouse’s ability to collect survivor benefits — they will both receive the amount they’re entitled to.</p><p>However, if the ex-spouse remarries <em>before</em> the age of 60, they become ineligible to collect survivor benefits unless the marriage ends.</p><p>In situations like these leave you ineligible for the benefit, having a solid life insurance plan with a platform such as SBLI*, can take a weight off your shoulders and help you maintain financial stability.</p><h2>There isn’t a time limit</h2><p>There’s no time limit on claiming your survivor's benefits — and it could be in your best interest to wait. While you should report the death as soon as possible, you can decide when to claim survivor benefits based on what makes sense for your financial situation. For example, you may want to wait until you reach full retirement age, so you’re entitled to 100% of your late spouse’s benefit.</p><p>If one spouse earned considerably more than the other during their working life, it may make sense to delay filing for one benefit over the other.
