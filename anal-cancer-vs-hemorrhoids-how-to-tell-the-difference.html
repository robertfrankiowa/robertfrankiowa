They affect the same region of the body and share some symptoms, such as lumps in the anus and rectal bleeding.</p><p>Anal cancer develops when the cells lining the anus begin to grow abnormally. Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum or anus. It's important to known when to seek a medical evaluation, as it’s not possible to make a diagnosis based on symptoms alone.</p><p>This article will explain the key differences between anal cancer and hemorrhoids, when to see a healthcare provider, diagnosis, and treatment</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1lYOgP_a_person_meeting_with_a_healthcare_provider_in_an_office.jpg" alt="A person meeting with a healthcare provider in an office"><figcaption><em>Maskot / Getty Images.

One of the major differences is the cause of the discomfort and bleeding.</p><p><strong>Anal cancer</strong> is a condition caused by abnormal growth of the cells in the tissue lining the anus, which can lead to symptoms such as rectal bleeding, bowel habit changes, and unintentional weight loss. </p><p><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong> are swollen veins in the rectum or anus, usually caused by increased pressure in the area due to factors such as straining during bowel movements, prolonged sitting, or pregnancy.</p><p>Though both conditions may cause bleeding, the bleeding associated with anal cancer is usually persistent and is accompanied by other symptoms, such as pain. The bleeding caused by hemorrhoids is usually intermittent and notable while having a bowel movement.</p><p>Hemorrhoids are also much more common than anal cancer. About half of the population will experience hemorrhoids by the time they are 50 years old. Only about 10,000 people will be diagnosed with anal cancer each year. The lifetime risk of anal cancer is 1 in 500.</p><h2>Signs and Symptoms of Hemorrhoids</h2><p>The most common symptom of hemorrhoids is rectal bleeding, usually noticed as bright red blood on the stool or on the toilet paper after having a bowel movement. In addition to bleeding, other symptoms of hemorrhoids include:</p><ul><li>Rectal itching</li><li>Swelling around the anal area</li><li>Pain during bowel movements</li><li>A sensation that the bowels aren’t emptying (tenesmus)</li></ul><p>The severity of the symptoms can vary based on how inflamed or protruding the hemorrhoids are. Generally, these symptoms are worse when straining to have a bowel movement or sitting for a long time.</p><h2>Signs and Symptoms of Anal Cancer</h2><p>Anal cancer can present with a variety of symptoms. One of the most common symptoms is rectal bleeding. This can be seen during bowel movements or noticed in the stool. Other symptoms of anal cancer include:</p><ul><li>Changes in bowel habits, such as persistent constipation or diarrhea</li><li>The sensation of not completely emptying the bowels</li><li>Worsening pain in the anus or rectum</li><li>Lumps in or near the anus, which can grow over time</li><li>Unintentional weight loss</li><li>Fatigue</li></ul><h2>What Causes Hemorrhoids?</h2><p>Hemorrhoids develop when the veins in the rectum or anus become swollen or inflamed, usually due to increased pressure in the pelvic area. This increased pressure can occur due to a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>Straining during bowel movements</li><li>Chronic constipation</li><li>Chronic diarrhea</li><li>Sitting for long periods of time on the toilet</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Increased age</li><li>Low-fiber diet, which can lead to constipation</li></ul><h2>What Causes Anal Cancer?</h2><p>Anal cancer develops when cells in the tissue lining the anus become abnormal and grow uncontrollably. A common cause of anal cancer is infection with certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV types 16 and 18. Other risk factors for developing anal cancer include:</p><ul><li>Engaging in receptive anal intercourse</li><li>Having a weakened immune system</li><li>Smoking tobacco</li><li>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection</li><li>History of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal cancer</li></ul><p>While anal cancer is relatively rare, understanding these causes and risk factors can help individuals take preventive measures (such as vaccination for HPV) and undergo regular screening to detect any abnormalities early, improving the chances of successful treatment.</p><h2>Diagnosing Anal Cancer vs. Hemorrhoids</h2><p>The start of the process for diagnosing hemorrhoids or anal cancer begins with a thorough medical history assessing for any risk factors such as HPV infection, smoking, or a history of cancer. A physical examination of the anal region will be performed to evaluate for any lumps, growths, or other abnormalities.</p><p>During the examination, the provider may visually inspect the anal area and gently palpate to check for swelling, irritation, or lumps. In some cases, a digital rectal examination may be performed to evaluate the inside of the rectum for any abnormalities. Diagnosing hemorrhoids is usually pretty straightforward based on examination.</p><p>Additional tests may be ordered if your diagnosis is still unclear or if other severe symptoms are present. These tests may include anoscopy, during which a small tubelike instrument is placed in the anus to offer a detailed view. They may perform a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to examine the colon and rectum for other potential causes of symptoms.</p><p>If anal cancer is suspected, testing needs to be done to confirm cancerous cells are present, as well as to determine the extent of the disease. Additional diagnostic tests can include:</p><ul><li><strong>Biopsy</strong>: If suspicious lesions or abnormalities are found, a biopsy may be performed. During a biopsy, a small tissue sample is taken from the affected area and examined under a microscope to determine if cancerous cells are present.</li><li><strong>Imaging tests</strong>: Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron-emission tomography (PET), or ultrasound may be used to evaluate the extent of the cancer and determine if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs.</li><li><strong>Endoscopic procedures</strong>: Procedures like anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy may be performed to visualize the anal canal and rectum more closely and to obtain biopsies of any suspicious areas.</li></ul><p>The diagnostic process for anal cancer is extensive. An accurate diagnosis of the disease to develop an appropriate treatment plan. </p><h2>How Hemorrhoids Are Treated</h2><p>The treatment for hemorrhoids depends on the severity of symptoms and the type of hemorrhoids present. The goal is to relieve symptoms, reduce swelling, and improve quality of life.</p><p>For mild cases, self-care measures can improve symptoms and help with healing. These include:</p><ul><li>Increasing fiber intake (fruits, vegetables, whole grains) and/or taking fiber supplements to keep stools soft</li><li>Staying hydrated</li><li>Avoiding straining during bowel movements</li><li>Taking a sitz bath (soaking the bottom in a shallow tub of warm water) a few times a day</li></ul><p>Over-the-counter (OTC) topical creams, ointments, or suppositories contain ingredients like witch hazel and hydrocortisone that may help with itching, swelling, and discomfort. However, there is little clinical research that prove they are effective.</p><p>In more severe cases, medical procedures may be recommended. These can include rubber band ligation (banding), in which a small rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply, causing it to shrink and fall off.</p><p>Another procedure is sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a chemical solution into the hemorrhoid to shrink it. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove large or prolapsed (extending from the anus) hemorrhoids.</p><h2>How Anal Cancer Is Treated</h2><p>The treatment for anal cancer depends on the stage of the cancer and the person’s overall health. Treatment often involves multiple interventions, which may include:</p><ul><li>Radiation therapy</li><li>Chemotherapy (kills rapidly dividing cells)</li><li>Surgery</li><li>Immunotherapy (uses the immune system to inhibit or attack the cancer)</li><li>Targeted therapy (uses traits of the cancer cells to inhibit or attack it)</li><li>Combination of the above</li></ul><p>Some cancers affect only the anal margin (the area around the anus). If they can be removed without harming the anal sphincter, local excision can be performed. The tumor, along with a margin of healthy tissue, is removed.</p><p>Localized anal cancers that can't be removed without harming the anal sphincter are treated with chemotherapy combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). This is also used for anal cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes or tissues.</p><p>If the cancer remains after this treatment, abdominoperineal resection (APR) surgery may be recommended. This surgery removes the anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon. A colostomy creates a new opening in the large intestine and the abdomen for stool to exit the body and be collected in a bag.</p><p>Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are newer treatment options for certain types of anal cancer. These work differently than chemotherapy, as these medications use the immune system to fight the cancer or they target a particular pathway the cancer uses to grow. </p><p>The choice of treatment depends on multiple factors and is tailored to each person’s cancer, with the goal of achieving the best possible outcome while minimizing side effects and maintaining quality of life.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Although anal cancer and hemorrhoids have shared symptoms, such as rectal bleeding and lumps in the anus, they are two very different conditions with different diagnosis and treatments. Anal cancer results from abnormal cell growth in the anal tissues, while hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum or anus.</p><p>If you’re experiencing symptoms such as rectal bleeding, pain, or a lump, seek a medical evaluation promptly, as these are not symptoms of which you should self-diagnose. Healthcare providers can determine a diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. </p></main>
