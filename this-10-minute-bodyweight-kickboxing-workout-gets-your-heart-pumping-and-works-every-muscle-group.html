Hearst Owned</em></figcaption></figure><p><p class="body-text">Kickboxing isn't just about throwing punches and kicks—it's a high-intensity, full-body workout with the potential to blast calories, get your heart rate up, and build strength. And there's no better coach to lead you through an exhilarating bodyweight kickboxing session than Ari Cobb, a trainer, MMA athlete, and member of the <em>Men's Health</em> and <em>Women's Health</em> Strength in Diversity Initiative. </p><p>In this spicy 10-minute session, Cobb brings her expertise to the forefront, delivering a fast-paced routine that's guaranteed to get you sweating. Whether you're craving a heart rate-revving sweat or looking to add some fight-focused movements to your workout routine, this session is a bite-sized pick-me-up you can do just about anywhere. (You don't need a ton of time to pack in an effective sweat!)</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the expert:</strong> Ari Cobb, CPT, is a trainer and MMA athlete based in Houston, Texas.</p><p><em>Press play and follow along with Cobb:</em></p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>The Workout</strong> </h2><p>Following a minute of jump-roping to get your heart rate up (no actual jump rope required!), you'll tackle a range of kickboxing combos and conditioning movements with the intensity of a fighter. After each 45-second to 1-minute interval of continuous shadowboxing (jabs, crosses, hooks, kicks), you'll immediately roll into a 30- to 45-second burst of bodyweight cardio exercises such as lateral shuffle jumps (with low-impact options provided) and plank jacks. </p><p>Every interval is slightly different, which makes this routine a super fast one to power through. With modification cues along the way, you can push yourself to the level of intensity you desire while still maintaining proper form and technique. While there aren't any rest periods programmed into this short session, listen up for Cobb's reminders to take breaks and rest when you need to. </p><p>For this workout, all you'll need is a mat and enough space to execute throws, punches, and leg extensions. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Benefits Of Kickboxing Workouts</strong></h2><p>Kickboxing requires you to move in fast, dynamic ways, combining full-body strength and high-intensity cardio all-in-one. Even short kickboxing sessions like this one can not only help enhance overall cardiovascular fitness but also build strength, improve coordination, rhythm, balance and stability. </p><p>Our daily activities (think: walking from point A to B, bending down to pick something up) usually involve limited uses of our legs—primarily walking, sitting, and squatting. Kickboxing essentially engages the lower body in a whole new range of motions and techniques, ultimately helping to improve you agility, joint range of motion, spacial awareness, strength, all while taxing your cardiovascular system, Cobb says.
