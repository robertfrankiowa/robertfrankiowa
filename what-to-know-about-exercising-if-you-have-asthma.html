    <main><h1>What to Know About Exercising if You Have Asthma</h1><p>Asthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that affects how well air flows in and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed and narrowed airways that can make breathing more difficult during a flare. Mild asthmatics may not have significant airway changes unless a trigger is present.</p><p>When asthma symptoms flare up, you may experience shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), or chest pressure and tightness. If you experience shortness of breath, getting more exercise can seem stressful. In the past, researchers believed it was best for people with asthma to avoid exercise altogether to prevent severe asthma attacks.</p><p>However, researchers now understand that regular exercise can improve the well-being of people with asthma. For example, exercise can help condition your lungs to move oxygen in and out of the body better. Still, for some people, exercise can trigger their asthma, which is medically known as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction(EIB). If you have high-risk asthma, it’s important to be cautious about which types of exercises you perform.</p><h2>Benefits of Exercise for Asthma</h2><p>Exercise has many health benefits including improved circulation and reduced risk of chronic diseases. If you have asthma, a consistent exercise routine can help reduce how often you experience asthma flare-ups (periods where asthma symptoms are most active).</p><p>In one study, adults with mild or moderate asthma were asked to follow an exercise program that included aerobic exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes or more as well as muscle training and stretching. After 24 weeks of the program, participants had better asthma control and relied less on medication.</p><p>Exercise also helps increase blood flow to your lungs. The more you exercise, the more efficiently your lungs take in oxygen from the air you breathe. Your heart then circulates this oxygen-rich blood throughout your body, helping your muscles get the oxygen they need to keep you moving.</p><p>Asthma causes inflammation in your airways, but regular exercise may help decrease the inflammation. Certain types of exercise can even help prevent or reduce asthma symptoms by strengthening your lungs.</p><p>Consider the following benefits of exercise if you have asthma:</p><ul><li><strong>Improved stamina:</strong> Consistent exercise helps your airways build tolerance. As you get used to exercising, you may perform activities that typically leave you short of breath, like climbing stairs, more easily.</li><li><strong>Decreased inflammation: </strong>When exposed to asthma triggers, your immune system releases certain proteins. This can cause your airways to become inflamed and narrowed. Regular exercise can help decrease inflammation by reducing the levels of proteins that contribute to it.</li><li><strong>Increased lung capacity: </strong>Your lung capacity is how much air your lungs can hold. With improved lung capacity, your lungs can take in more air and use oxygen more effectively. Exercise improves your lung capacity, which means you won’t have to work as hard to breathe during daily activities.</li><li><strong>Stronger muscles: </strong>Strength training can help you build stronger muscles. In addition to overall well-being, maintaining stronger muscles may help manage asthma symptoms. For example, having low muscle mass and strength can lead to worsening asthma symptoms, poorly controlled asthma, a lower quality of life, and more frequent emergency room visits for asthma attacks.</li><li><strong>Better heart health:</strong> As you exercise, your heart gets better at pumping blood throughout your body. For people with asthma, having a stronger cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) system makes it easier for your body to receive oxygen.</li></ul><h2>Risks of Exercising With Asthma</h2><p>People who have severe asthma can still enjoy most types of exercise. However, taking certain precautions can help ensure a comfortable and safe experience. </p><p>Start by working with your healthcare provider to determine which types of exercise are best for you. Your healthcare provider can also tell you which asthma medications to take before exercising and what to do if you develop symptoms during physical activity You may need to take a short-acting bronchodilator(a medicine that opens your airways quickly) 15-20 minutes before exercising to prevent EIB.</p><p>It’s also important to pay attention to your asthma triggers during exercise. For example, if car or truck exhaust irritates your lungs, avoid exercising outside near busy roads.</p><p>Consider the following tips before exercising if you have a more severe form of asthma:</p><ul><li><strong>Gradually increase intensity:</strong> Begin any new exercise routine slowly and gradually work your way up to build more strength and endurance. This allows your body to adapt and may help prevent asthma symptoms.</li><li><strong>Know your asthma action plan:</strong> Create an asthma action plan with your healthcare provider. List the steps to take if you develop asthma symptoms during a workout, including when to use quick-relief medicine and when to seek emergency care. Keep a copy of your plan with you or on your phone, especially when exercising.</li><li><strong>Bundle up in cold weather:</strong> Cold air can trigger asthma. If you're exercising outdoors when it's chilly, cover your nose and mouth with a scarf but make sure you can still breathe comfortably. This will help keep you warm and humidify the air you breathe in.</li><li><strong>Start with a warm-up: </strong>Warming up is especially important if you have asthma or EIB. Warming up for 5-15 minutes opens up your blood vessels and prepares your airways for exercise. You can warm up by walking slowly or doing light stretches. </li><li><strong>End with a cool-down:</strong> Cooling down is just as beneficial as warming up. Light walking or stretching for about 5-10 minutes after exercise can help prevent asthma symptoms.</li><li><strong>Don’t forget your inhaler:</strong> Always keep your quick-relief inhaler with you when you exercise. You may need to use it if you start experiencing asthma symptoms while exercising.</li></ul><p>High-intensity activities that require continuous movement and effort, like soccer, basketball, field hockey, or long-distance running, may be more challenging for people with asthma. Similarly, activities in cold weather, like cross-country, skiing, and ice hockey, can worsen asthma symptoms. If you're interested in these types of sports, talk to your healthcare provider to develop a plan to manage your asthma during these activities.</p><h3>Keep an Eye on Air Quality</h3><p>Check the air quality in your area before heading outside, especially during the springtime. Limit outdoor exercise or strenuous activities when the air quality is orange. Skip outdoor activities altogether when it's red, purple, or maroon.</p><p><p>You can find your area's daily air quality index (AQI) in your local weather forecast or by using a weather app on your phone. You can also visit Airnow.gov and enter your zip code to see the current outdoor air quality in your area.</p><h2>Asthma-Friendly Exercises and Workouts</h2><p>Your asthma symptoms may present differently than someone else’s. However, researchers have identified some exercises that may be safer for people with asthma.</p><h3>Swimming</h3><p>Swimming is often a great choice for people with asthma because it typically takes place in a warm, humid environment. Moist air is less likely to trigger asthma symptoms, and swimming also helps strengthen your upper body muscles.</p><p>Be mindful that chlorine may have an irritating effect on your airways. Frequently swimming in chlorinated pools or being exposed to chlorine-based cleaning products may make some people more prone to developing asthma and other respiratory allergies.</p><h3>Walking</h3><p>Walking is an excellent form of exercise because it allows you to control your pace and intensity. The great thing about walking is that it doesn't require any special equipment, making it an accessible and free activity for most people.</p><p>You can take short walks and gradually increase your duration and speed as your fitness improves. Walking in a park or other green space can expose you to cleaner air, but check for pollen levels before heading outdoors. Alternatively, you can walk indoors or on a treadmill if you don’t live near green spaces.</p><h3>Biking</h3><p>Leisure biking at a relaxed pace, such as on a flat bike path, can be beneficial for people who have asthma. Like walking, leisure biking allows you to set your own pace and improve your heart health simultaneously. If you would rather stay indoors, a stationary bike or elliptical are also good options.</p><h3>Hiking</h3><p>Hiking can be a great way for people who have asthma to enjoy the outdoors and get some exercise. Consider hiking on trails with a gentle incline and take breaks as needed.</p><p>The fresh air and natural surroundings can also be calming and help reduce stress. It’s a good idea to go hiking with someone you know in case you need assistance.</p><h3>Yoga and Tai Chi</h3><p>Yoga and tai chi are low-impact forms of exercise that combine breathing techniques and meditation. Focusing on breath control and relaxation can greatly benefit your lung capacity.</p><p>Some yoga breathing exercises, such as pursed lip and deep breathing, can improve lung function. Beginner-level yoga classes or exercises from home can be a good way to get started. If you’re taking yoga classes, let your instructor know about your asthma so they can offer modifications if needed.</p><p>Tai chi offers many benefits, including possibly lowering blood pressure and increasing aerobic capacity (how your body uses oxygen). One review of 23 studies found that it might improve lung function in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—a group of chronic, progressive lung diseases that limit airflow to the lungs and cause difficulty breathing.</p><p>If you enjoy team sports, consider activities like baseball or football—which involve quick periods of activity followed by breaks. These sports may be better at managing your asthma symptoms compared to high-stamina sports like soccer or basketball. Sports like golf or bowling are also good alternatives.</p><p>It’s also important to always listen to your body and take breaks when you need them. If you have any concerns or questions about which exercises are right for you, have a conversation with your healthcare provider about which activities are safe for you and your overall condition.</p><h2>Managing Symptoms During Exercise</h2><p>Your healthcare provider will likely have you use a bronchodilator, like ProAir HFA (albuterol), before exercise. A bronchodilator is an inhaler that helps open your airways by relaxing the muscles around the tubes in your lungs. However, asthma symptoms can still pop up from time to time while you're working out.</p><p>Here are some other tips:</p><ul><li>If you start to have chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath during exercise, stop doing the activity immediately and relax until symptoms subside. Taking slow breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, allowing your stomach to rise as you breathe can also help your body to relax. </li><li>Get emergency help if your asthma symptoms continue or worsen even after doing breathing exercises.</li><li>Keep track of your asthma symptoms before, during, and after exercise. This can help you identify patterns and adjust your exercise plan as needed.</li></ul><p>You may find that certain types of exercise consistently trigger your asthma. In this case, you may need to modify your workout routine, such as choosing lower-intensity exercises, taking more frequent breaks, or splitting your workout into shorter sessions throughout the day. </p><p>If you notice that your asthma symptoms consistently interfere with your ability to exercise, even with quick-relief medicine, talk to your healthcare provider. Your provider may need to adjust your asthma treatment plan or provide additional guidance on managing your symptoms during exercise.</p><h2>When To See a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>When you're exercising with asthma, there are a few signs that might indicate a more serious health problem. If you develop any of the following symptoms, it’s important to contact your healthcare provider sooner rather than later:</p><ul><li>Feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or weak</li><li>Difficulty performing everyday activities you normally do easily, such as cooking dinner or taking out the trash</li><li>Persistent coughing that doesn’t go away</li><li>Wheezing when you breathe in or out</li><li>Worsening wheezing even after taking your quick-relief medication and waiting for it to work (usually within 15 minutes)</li></ul><p>However, some symptoms warrant immediate support. Go to the emergency room or call 911 as soon as possible if you have the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>Bluish-colored lips or nails </li><li>Flaring nostrils when you breathe </li><li>Stretched skin between your ribs or on your throat when you breathe in</li><li>Rapid breathing </li><li>Difficulty walking or speaking at a normal pace</li></ul><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Living with asthma can sometimes limit the physical activity you can do. However, regular exercise can improve lung function, reduce inflammation, and increase stamina. Certain precautions, such as talking to your healthcare provider before starting an exercise routine, having your inhaler with you at all times, and monitoring symptoms during physical activity can help you work out safely.</p><p>Listen to your body while exercising and enjoy the benefits of exercise on your overall health.</p>
