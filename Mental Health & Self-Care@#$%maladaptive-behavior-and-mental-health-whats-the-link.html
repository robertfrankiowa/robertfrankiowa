    <main><h1>Maladaptive Behavior and Mental Health: What’s the Link?</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Elle Markman, PsyD, MPH</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Elle Markman, PsyD, MPH</strong><p>Maladaptive behaviors are unhealthy or ineffective ways of coping with something difficult or stressful. While they can be effective in helping you avoid distress in the short term, over time, maladaptive behaviors can negatively shape your social interactions, success in school or work, and ability to function in a healthy, appropriate way within society.</p><p>Maladaptive behaviors are highly individual. Many people use them to achieve a specific goal (e.g., improving mood) and tailor their behaviors to support that goal. Over time, they can become habitual.</p><p>This article will provide examples of maladaptive behaviors, outline the risks and theories about possible causes, and offer suggestions about managing maladaptive behaviors in yourself and others.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1ob1Wh_woman_sitting_on_a_sofa_looking_distressed_with_her_hand_on_her_head.jpg" alt="Woman sitting on a sofa, looking distressed with her hand on her head."><figcaption><em>amenic181 / Getty Images.

Some behaviors seem harmless (e.g., nail biting), while others are severe and can be unhealthy, aggressive, destructive, or disruptive. Maladaptive behaviors form throughout life for a myriad of reasons (e.g., anxiety, trauma, adverse childhood experiences). They can manifest into challenges including, but not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li>Being unable to hold close relationships</li><li>Experiencing harmful thought patterns, like negative self-talk</li><li>Having cognitive challenges, like attention deficit</li><li>Having difficulty adjusting to school, work, or social situations</li><li>Having poor communication skills</li><li>Having poor social skills, like lacking empathy or compassion</li><li>Struggling with academics</li></ul><p><h3>Maladaptive Behaviors and Personality Traits</h3><p>A childhood filled with chronic stress or trauma can impact your personality. There is a connection between people who have had significant emotional dysregulation in adolescence and maladaptive behaviors and personality disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder) later in life.</p><p> <p>However, maladaptive behaviors are not only a result of childhood stress or trauma. They form out of a psychological need or desire to avoid difficulties or cope with stress. Examples of these maladaptive behaviors include:</p><ul><li>Binge or unhealthy eating</li><li>Overwork</li><li>Self-harming behaviors like cutting</li><li>Social avoidance</li><li>Substance use</li></ul><p>This list is a small sample of the limitless maladaptive behaviors people may engage in.</p><h2>Examples of Maladaptive Behaviors</h2><p>There are endless maladaptive behaviors—and reasons—that someone may rely on to cope with difficulties or stress.</p><h3>Anger</h3><p>Everyone experiences anger. Anger is one of our core emotions and helps make us aware of possible injustice or mistreatment. Experiencing and expressing anger in and of itself is not a maladaptive behavior.</p><p>However, harboring or constantly experiencing anger can become emotionally, psychologically, and physically unhealthy over time. Holding on to anger for long periods or using it to act in unkind, unfair, or aggressive ways toward others is considered a maladaptive manifestation of anger.</p><p><h3>Anger vs. Aggression</h3><p>Anger is different from aggression, which is acting in harmful ways toward others. Though anger can cause aggression, they are not the same. A person can experience anger and not direct it toward anyone in a harmful or aggressive way, such as through withdrawal or passive aggressiveness. However, when a person acts aggressively toward others, it is often the result of maladaptive anger.</p><p> <h3>Daydreaming</h3><p>Daydreaming is a common way to get lost in thought or find distraction, and most people spend at least some time each day daydreaming. However, daydreaming can become maladaptive when it takes up most of your time to the extent that it becomes intense or disruptive.</p><p>Maladaptive daydreaming causes you to get so caught up in your daydreams that you may speak out loud, give voices to the characters in the daydream, and act out different roles for those characters.</p><p>Maladaptive daydreams are often used to escape stress or trauma. Those who engage in this kind of daydreaming tend to daydream for hours at a time, might have difficulty sleeping, and will often find it challenging to focus on daily tasks due to the desire to continue daydreaming.</p><h3>Passive-Agression</h3><p>Passive-aggressive behavior is considered an ineffective and non-normative way of communicating. It tends to occur when a person experiences feelings of anger, frustration, or irritation but does not choose or want to engage in an aggressive response. Instead, the response usually comes across as indirectly hostile. Passive aggression is maladaptive, as it is not a clear, direct, or consistent way of communicating with others and can lead to misunderstandings or feelings of being indirectly attacked.</p><p>Examples of passive-aggressiveness include telling on someone to a higher authority because you don't like them rather than talking with the person directly, avoiding eye contact with someone you don't like, intentionally ignoring people you don't like or giving them the silent treatment, and deliberately trying to sabotage someone.</p><h3>Safety Behaviors</h3><p>Safety behaviors are actions we take to avoid a threat, such as seeking shelter during a thunderstorm. These behaviors are meant to keep us safe when danger is present for the duration of the threat or risk. For people with anxiety, safety behaviors can result from the belief that a threat exists even when it doesn't or can continue long after the threat is gone.</p><p>These are considered maladaptive safety behaviors because they provide a continuous feedback loop that a non-threatening situation—like being in a social situation—is actually dangerous and, therefore, prevents you from experiencing alternatives to that fear-based conclusion. Maladaptive safety behaviors are typically present in people with high levels of anxiety.</p><h3>Self-Harm</h3><p>Self-harming behaviors are those that intentionally cause bodily injury, such as cutting, burning, and intentional poisoning. Those who self-harm often use it to release emotional pain or avoid psychological distress rather than cause death. All forms of self-harm are maladaptive, as they are an unsafe way of trying to cope with pain and distress.</p><p><h3>Who Self-Harms?</h3><p>Self-harm is most often seen in adolescents, with those in ninth grade being at the highest risk. Further, adolescent girls are three times more likely to self-harm than adolescent boys.</p><p> <h3>Sexual Maladaptive Behavior</h3><p>There are many forms of unhealthy and unsafe compulsive behaviors that serve as a way to distract from psychological distress, including sexual behaviors. Sexual maladaptive behavior occurs when you continuously engage in sexual thoughts, urges, and behaviors. There are two categories of sexual maladaptive behavior:</p><ul><li><strong>Paraphilic</strong> sexual behaviors are socially unacceptable behaviors that involve non-human objects and non-consenting partners (e.g., fetishism and pedophilia).</li><li><strong>Nonparaphilic</strong> sexual behaviors usually involve more typical sexual behaviors and desires (e.g., having multiple partners, fixation on another person, and compulsive use of pornography).</li></ul><h3>Substance Use</h3><p>Substance use disorders often form from a maladaptive coping mechanism whereby a person uses alcohol, drugs, or other illegal substances repetitively to cope with psychological distress. Often, those who use substances as a way of coping do so to avoid negative thoughts or difficult feelings. For many, these negative thoughts and experiences begin in childhood and continue into adulthood. Substances serve as a way to suppress guilt, anger, anxiety, depression, and embarrassment, among other feelings.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p>Social interaction is critical to our mental health. Though the degree to which a person wants to engage socially with others varies from person to person, some level of social engagement is necessary for everyone. Those who withdraw from others are likely to experience negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.</p><p>With social withdrawal, a person avoids approaching and interacting with others. It is a maladaptive way of coping with stress brought on by social engagements, fear related to illness or germs, or environmental challenges. Some research shows that social withdrawal has a genetic component.</p><p><h3>Social Isolation and Mortality</h3><p>People who are isolated from others have higher rates of mental illness and don't live as long as those who are not socially isolated. Those who are socially isolated have a higher risk of mortality than people who smoke, use alcohol, or have a high body mass index (BMI).</p><p> <h2>Risks of Maladaptive Behaviors</h2><p>Many people engage in maladaptive behaviors to help them feel better. These behaviors may serve them in the short term, but over time, they can harm a person's well-being. For example, someone may lie to gain sympathy or connection or to get immediate relief from a stressful situation. However, the lies may lead to social isolation, or procrastinating to avoid stress may interfere with their educational success. These behaviors can also harm others.</p><h3>Who Has a Higher Risk?</h3><p>People who experience neglect as children are at a higher risk for developing maladaptive behaviors. Neglect means that a child is not provided with the basic things needed to ensure their safety, health, and well-being, like food, shelter, and medical care. Those who have negative or harmful childhood experiences often struggle to cope in healthy ways with stress, trauma, and anxiety and develop maladaptive behaviors to cope with symptoms.</p><p>The more severe the exposure to adversity, the more straightforward and long-term the maladaptive response tends to be. For example, a person who experiences severe trauma might develop dissociative behaviors to help them cope that continue throughout their lifetime.</p><p>People at higher risk of maladaptive behaviors include those who:</p><ul><li>Experience ongoing or chronic stress</li><li>Have anxiety</li><li>Have experienced trauma</li><li>Have autism spectrum disorder</li></ul><p><h3>Maladaptive Behaviors and Autism</h3><p>Up to 97% of children with autism have difficulty regulating their emotions and behaviors when they experience sensory overload (e.g., loud noises or bright lights). Some of these reactive behaviors can be challenging, harmful, and considered maladaptive. Specialized support for those with an autism diagnosis can help children learn emotional regulation and control.</p><p> <h3>Theories About Causes</h3><p>There are many theories about what causes maladaptive behaviors. These include:</p><ul><li>A lack of motivation and difficulty with social interactions in children</li><li>Anxiety causing cognitive dysfunction</li><li>Children between 12 and 18 not receiving enough or the right kind of discipline</li><li>Children having constant access to mass media</li><li>Children not engaging in enough socialization</li><li>Children who grow up in a home where they are neglected or unloved by their parents or where there is favoritism shown to one child over the others</li><li>Influence from peer groups</li><li>Negative attitudes and behaviors toward children in school</li></ul><h2>How to Address Maladaptive Behavior Yourself</h2><p>Working through maladaptive behaviors can be difficult, as habits are typically challenging to break. To develop healthy coping methods, you must first understand which behaviors are considered maladaptive and how they negatively affect your life. Making changes can be particularly difficult when the maladaptive behavior is socially accepted or expected, such as going to work while sick or not taking vacation or break time.</p><p>Here are some things to consider as you address maladaptive behaviors yourself:</p><ul><li>Determine which behavior(s) you want to address. Think about the behaviors that seem to serve you well in the short term but may have long-term negative impacts.</li><li>Set goals for changing these behaviors by first writing down what you want things to look like six months from now. For example, you might write, "I have a good work/life balance."</li><li>Then, write down smaller, actionable steps that replace your maladaptive behaviors and help you achieve your larger goal. For example, you might write, "Stop working by 5 pm at least three days per week." Or, "Replace answering work emails before bed with reading a book two days per week."</li><li>Consider sharing your goals with someone you trust and ask them to help hold you accountable.</li><li>Give yourself grace and self-compassion on days you don't meet your goals.</li><li>Plan how you will celebrate your wins ahead of time to give you something to look forward to. Be sure your celebrations aren't maladaptive behaviors themselves.</li></ul><h2>Professional Support for Maladaptive Behavior</h2><p>Professional support from a mental health provider can help you replace maladaptive behaviors with healthier, more effective ones and begin to treat the underlying cause of those behaviors. Therapeutic interventions effective in treating people who have developed maladaptive behaviors include:</p><ul><li>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</li><li>Mode deactivation therapy (MDT)</li><li>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</li><li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</li></ul><p>Each of these interventions takes a different approach, but they can help you recognize and understand maladaptive behaviors and work to adjust or overcome them.</p><h2>Concern About Maladaptive Behavior in Someone Else</h2><p>It can be distressing to observe someone you care about engaging in maladaptive behavior. Though others may recognize an action as harmful, the person engaging in the behavior is likely gaining some benefit from it, even if it's only temporary relief. It can be difficult to help someone break their maladaptive behavior.</p><p><p>Some people become so comforted by the habit of their maladaptive behavior that they choose to continue it even with the knowledge of its potential long-term unhealthy impact. For example, someone might eat a donut every morning as a comforting habit while still knowing the long-term health risks.</p><p>If you are worried about someone's behavior, try to express your concern in a caring, non-judgmental way. Let them know you are worried about the long-term impact on their health and well-being and that you'd like to talk to them about your concerns if they are open to the conversation. When connecting with someone about your concerns, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Approach the person when you and they are both feeling calm and comfortable.</li><li>Use "I" statements to express what you've observed without judgment.</li><li>Try to listen more than you talk, and avoid arguing with the person about their behaviors.</li><li>Ask how you can help, and offer support if they are willing to seek treatment.</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Maladaptive behaviors are things we do that bring short-term satisfaction or relief but can cause long-term harm. People develop maladaptive behaviors after adverse childhood experiences that cause them to find ways of coping with their distress or because they are trying to deal with difficult emotions like stress or anxiety. You can work through some maladaptive behaviors on your own by setting clear goals and determining the path to reach them, or you can connect with a mental health provider who can help you identify and change unhealthy behaviors.</p>
