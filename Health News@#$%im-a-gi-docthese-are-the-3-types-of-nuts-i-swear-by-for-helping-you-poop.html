And one of the best ways to do that is to ensure you’re consuming enough fiber (and drinking plenty of water to go with it). Nuts are a fiber-rich food to add to your diet—they’re also packed with protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals. </p><p>“Fiber aids in the elimination of waste, promotes regularity and also feeds the good bacteria in your gut, the gut microbiome,” says <strong>Julia Zumpano, RD, </strong>a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. </p><p>Fiber bulks and softens your stool, making it easier to poop and helping to prevent constipation, according to the Mayo Clinic. Zumpano says fiber can also help control blood sugar and reduce cholesterol. </p><p>Another important aspect of fiber is that it can lower your risk for colon cancer because it keeps your digestive system healthy, says <strong>Dr. Pratima Dibba, MD,</strong> a gastroenterologist at Medical Offices of Manhattan. </p><p>But most people don’t consume as much fiber as they should, which is 25 grams a day for women and 38 grams for men, Dr. Dibba says. “That can be hard to do with a traditional Western diet.” </p><p>Nuts can be a great source of fiber, along with fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes. But, which nuts should you consume if you need help pooping, and how much should you eat? Health experts explain. </p><h2>The 3 Best Nuts for Digestion</h2><p>When eating nuts, variety is best, Zumpano says. Each type provides a unique set of nutrients. But she and Dr. Dibba recommend three types in particular: almonds, walnuts and pistachios. “They are the highest in fiber and lowest in saturated fat,” Zumpano says, noting that they offer many other health benefits too.</p><h3>Almonds</h3><p>Almonds have fewer carbohydrates and calories than other kinds of nuts. An ounce of almonds contains 3.5 grams of fiber—which can give your gut health a boost—along with 164 calories and 6 grams of carbs. </p><p>Almonds contain calcium, which benefits bone health, as well as vitamin E, which helps reduce inflammation in the body. They’re also a good source of healthy fats. </p><h3>Walnuts</h3><p>Walnuts are considered a superfood. They contain antioxidants and omega-3s, one of the healthiest types of fat, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Walnuts have been shown to help lower cholesterol, prevent heart disease and fight inflammation, which is often linked to a number of chronic health conditions. The nuts also benefit brain health and help lower your risk for cancer. </p><p>A one-ounce serving of walnuts contains 2 grams of fiber and 185 calories. Research shows that people have healthier gut bacteria when they eat walnuts. Walnuts also contain protein, iron and magnesium. </p><p>One ounce of pistachios contains 3 grams of fiber and 159 calories. Their high fiber content can improve your gut health and help you poop. The nuts contain heart-healthy fats, which can lower cholesterol. </p><p>Pistachios also have vitamin E, polyphenols and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which can benefit eye health, as well as vitamin B6, which can improve blood flow and promote the health of your nervous and immune systems.</p><h2>How Many Nuts Should You Eat?</h2><p>Nuts are generally calorie- and fat-dense, Zumpano says. “They’re also nutrient-dense, which is why we don’t suggest avoiding nuts.” </p><p>However, you don’t want to eat too many. She suggests limiting your intake of nuts to an ounce or two a day, which is about a quarter-cup of nuts or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Try not to consume more than 2 to 3 ounces a day. </p><p>Dr. Dibba says eating too many nuts could add extra fat and calories to your diet, which might cause weight gain or increased cholesterol. </p><p>But everyone’s individual calorie, fat and fiber needs are different. Zumpano says some people can tolerate eating nuts better than others, and they can be difficult to digest for some.</p><p>It’s also possible to develop a nut allergy later in life. If you notice abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, nasal congestion, difficulty swallowing or shortness of breath, it could be a sign of a nut allergy, and you should see an allergist. </p><h2>How to Incorporate More Nuts Into Your Diet</h2><p>To get the most health benefits from nuts, Dr. Dibba suggests incorporating them into an overall healthy diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fat. </p><p>Zumpano recommends snacking on nuts instead of chips or other snack foods or adding them to salads in place of cheese. Nuts can also add crunch to a stir fry or rice dish or as a topping for yogurt, chia seed pudding or oatmeal. </p><p>If you prefer nut butter, choose a natural option and smear it on whole grain toast in place of butter, she adds.</p><p>Next, read about the most important things poop reveals about your health. </p></main>
