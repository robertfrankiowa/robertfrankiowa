Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Adding more plants to your diet is a delicious and nutritious no-brainer. One scientific review shows these foods offer anti-inflammatory benefits as well as a hearty boost of gut-friendly fiber, while an article published in the <em>American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine</em> highlights other benefits of a diet rich in whole plant foods — with weight loss being one of them.</p><p>Whether you’ve decided to dive into a fully plant-based lifestyle or take a more Mediterranean-inspired approach by cutting back on animal products, the fundamental principle remains the same: Eat more plants. And when it comes to breakfast, these recipes featuring tasty, wholesome ingredients will give your morning a plant-centric start.</p><h2>1. Skillet Pears With Oats and Hazelnuts</h2><p>This recipe, initially created as a healthy dessert, also doubles as a tasty breakfast option that supports weight loss. A randomized control trial published in <em>Food & Function</em> found that eating one pear every day may help middle-age adults with metabolic syndrome decrease their waist size and waist-to-hip ratio. Additionally, since pears are so rich in dietary fiber, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), they are an ideal fruit for appetite control. To increase the protein of this recipe, pair it with a glass of unsweetened soy milk or add one to two tablespoons of almond butter on top.</p><h3>Skillet Pears With Oats and Hazelnuts</h3><p>2</p><p>serves</p><p>218 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>Fiber-rich pears contribute to appetite control, while hazelnuts add a bit of tasty crunch.</p><h2>2. Blueberry Ginger Green Smoothie</h2><p>It may feel unrealistic to eat a salad for breakfast, so turn to a smoothie containing leafy greens instead. Leafy greens like spinach are naturally low in calories, free of unhealthy fats, and contain no refined sugar. Plus, spinach is rich in vitamins A, C, E, and K, per the USDA. When you blend it into a smoothie, it may change the color, but you’ll hardly notice the veggie taste. At only 119 calories per serving, this low-calorie recipe also offers a nourishing blend of antioxidant-packed blueberries and digestion-friendly ginger. To ensure it’s a filling, satisfying meal, add the protein powder. </p><h3>Blueberry Ginger Green Smoothie</h3><p>2</p><p>serves</p><p>119 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>This blueberry ginger smoothie is just slightly sweet and has a subtle kick of heat from the ginger. </p><h2>3. Shakshuka</h2><p>Shakshuka is a fresh tomato-based dish that’s great for breakfast — or any time of day. While it’s traditionally made with eggs and feta, you can easily customize this recipe to suit your plant-based preferences. Simply swap dairy for the salty tang of kalamata olives and replace eggs with protein-rich chickpeas, cannellini beans, or soft tofu. Plus, according to a study in <em>Foods</em>, the high water content of the tomatoes will give your body a healthy hydration boost with every bite.</p><h3>Shakshuka</h3><p>6</p><p>serves</p><p>157 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>Topped with poached eggs and feta, this meal is sweet, savory, spicy, and salty. </p><h2>4. Spiced Apple Baked Oatmeal</h2><p>Even if you’re not usually an oatmeal fan, this oatmeal bake takes on a whole new texture and flavor that’s worth exploring. Mix your ingredients in a bowl, but instead of cooking the mixture on the stovetop, pop it in the oven until it’s golden and firm. The convenience factor is a major bonus, not to mention the health benefits from the oats. Research published in <em>Current Nutrition Reports</em> reveals that oats can aid in managing body weight, controlling appetite, boosting the immune system, reducing cholesterol levels, and promoting a healthier gut microbiome. For an extra boost of plant-based protein, consider adding hemp, flax, or chia seeds.</p><h3>Spiced Apple Baked Oatmeal</h3><p>6</p><p>serves</p><p>256 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>This spiced apple baked oatmeal is the ultimate cozy breakfast that’s simple to make and perfect for meal prep.</p><h2>5. Protein-Packed Beans on Toast</h2><p>Beans for breakfast? You bet! Think of it like hummus, except instead of chickpeas, you’re using fava beans. With the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommending 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories, this recipe, offering nearly 13 grams, sets you on the right track to meeting this target from the get-go. Omit the cheese if you’re dairy-free, and top it with chives and parsley instead.</p><h3>Protein-Packed Beans on Toast</h3><p>1</p><p>serves</p><p>342 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>Beans on toast may not be an intuitive pairing, but believe it or not, this simple dish is a traditional breakfast in the United Kingdom!</p><p>Author</p><h2>6. Pink Grapefruit Smoothie</h2><p>If you love tart flavors, this high-protein smoothie will be a nice welcome to your breakfast routine. If you’re dairy-free, consider using a plant-based protein powder in place of the Greek yogurt. As is, you’ll adore the filling benefits that this smoothie's 19 grams of protein have to offer. Plus, chia seeds, a standout ingredient, provide alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid crucial for heart health, brain function, and combating inflammation — a must-have in any plant-based diet.</p><h3>Pink Grapefruit Smoothie</h3><p>2</p><p>serves</p><p>253 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>If you love tart drinks, you’ll adore the taste of this smoothie, which gets just enough natural sweetness from bananas to balance grapefruit’s bold flavor without added sugars. </p><p>Author</p><p>Reviewed by</p><h2>7. Crunchy Banana Sunflower Toast</h2><p>Seeds are recommended in a plant-based diet, and as a spread, it’s easier to eat and portion out. Sunflower seed butter has a slightly earthier taste compared to traditional nut butters, and while it’s usually marketed to those with nut allergies or sensitivities, more people should try it. Be sure to check the ingredients, as some include added sugar, and the American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 6 percent of calories each day.</p><h3>Crunchy Banana Sunflower Toast</h3><p>serves</p><p>313 Cal</p><p>Per serving</p><p>If you’d like to add more magnesium to your diet, sunflower seeds can help. </p><p>Author</p><p>Reviewed by</p><h2>8.

With oats, almond butter, and berries in the mix, this recipe delivers 12 grams of dietary fiber and 15 grams of protein — two essentials for feeling satisfied.
