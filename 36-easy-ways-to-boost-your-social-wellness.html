    <main><h1>36 Easy Ways to Boost Your Social Wellness</h1><h2>What is Social Health and Wellness?</h2><p>In general, social health and wellness includes a set of behaviors and lifestyle habits that promote strong relationships with peers, family, and even strangers.</p><p>Here's 36 ways you can boost your social wellness, easily. </p><h2>Join a Club</h2><p>Consider joining a club or sports team just for fun. Choose something you can do on a weekday evening that will get you out of the house and meeting new people. Social connections help protect health and lengthen life.</p><h2>Have Lunch With Someone New</h2><p>Break your usual routine, and meet with a new friend for lunch on a sunny afternoon. The different setting and new friend will add some excitement to your social life, and do wonders for your emotional health.</p><h2>Explore a New Place</h2><p>Take a few minutes and check out that thrift shop in town you’ve been eyeing up for months. Squeeze in some time before your weekly grocery shop, or on a Sunday afternoon. Spark a conversation with the owner about a cool new find.</p><figure><img title="Explore a New Place" src="IMG/BB1kCSIl_explore_a_new_place.jpg" alt="Explore a New Place"><figcaption><em>Explore a New Place.

Being there for someone else’s time of need is good for your own health as well.</p><h2>Socialize Off-Line</h2><p>Get off social media and spark up a conversation with someone face-to-face. Talk to your neighbour about their new car, or chat with someone at the mailbox. Even a 5-minute conversation will boost your social wellness.</p><h2>Look for Similarities in Others Rather Than Differences</h2><p>This helps build connections. Most of us have the same needs and wants, and we usually have far more similarities with others than we think.</p><h2>Make it a Regular Thing</h2><p>Schedule a regular date to do something helps you stay consistently connected. Every Sunday, watch your favorite show with a friend, every Wednesday you can go for a run together.</p><h2>Embrace Diversity</h2><p>Be aware of your biases. If everyone were the same, the world would be a very boring place.</p><h2>Engage in Healthy Romantic Relationships</h2><p>Strong, healthy relationships can also help to strengthen your immune system, help you recover from disease, and may even lengthen your life.</p><h2>Learn How to Apologize</h2><p>Apologizing builds bridges and heals wounds. It is also a courageous act—since it can be difficult to do—because you’re overcoming your own self-protectiveness when you do it.</p><h2>Learn the Power of Forgiveness</h2><p>As with apologizing, giving forgiveness is also important for social well-being. When someone hurts you, it’s hard to forget, but holding onto anger only continues to hurt yourself.</p><h2>Practice Gratitude</h2><p>Be thankful for what you have and what you can do. Surely, there’s a lot more you’d like in life, but if you only focus on what you’re missing, you’ll miss out on the great things right in front of you.</p><figure><img title="Practice Gratitude" src="IMG/BB1kCX7n_practice_gratitude.jpg" alt="Practice Gratitude"><figcaption><em>Practice Gratitude. fauxels , Pexels</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Take a Holiday</h2><p>Take a break every now and then and get away. It doesn’t have to be an expensive overseas trip or an extended time off work.</p><p>Go away for the weekend, or check into a local hotel overnight just get away from your everyday life and reset.</p><h2>Laugh Often</h2><p>Laughter is great for your physical and emotional wellbeing. It relieves stress; releases endorphins and can help shift your focus from the distressing to a more positive perspective.</p><h2>Get Outdoors</h2><p>Sunlight improves your mood and being outside encourages you to be more active and it supplies you with vitamin D which helps your body absorb calcium.</p><h2>Adopt a Pet</h2><p>Pets are another great way to relieve stress. Cuddles with your pet can be really beneficial for both of you.</p><h2>Volunteer Your Time</h2><p>Giving back to others is a great way to get your focus off yourself and onto others. It helps develop your sense of gratitude and empathy.</p><h2>Get Some Plants</h2><p>Plants aren’t just aesthetically pleasing; they serve a purpose too. Plants remove toxins from the air, and add oxygen, improving the overall air quality of your home—which does wonders for your health.</p><h2>Take Up Gardening</h2><p>Digging in the dirt relieves stress, boosts your memory, boosts your mood, and even burns calories. Find a community garden to join and make it a social booster too.</p><h2>Join a Fitness Class</h2><p>Not only does exercise boost your health all on its own, but joining a group class makes it a social event that doubles up on the benefits.</p><figure><img title="Join a Fitness Class" src="IMG/BB1kCLNJ_join_a_fitness_class.jpg" alt="Join a Fitness Class"><figcaption><em>Join a Fitness Class. Victor Freitas, Pexels</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Give Compliments</h2><p>Making other people feel good about themselves is a great way to start any kind of relationship and build connections—and it will also make you feel good too.</p><h2>Mindful Eating</h2><p>Be mindful how you’re fueling your body, but don’t forget to treat yourself. Enjoy dinner with friends once in a while without paying too much attention to the ingredients.</p><h2>Plan Outings with Friends</h2><p>Our busy adult lives often prevent us from seeing our friends regularly, but don’t let that become the new norm. Prioritize time with your friends, doing what you love to do together.</p><h2>Master the Art of Conflict Resolution</h2><p>There’s no need for conflicts to become unpleasant or hostile. Learn how to phrase requests so they don’t appear to be an attack. This will strengthen social relationships.</p><h2>Drink More Coffee</h2><p>Coffee has a range of positive effects on both your physical and mental fitness. Grabbing a cup of coffee and having a chat with a friend is also a great way to relax.</p><h2>Eat More Chocolate</h2><p>Chocolate is a mood lifter and good quality chocolate also has some health benefits when consumed in moderation. It’s also a great treat to share among friends.</p><h2>Take Alone Time</h2><p>Having a social life can be emotional draining all in itself. Make sure you take time for yourself so you don’t get too overwhelmed being social all the time.</p><h2>Prioritize Sleep</h2><p>A proper amount of sleep is necessary to keep you performing well, as well as to maintain mental and emotional health.</p><h2>Prioritize Relaxation</h2><p>Take a yoga or meditation class. Not only does this boost your relaxation, it also gets you being social with like-minded people.</p><h2>Read More Books</h2><p>Join a book club. Not only does reading benefit your social and emotional well-being, but joining a book club gives you the opportunity to discuss interest topics with others.</p><h2>Take Up a Hobby</h2><p>Find other people who share the same interests as you. Join a local craft group, or attend a paint night in your area.</p><h2>Don’t Be a Flake</h2><p>Be mindful of the commitments you make and keep them. Know your limitations and don’t spread yourself too thin.</p><figure><img title="Don’t Be a Flake" src="IMG/BB1kCQ2M_dont_be_a_flake.jpg" alt="Don’t Be a Flake"><figcaption><em>Don’t Be a Flake. Andrea Piacquadio, Pexels</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Practice Self Care</h2><p>Finding balance in life is increasingly important. Self-care embraces basic needs and avoids negative coping mechanisms.</p><h2>Don’t Criticize Others</h2><p>No one wants to be judged, criticized or blamed, and if those dynamics are present, it can indicate an unhealthy, and potentially abusive, relationship.</p><h2>Find Healthy Coping Mechanisms</h2><p>Stress is inevitable, but how you react to it is up to you. Having healthy coping mechanisms will help keep your mood in check, and avoiding straining connections with others.</p><h2>Set and Keep Boundaries</h2><p>Setting healthy boundaries—on both our personal and professional lives—allows us to express who we are as opposed to who people expect us to be.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Practicing social wellness doesn’t need to be difficult. It’s as simple as making a list of habits you’d like to integrate into your life.</p><p>These practices can have lasting benefits on your physical and mental well-being.</p></main>
