It all starts with making your brain stronger.</p><p>Women, on average, live six years longer than men--yet, for most, the last decade of life can be plagued with cascading poor health.</p><p>While heart disease is the number one killer of women, studies from Age Wave, a leading think tank focused on aging, longevity, and retirement, report women's biggest health fear is getting Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p><p>As it turns out, women are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's disease and suffer from cognitive decline. What if there was a way for women to better match their brainspans to their lifespans, improving their productivity, sense of purpose, and quality of life?</p><p>In <em>Ageless Aging: A Woman's Guide to Increasing Healthspan, Brainspan, and Lifespan</em>, Maddy Dychtwald provides a holistic and practical guide based on cutting-edge research to help women of all ages take advantage of the scientific, psychological, and physical knowledge and tools to feel more vital, productive, purposeful, and youthful well into their 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond.</p><p>I spoke with Dychtwald, who has devoted an entire chapter to brain health, to get her best tips on how women at any age can feel more purposeful and increase their brainspan to better match their lifespans. This is an important key to expanding the number of years you can successfully work and enjoy life. While she emphasized that there are even more practical steps you can take, here are her top five.</p><h2>1. Stimulate your brain by learning new things.</h2><p>The brain is like any other muscle in your body--if you want it to stay vital, you need to strengthen it. It's a known fact that education can build cognitive reserve, increasing brain capacity and resilience, which makes you less vulnerable to dementia. Dychtwald told me, "Learning something new, such as a foreign language, how to use the latest software or app, or even how to prepare a new recipe, stimulates your brain and fosters neuroplasticity. Unfortunately, crosswords, Sudoku, and Wordle aren't the answer. You'll get really good at those games, but that won't improve your cognition.</p><h2>2. Eat the rainbow.</h2><p>The same components that give plants their color are also antioxidants that can counteract inflammation, which is an overactive immune response that can degrade healthy tissues everywhere, including in your brain. By eating more colorful whole foods, you'll be protecting your brain health. "That doesn't mean grabbing a handful of colorful Fruit Loops, an ultra-processed food, while sitting at your desk," says Dychtwald. (Ultra-processed foods have been associated with an accelerated decline in cognitive functioning.) "Instead," she adds, "it means eating colorful fruits and vegetables such as berries, leafy greens, whole grains, and even dark chocolate. It also means getting plenty of omega-3 fatty acids by eating fatty fish such as salmon."</p><h2>3. Reframe your perspectives on aging.</h2><p>The pioneering research of Yale gerontologist Becca Levy has found that the way you think about getting older has a profound influence on your lifespan and even your brainspan. Zeroing in on brainspan, one of her studies found that thinking positively about growing older significantly reduced the risk of developing dementia--even among those with a higher genetic risk</p><p>Start by seeking out examples of female founders and business owners you admire, and who are older than you and remain purposeful, productive, vital, and energetic at work and in life. Seek out friendships with colleagues who are older and younger than you are so that you can enrich each other's lives by sharing your unique perspectives.</p><h2>4. Exercise, exercise, exercise.</h2><p>According to Dychtwald, who interviewed close to one hundred experts for <em>Ageless Aging</em>, "nearly every expert I interviewed named exercise as the number one thing they do to protect their brainspan." There's a lot of science to point to the fact that exercise not only increases blood flow to the brain, but it also produces molecules known as exerkines, which boost the creation of new neurons and neuroplasticity. So get up from your desk and take a walk during lunchtime, have a walking meeting with a client or colleague outdoors, or even just walk around the office for a few laps while you're on a phone or Zoom call.</p><h2>5. Take a probiotic for improved gut health.</h2><p>The gut has been called the second brain and plays an important role in brain health. Among other things, the gut produces neurotransmitters and hormones that can impact brain health. Dychtwald suggests, "Take a probiotic and try eating fermented foods to strengthen the good bacteria in your gut." Another tip, according to Dychtwald, is to "cut down on sugar to deprive the bad bacteria in your gut of their favorite food source." Try bringing healthier snacks such as nuts or trail mix with you to work and even sharing them with your colleagues. You might influence your work team to do the same.</p><p>If women business owners and entrepreneurs want to stay smart, savvy, and productive at work (and in life!) while increasing their mental and emotional health and well-being, these tips can help them get started.</p></main>
