    <main><h1>12 Important Tips for Better Bladder Health</h1><h2>Avoid Constipation</h2><p>Constipation is an uncomfortable buildup of stool in the colon, which can in turn put pressure on the bladder. This may keep the bladder from expanding the way it should. Being physically active, drinking plenty of water, and eating plenty of high-fiber foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help you struggle with constipation far less.</p><figure><img title="Avoid Constipation" src="IMG/AA1jdPii_avoid_constipation.jpg" alt="Avoid Constipation"><figcaption><em>Avoid Constipation.

Daily exercises can strengthen these muscles, which can help keep urine from leaking when you cough, lift something, or sneeze. Pelvic floor exercises may also help avoid bladder infections by strengthening the muscles that help to empty the bladder.</p><h2>Do Not Hold It</h2><p>One of the best things you can do for bladder health is going when you have to go. According to NIA, holding urine in the bladder for too long can weaken bladder muscles and increase chances of contracting a bladder infection.</p><h2>Drink Plenty of Fluids</h2><p>According to NIA, more than half of the human body is made up of water, so it is important that you are drinking enough fluids. How much water you need on a daily basis will vary based on your activity level, size, and the local climate. In general, though, drink enough fluids so that you need to urinate every few hours. Ask your healthcare provider how much fluid is healthy for you.</p><figure><img title="Drink Plenty of Fluids" src="IMG/AA1jdJA3_drink_plenty_of_fluids.jpg" alt="Drink Plenty of Fluids"><figcaption><em>Drink Plenty of Fluids. d3sign - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Fully Empty the Bladder</h2><p>When using the bathroom, you may be in a rush to get in and get out as quickly as possible, but rushing when you urinate may not allow the bladder to fully empty. If urine remains in the bladder too long, a bladder infection may develop, so take your time when going to the bathroom even if it slows you down a tiny bit.</p><figure><img title="Fully Empty the Bladder" src="IMG/AA1jdPiC_fully_empty_the_bladder.jpg" alt="Fully Empty the Bladder"><figcaption><em>Fully Empty the Bladder. the_burtons - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Talk to Your Doctor About Your Medications</h2><p>Some medications may cause bladder leakage, so if this side effect bothers you, you can ask your physician if there is another medication you can take. Always consult with your doctor before starting or stopping any medications.</p><h2>Limit Coffee and Alcohol</h2><p>For some people, drinking alcoholic or caffeinated beverages can bother the bladder and increase symptoms such as frequent visits to the bathroom or the urgent need to urinate. Limiting these drinks is an easy way to care for your bladder a little more.</p><h2>Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2><p>According to NIA, people who are overweight may be at higher risk for leaking urine. That means being physically active, exercising regularly, and making mindful food choices can help with overall bladder health.</p><h2>Opt for Cotton Underwear</h2><p>Wearing cotton underwear can help keep the area around the urethra dry and free of any extra moisture. Fabrics, like nylon, do not breathe well while tight-fitting pants can trap moisture, which sometimes help grow bacteria.</p><h2>Quit Smoking</h2><p>Bladder problems are more common among smokers. Smoking can also increase the risk of bladder cancer, so take the steps to quit smoking to support better bladder health, and help your lungs while you're at it.</p><figure><img title="Quit Smoking" src="IMG/AA1jdRJf_quit_smoking.jpg" alt="Quit Smoking"><figcaption><em>Quit Smoking. volschenkh - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Relax at the Toilet</h2><p>When urinating, relaxing the muscles around the bladder makes it easier to empty the it entirely. This is an easy step to take to make sure you are making the best of your bathroom trip and improving bladder health.</p><h2>Urinate After Sex</h2><p>After some sexy time, use the restroom. Sexual activity can move bacteria from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. Both men and women should try to urinate shortly after sex to lower the risk of any infections.</p></main>
