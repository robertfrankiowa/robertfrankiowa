Below, we’ve outlined 10 potential health benefits of Ashwagandha, as indicated by peer-reviewed journals and medical associations. Importantly, every body is different and as such, each reaction can be different. Be sure to consult your doctor before use and be vigilant whenever working with new supplements.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Relieves Stress and Anxiety</h3><p>One of the most common uses for ashwagandha is to help reduce stress and anxiety in men (based on science, yo!) Ashwagandha is known as an “adaptogen,” which means it’s really good at helping your body handle stress. By keeping stress hormones like cortisol in check, it can help promote a sense of calm and peace – keeping you stress-free throughout the day. So, if you’re going through a particularly stressful or anxious period in life, Ashwagandha root may help you embrace your inner zen.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Lowers Blood Sugar and Fat</h3><p>Research suggests ashwagandha is pretty nifty at regulating blood sugar by making your cells more responsive to insulin. That means fewer blood sugar spikes. Plus, studies also show it may lend a helping hand in managing those stubborn fat levels. So, if you’re watching your waistline or your overall health, ayurvedic medicine may help!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Increases Muscle and Strength</h3><p>We know supplements like creatine can help you grow your muscles – but ashwagandha may be another solution. Studies suggest it’s a great supplement for helping to build muscle and boost strength, especially when you’re hitting the gym regularly. So, if you’re chasing those gains, Ashwagandha might just be the secret ingredient you’ve been missing.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Supports Heart Health</h3><p>Your heart deserves some love too, right? When we’re younger, we don’t often think about our heart health, but we should. After all, it’s the only one we’ve got. Ashwagandha may help promote better heart health in the long run. It’s known for potentially lowering cholesterol levels, especially the not-so-friendly LDL cholesterol. A happy heart is a healthy heart, and Ashwagandha may just be your heart’s best friend.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Helps Improve Depression</h3><p>Along with helping reduce stress and anxiety in men (and women), ashwagandha may also be a natural mood booster to help during periods when you’re feeling low. Some studies have found that ashwagandha can help improve symptoms of depression by playing with the levels of feel-good neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Of course, if you’re experiencing ongoing feelings of depression/sadness or anxiety, it’s always best to speak with a healthcare professional.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Helps Relieve Adrenal Fatigue</h3><p>Do you often find yourself feeling slow and lethargic? Ashwagandha’s adaptogenic powers make it an excellent choice for tackling adrenal/stress-related fatigue. It’s like a cup of coffee for your adrenal glands, helping you regain your energy by dealing with chronic and stress-related disorders in a balanced way.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Boost Fertility and Increase Testosterone Levels</h3><p>Looking to welcome a newborn in the near future? Well, ashwagandha may help you and your partner on your baby-making journey. Some studies suggest that ashwagandha can in fact be good for reproduction. It helps improve sperm quality in infertile men by balancing hormone levels. In one study, 14% of men’s partners got pregnant during the research.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Sharpens Focus, Memory & Cognitive Function</h3><p>Not only is ashwagandha good at reducing stress, but it’s also a great way to give your brain a natural boost. Around 600 mg of ashwagandha a day (300 mg of ashwagandha 2 x per day) is thought to be great for mental clarity. It can improve focus, memory, and other cognitive functions and brain function too. So, if you’ve got tasks that need your brain firing on all cylinders, Ashwagandha might be just what you need.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Boosts Immune Function</h3><p>Ashwagandha is great for your immune system. It fights stress, and inflammation, and tosses in some antioxidants to keep things in top shape. Withania somnifera ashwagandha contains immune-modulating peptides that help your body’s defences stay sharp. And don’t forget the bonus: it helps you catch some quality ZZZs, which your immune system loves.</p><p>If you want a natural workout boost, ashwagandha may be just the ticket. Increasing stamina and endurance is one of the well-known effects of ashwagandha. It fights off exercise-induced fatigue, giving you the stamina and endurance to push through those tougher workouts. So, if you’re aiming for longer, more effective sessions, consider a daily dose of ashwagandha.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Ashwagandha?</h2><p>In short, ashwagandha is an evergreen shrub that grows in Asia and Africa. Scientifically known as Withania Somnifera, it’s is also a powerful herb that has been a staple in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries.</p><p>It’s known for its incredible health benefits and adaptogenic properties (which basically means it helps the body adapt to stress and anxiety), its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to promote overall well-being.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Man of Many US" src="IMG/BB1j4P4z_mortar_and_pestle_beside_turmeric_fenugreek_boswellia_and_ashwagandha_on_a_wooden_spoon.jpg" alt="Mortar and pestle beside Turmeric, Fenugreek, Boswellia and Ashwagandha on a wooden spoon"><figcaption><em>What is Ayurvedic Medicine | Image: Formulate Health. Provided by Man of Many US</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is </strong>Ayurvedic Medicine?</h2><p>Ayurvedic Medicine is an ancient healing system that traces its roots back more than 3,000 years to India. It’s a holistic approach to health that seeks to bring harmony to your body, mind, and spirit.</p><p>The term “Ayurveda” means “the science of life” in Sanskrit, and that’s precisely what it’s all about. Rather than just treating symptoms, Ayurveda focuses on understanding your unique constitution and maintaining overall well-being.</p><p>In Ayurveda, you’re not a one-size-fits-all patient, unlike traditional medicine. It recognises that each person is different, and it considers your doshas, which are your individual body and mind types. The goal is to keep you in balance and in good health.</p><p>This ancient system uses a combination of natural remedies, herbal treatments, dietary guidance, yoga, and meditation to achieve its aims. So, while Ayurvedic Medicine has a long history, it’s still relevant today as a holistic and personalised approach to health and well-being.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Man of Many US" src="IMG/BB1j4P4B_hand_holding_ashwagandha_tablets_in_a_cupped_palm.jpg" alt="Hand holding Ashwagandha tablets in a cupped palm"><figcaption><em>How to Take Ashwagandha Supplements | Image: Towfiqu Barbhuiya.
