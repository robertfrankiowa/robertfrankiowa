Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>Popsicles are a quintessential summertime treat, and you may have tons of memories of eating them with siblings and friends as a child (and as an adult, let's be honest). Yet, these frozen goodies are available year-round, and maybe you frequent the frozen aisle even when the forecast calls for sub-zero temperatures. Hey, no shame in that. </p><p>"Popsicles...are delicious to eat and can be refreshing because their icy texture cools down our throats and provides excellent relief, especially during hot weather," says <strong>Lesley Kumar, RD, </strong>a nutrition consultant at Ringside24. "They are convenient to grab, eat and enjoy. These sugary sweets do not require much preparation."</p><p>Yet, is it cool to eat a popsicle every day for the summer—or even an entire year? What does a daily popsicle do to your health and body? Kumar says understanding the pros and cons of eating a specific food at least once daily is essential, as diet plays a critical role in overall health. Here, she and another registered dietitian explain what happens to the body when you eat a popsicle every day.</p><h2>9 Things That Happen When You Eat a Popsicle Every Single Day</h2><h3>1. You'll probably be more hydrated</h3><p>The idea that you need to drink eight, 8-ounce glasses of water per day has long been debunked—even the CDC notes that hydration needs vary based on activity level, climate and whether you're running a fever. But water isn't the only way to stay hydrated. People can also meet their needs for fluids through foods like fruits, veggies and, yes, popsicles.</p><p>"Popsicles are primarily water," Kumar says. "It is one of the most refreshing ways to stay hydrated, especially in hot weather. The icy texture quenches our thirst and provides immediate relief."</p><h3>2. Your mental health could improve</h3><p>Food doesn't just affect your physical health. It can also factor into your mental health, so if you love popsicles, you'll love this nugget: "Enjoying a popsicle, especially as a considered treat, can provide a psychological boost," Kumar says. "The enjoyment of a sweet treat can lead to the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals."</p><h3>3. You'll experience a short-term energy increase</h3><p>Feeling sluggish? A popsicle may provide a quick fix (literally). "Popsicles contain sugar, and chewing on popsicles daily gives you a quick energy boost," Kumar says. "The natural sugar in popsicles is a rapid source of energy for our bodies. So, when you need something to pick up your energy levels, popsicles do not let you down. They give you a quick lift."</p><p>Yet, the faster they rise...</p><h3>4. You might also notice long-term fatigue</h3><p>Unfortunately, the sugar-induced energy surge you get from a popsicle will probably be short-lived. "Eating a popsicle daily, especially those high in added sugars, can contribute to excessive sugar intake, potentially affecting blood sugar levels and leading to energy spikes and crashes," says <strong>Dr. Chris Mohr, RD, Ph.D.</strong>, a fitness and nutrition advisor at Fortune Recommends Health.</p><h3>5. You may experience weight gain</h3><p>Not all popsicles are created equal. However, Dr. Mohr notes that foods high in sugar, fat and calories can contribute to weight gain if eaten daily.</p><p>Research, including a 2023 narrative review in <em>Nutrients</em>, has found that eating too much sugar puts a person at a higher risk for developing obesity. The American Heart Association also warns of the weight-related dangers of consuming excess sugar. The AHA suggests limiting sugar consumption to 6% of your daily calories (100 calories or about six teaspoons for women and 150 calories or about nine teaspoons for men).</p><h3>6. Nutrient deficiencies could become a problem</h3><p>Balance is a critical piece to a healthy diet. Unfortunately, a popsicle-heavy daily diet will not help you achieve that worthy goal. "If popsicles are consistently chosen over more nutrient-dense options, it might lead to nutrient deficiencies over time if your diet lacks in diversity," Dr. Mohr says.</p><p>One study published in <em>Open Heart </em>found that too much added sugar could lead to nutrient deficiencies.</p><h3>7. GI problems might pop up</h3><p>Your tastebuds may thank you for a daily popsicle now. Your gut may not say the same later. "Nobody can deny that popsicles are tasty," Kumar says. "However, consuming too many daily can lead to an upset stomach...the sugar content in popsicles can lead to discomfort, bloating or cramps."</p><h3>8. You might get cavities</h3><p>The teeth that help you chew the popsicle? They may wind up with cavities down the road. "Sugar promotes bacterial growth, increasing the risk of tooth cavities," Kumar says. "So, frequently consuming popsicles is not advisable, especially when you do not follow proper oral hygiene care."</p><p>One 2016 <em>Advances in Nutrition</em> study found that people were less likely to have cavities if added sugar intake was less than 5% of their daily calorie intake,</p><p>A daily popsicle might not be the best idea if you're living with or at a higher risk for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes. </p><p>"Popsicles have a high sugar content that can affect blood levels. So, you must be careful of the diabetes factor," Kumar says. "Excessive sugar consumption can cause severe diabetes-related health complications."</p><p>Dr. Mohr adds: "Those with heart disease should also limit high-fat, high-calorie options that could contribute to cholesterol and other cardiovascular issues."</p><p>Research shows that too much sugar intake can raise the risk of inflammation, a common issue for people with these conditions (and others).</p><h2>Healthy Tips for Popsicle Lovers</h2><p>A daily popsicle isn't necessarily off the table. The ingredients list can clue you into options that are less likely to cause issues, like blood sugar spikes and crashes or long-term disease risk.</p><p>"Look for options lower added sugars," Dr. Mohr suggests. "Some popsicles may be sweetened with artificial sweeteners, which can be preferable for reducing calories but should be eaten in moderation."</p><p>Peep the serving size too. "Smaller popsicles or those portioned properly can help manage calorie intake while still giving you the satisfaction of a sweet treat," Dr. Mohr says.</p><p>Alternatively, you may be able to satisfy popsicle cravings with other treats — some of which may even have health benefits. Some of Kumar's favorite popsicle swaps include:</p><ul><li>Frozen fruit bars with pureed fruit</li><li>Yogurt pops that blend yogurt and fruit for a "creamy treat" (Dr. Mohr recommends using Greek yogurt for added protein)</li><li>Smoothie pops made with your favorite smoothie mixture and frozen</li></ul><p>While popsicles can be sweet, so is taking control of your health. "By making informed choices, we can optimize our health and prevent potential health issues," Kumar explains.</p></main>
