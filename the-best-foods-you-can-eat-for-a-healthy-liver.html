    <main><h1>The Best Foods You Can Eat For A Healthy Liver</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Jamie Johnson, RDN</strong><p>The liver is a large organ that comprises about 2% of the average adult’s body weight. Your liver is constantly working to keep you healthy by performing an array of vital functions, such as filtering harmful substances in your blood, breaking down toxins, and supporting metabolism, immune function, digestion, and more.</p><p>Following a nutritious diet rich in foods known to support and protect the liver can help prevent common liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and promote optimal liver function.</p><p>Here are 10 of the best foods for liver health, and other tips for preventing liver disease. </p><h2>1. Fruits and Vegetables </h2><p>Following a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, including berries, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables, is one of the best ways to care for your liver from the inside out. </p><p>Fruits and vegetables are concentrated in liver-protective nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds. Fiber-rich foods, like fruits and vegetables, help prevent and reduce fat accumulation in the liver by increasing satiety, which can help promote fat loss. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant substances found in fruits and vegetables, such as carotenoids and polyphenols, can help prevent inflammation-related liver injury.</p><p>Diets rich in fruits and vegetables, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating fatty NAFLD.</p><p>What’s more, diets high in vegetables may help reduce the risk of liver cancer. A 2019 review found that higher vegetable intake was associated with a 39% reduction in liver cancer risk and that every 100-gram (g) per day increase in vegetable intake was associated with a 4% reduced risk of liver cancer.</p><h2>2. Ginger</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1mHlDK_ginger_root_with_a_sliced_piece_of_ginger_on_a_wood_background.jpg" alt="Ginger root with a sliced piece of ginger on a wood background"><figcaption><em>Armastas / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ginger is a root derived from the <em>Zingiber officinale</em> plant. Its consumption is linked to a variety of benefits, including improved liver health. Ginger contains a number of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, such as gingerols and shogaols, that may benefit people with certain liver conditions, such as NAFLD. </p><p>These compounds may help prevent and improve liver diseases by reducing oxidative stress and the production of proinflammatory substances that may otherwise lead to cellular damage.</p><p>In a 2020 study that included 46 people with NAFLD, treatment with 1,500 milligrams (mg) of ginger powder per day for 12 weeks led to significant reductions in markers of inflammation and liver disease, including the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fetuin-A, and C-reactive protein (CRP), compared to placebo treatment.</p><p>Ginger powder and fresh ginger can be added to a number of sweet and savory dishes, making it a smart kitchen ingredient for those with liver conditions. </p><h2>3. Garlic </h2><p>Like ginger, garlic is packed with liver-supportive substances, including allicin, allinin, and ajoene, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the body.</p><p>Regularly consuming garlic may help improve liver health in people with liver disease and even reduce the risk of liver cancer.</p><p>A 2020 study that included 90 people with NAFLD showed that the group who were supplemented with 1,600 mg of garlic powder per day for 12 weeks had lower levels of the liver enzymes ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as well as significant reductions in liver fat compared to a placebo group.</p><p>Additionally, studies show that regularly eating raw garlic may lower the risk of liver diseases, such as NAFLD and liver cancer, in certain populations.</p><p>For example, in a 2019 study that included 9,944 Chinese adults, eating raw garlic two or more times per week was associated with a 23% reduced risk of liver cancer compared to consuming no raw garlic or eating raw garlic less than twice per week.</p><h2>4. Chia and Flax Seeds</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1mH7FT_chia_and_flax_seeds_in_wooden_spoons_and_bowls.jpg" alt="Chia and flax seeds in wooden spoons and bowls"><figcaption><em>Luis Echeverri Urrea / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chia seeds and flaxseeds are incredibly rich in fiber, which is important for people with liver disease. High-fiber foods can help protect against liver disease by reducing overall calorie consumption and supporting healthy body weight, as well as stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which can reduce inflammation and protect against liver injury.</p><p>In a 2020 study of 25 patients with NAFLD, it was found that an 8-week treatment of 25 g of ground chia seed per day led to NAFLD regression in 52% of the participants.</p><p>Flax seed consumption has also been shown to decrease markers of liver disease and liver fat accumulation in people with NAFLD and may help protect against liver cancer.</p><h2>5. Olive Oil</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1mHnXt_olive_oil_being_poured_into_a_small_glass_bowl_on_a_wooden_table_a_glass_bowl_full_of_green_olives_sits_b.jpg" alt="Olive oil being poured into a small glass bowl on a wooden table.. A glass bowl full of green olives sits behind"><figcaption><em>masa44 / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Olive oil is an important part of the Mediterranean diet, an anti-inflammatory eating pattern that’s been linked to liver health benefits. Olive oil has high levels of monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, which may help reduce the accumulation of fat in the liver, lower the risk of heart disease in people with liver conditions like NAFLD, and prevent liver disease.</p><p>A recent 2023 study of 2,436 adults found that those with the highest intake of extra virgin olive oil had up to a 26% reduced risk of NAFLD compared to those with the lowest intake. The protective effect of olive oil against NAFLD was greatest in people with obesity.</p><p>Moreover, the antioxidant compounds found in olive oil could help promote general liver health by protecting liver cells against oxidative damage and preventing inflammation.</p><h2>6. Seafood</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1mH7Gd_plate_of_various_seafood_on_ice.jpg" alt="Plate of various seafood on ice"><figcaption><em>Alexander Spatari / Getty Images. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Seafood is rich in liver-protective nutrients, such as anti-inflammatory fats, and antioxidant nutrients, like selenium and vitamin E.</p><p>Studies show that diets rich in seafood may help reduce liver fat and protect against liver diseases like NAFLD and liver cancer. </p><p>A 2020 umbrella review that included 34 meta-analyses found moderate quality evidence suggesting that each 100g per day increase in fish consumption was associated with a 35% reduced risk of liver cancer.  The researchers noted that seafood’s high content of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids may have protective effects against cancer risk, especially inflammation-driven cancers, such as liver cancer.</p><h2>7-10: Other Liver Protective Foods and Drinks</h2><p>The following foods and drinks are high in nutrients and phytochemicals that can help protect and support the health of the liver:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coffee and tea:</strong> Drinking coffee and certain types of tea has been shown to be protective against liver conditions such as liver cancer. High consumption of coffee and green tea has been linked to a significant reduction in liver cancer risk as well as other liver diseases. </p></li><li><strong>Cacao products: </strong>Eating more cocoa products, like chocolate, may help protect the health of your liver. Some research suggests that chocolate consumption can help lower liver enzyme levels and improve other aspects of health in people with liver disease. However, it’s best to choose cocoa products that contain no or little added sugar, as added sugar is detrimental for liver health.</li><li><strong>Legumes:</strong> Legumes, like lentils and beans, are rich in fiber, a nutrient that supports the health of the liver. Studies show that adding legumes to your diet could help protect liver health by reducing body weight, decreasing liver enzymes, lowering blood pressure levels, and more. </li><li><strong>Nuts and seeds:</strong> Nuts and seeds are highly nutritious and may help decrease the risk of liver diseases such as NAFLD when consumed regularly as part of a healthy diet. However, certain nuts, such as imported peanuts, can be contaminated with toxins called aflatoxins, which can be dangerous for people with liver disease. To reduce your risk of aflatoxin exposure, it’s recommended to only purchase nuts and nut butter from major commercial brands that adhere to strict safety guidelines and to discard nuts that look moldy or discolored.  </li></ul><h2>Foods to Avoid</h2><p>While a diet high in nutrient-dense foods can help protect the health of your liver and support optimal liver function, consuming certain foods and beverages too often could trigger and worsen liver conditions.</p><p>The following foods and drinks should be kept to a minimum for optimal liver health: </p><ul><li><strong>Foods and drinks high in added sugar: </strong>Consuming too much sugar, especially in the form of fructose, can damage the liver and lead to liver fat accumulation. High fructose intake has been consistently linked to an increased risk of fatty liver. Studies suggest that people who consume sugar-sweetened beverages, like soda, daily are more than 50% more likely to develop fatty liver disease compared to people who don’t consume sweetened beverages. </li><li><strong>Red and processed meats:</strong> Red and processed meats are high in inflammatory fats and other compounds that contribute to inflammation and cellular damage. High red and processed meat intake is linked to a greater risk of NAFLD and liver cancer. </li><li><strong>Ultra-processed foods:</strong> Ultra-processed foods, such as packaged snack foods and fast food, are associated with a number of health conditions, including liver disease. Ultra-processed foods should be kept to a minimum to protect overall health, including the health of the liver.</li><li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Excessive alcohol consumption damages the liver and significantly increases the risk of liver diseases, such as liver cancer and alcoholic cirrhosis. Studies show that women who consume one or more drinks per day and men who consume two or more drinks per day have a 42% increased risk of liver cancer incidence and a 17% increased risk of liver cancer death compared to those who drink less alcohol.</li></ul><p>Though not all risk factors for liver disease are within your control, cutting back on the foods and drinks listed above can help protect your liver. </p><h2>How to Add Liver-Healthy Foods to Your Diet</h2><p>In general, a diet high in whole, nutrient-dense foods, like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and seafood, and low in ultra-processed food, alcohol, and added sugar is what’s best for liver health. What’s more, eating a well-rounded diet that prioritizes healthy foods can also help lower your risk of other common health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. </p><p>Here are a few ways to incorporate liver-healthy foods into your diet:</p><ul><li>Add a side salad of fresh vegetables topped with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to your dinners </li><li>Snack on fresh fruit or sliced vegetables and hummus</li><li>Sip on black coffee or green tea in the morning</li><li>Incorporate seafood, like fatty fish, into your weekly dinner menu</li><li>Make a comforting, liver-friendly hot cocoa using cocoa powder, monk fruit, and milk of your choice</li><li>Use fresh or powdered ginger and garlic to add a boost of flavor to your recipes </li></ul><p>Adding nutritious foods to your meals and snacks can help support your liver and reduce your risk of a number of health conditions. </p><h2>Other Ways to Protect Your Liver</h2><p>In addition to following a healthy diet, other factors can positively influence liver health. </p><p>The following lifestyle modifications can help protect against liver disease and promote overall liver health:</p><ul><li><strong>Lose excess body fat: </strong>Carrying excess body fat, especially in your abdomen, is a major risk factor for liver disease.</li><li><strong>Exercise regularly: </strong>Staying active can help you maintain a healthy body weight and reduce liver disease risk.</li><li><strong>Quit smoking and avoid drug use:</strong> Smoking and illicit drug use can injure the liver and lead to other health issues, too.</li><li><strong>Use medications and supplements responsibly:</strong> Overuse or improper use of common medications, like painkillers and herbal supplements, could harm your liver and lead to serious liver-related complications. Never mix medications unless specifically recommended by your healthcare provider. </li><li><strong>Practice safe sex:</strong> Hepatitis, a liver disease, can be transmitted through sexual contact. </li></ul><p>Following a healthy diet and lifestyle and protecting your liver by avoiding medication overuse and toxins like cigarette smoke can help keep your liver healthy and reduce your risk of liver diseases. </p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Your liver performs life-sustaining functions, including removing toxins and waste products from your blood, so it’s important to take care of your liver by following a healthy diet and lifestyle.</p><p>Adding certain foods to your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, ginger, garlic, and seafood, can help promote liver health by reducing inflammation, protecting against cellular damage, and lowering liver disease markers. </p><p>Following a nutrient-dense, well-rounded diet and leading a healthy lifestyle by avoiding practices known to negatively impact the liver, such as excessive drinking, is an easy way to support and protect the liver and promote overall health. </p></main>
