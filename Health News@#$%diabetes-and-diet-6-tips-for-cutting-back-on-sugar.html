    <main><h1>Diabetes and Diet: 6 Tips For Cutting Back on Sugar</h1><p>If you're living with diabetes, you know all too well the importance of monitoring your sugar intake. Excessive sugar can lead to spikes in blood glucose levels, which not only makes it difficult to manage your diabetes, but also increases the risk of long-term health issues.</p><p>Here, we'll look at six simple yet powerful ways to cut back on sugar, helping you maintain stable blood sugar levels and improve your overall well-being. Whether you're newly diagnosed or looking for better control, these tips will help you cut back on sugar in a sustainable, healthy way.</p><h2>1. Drink Plenty of Water</h2><p>Have you ever had a sudden sweet craving or unexpected hunger? Maybe you just ate recently, which makes the sudden attack even stranger. It’s hard to quit sugar when the cravings can be so powerful.</p><p>Luckily, your secret weapon is free and always available: water.</p><p>When you’re dehydrated, the body often confuses this with hunger, which makes you more likely to overeat or reach for unhealthy foods.</p><p>Drinking enough water makes you feel full and flushes out excess sugar from the body, therefore keeping cravings at bay.</p><h2>2. Add More Satisfying Foods to Your Diet</h2><p>Satiating macronutrients are the foods that help you feel full and satisfied after you’ve finished eating.</p><p><strong>The top foods that help keep you full and curb your sugar cravings are:</strong></p><ul> <li>Boiled or baked potatoes</li>  <li>Beans, peas, chickpeas, and lentils</li>  <li>Eggs</li>  <li>Nuts</li>  <li>Lean meats, poultry, and fish</li>  <li>High-fiber foods, such as oats, whole wheat bread, bananas, and carrots</li> </ul><p>If your meals are satisfying, you will be less likely to feel the need for a snack, and cravings will be less likely to take control over your willpower.  </p><figure><img title="2.

Watch Out For Hidden Sugars</h2><p>While cake and ice cream are obvious sugar offenders, you may be missing plenty of other sugary culprits—and some of them may surprise you.</p><p><strong>The top foods that include hidden sugars are: </strong></p><ul> <li>Whole-grain cereals</li>  <li>Granola bars</li>  <li>Pasta sauce </li>  <li>Low-fat salad dressings</li>  <li>Store-bought smoothies</li>  <li>Yogurt</li>  <li>Salad dressings</li>  <li>Milk alternatives such as almond milk and coconut milk</li>  <li>Canned fruit </li>  <li>Bottled tea</li>  <li>Ketchup</li>  <li>BBQ sauce</li> </ul><p>It's helpful to make a habit of checking ingredient labels. Even so-called “healthy” items can be packed with things like added sugar, artificial sweeteners, and corn syrup.</p><figure><img title="3.

Be Mindful of What Sugar You're Drinking</h2><p>It's essential to cut out the most unnecessary (and easily missed) form of sugar: the liquid kind.</p><p>Whether it’s sweetened waters, fizzy sodas, sugary cocktails, or dessert-like coffee beverages, you’re only causing your blood sugar levels to spike, which in turn just triggers your brain to crave more sugar. (A vicious cycle.)</p><p><strong>The best beverage alternatives to help you quit sugar include: </strong></p><ul> <li>Make your own bubbly water (with SodaStream, for example)</li>  <li>Enjoy your own fruit-infused waters</li>  <li>Skip coffeehouse drinks and flavor your own coffee</li>  <li>Start sipping on a cup of tea</li> <li>Try to avoid sweet cocktails and stick with clear liquors, which tend to contain less sugar</li> </ul><figure><img title="4.

Be Mindful of What Sugar You're Drinking. Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5. Pick a Healthier Alternative When You're Craving Sugar</h2><p>Often, when we deprive ourselves of fueling up or wait until mealtime, we get lethargic and distracted. When hunger strikes, the easiest options are often the worst—like cookies, candy, and granola bars.</p><p>Pinpoint these highly sugary snacks and switch them for healthier options that give you energy instead of causing you to crash.</p><p>When the sugar craving hits, try starting with fruit! Bananas, apples, and oranges are some of the best options for satisfying your craving.</p><p><strong>More alternatives to satisfy a sugar craving include: </strong></p><ul> <li>Dark chocolate: Make sure to look for a bar that’s at least 70% cacao</li>  <li>Snack bars that are made with whole foods</li>  <li>Sugar-free mints or gum</li>  <li>Sweet potatoes</li>  <li>Smoothies made with whole fruits</li>  <li>Yogurt that is free of added sugars</li>  <li>Trail mix</li> </ul><h2>6. Cut Back On Simple Carbs</h2><p>Whether it’s pasta, bread, or chips, simple carbs serve as sugar for the body.</p><p>Identify all the refined foods you incorporate into your diet and try to eliminate or replace them one by one so that it doesn’t feel overwhelming or depriving.</p><p><strong>Some simple carb alternative ideas: </strong></p><ul> <li>If pasta is your pal, try cutting your serving in half or using zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash, or lentil noodles. It’s an easy swap that still feels satisfying but gives you way more nutrition.</li>  <li>Swap sandwiches for lettuce wraps.</li>  <li>Try vegetables—they are complex carbs, so they’ll keep you satisfied much longer than simple carbs.</li>  <li>Leafy greens are also a must, as they’re slow-digesting foods that keep you fuller longer. </li> </ul><figure><img title="6.

When you reduce your sugar intake, your body takes notice.</p><p>The symptoms of a sugar withdrawal are not dangerous, but they may be bothersome.</p><p><strong>When cutting out sugar, you may experience the following withdrawal symptoms</strong>:</p><ul> <li>Headache</li>  <li>Fatigue</li>  <li>Irritability</li>  <li>Loss of focus</li>  <li>Insomnia</li>  <li>Extreme cravings</li>  <li>Thirst</li> </ul><p>If you were consuming a lot of refined sugar before starting a detox, these symptoms might be more severe or noticeable. Luckily, your body will adapt to a low-sugar diet over time, and as your intake becomes less frequent, the withdrawal symptoms will become less intense.</p></main>
