    <main><h1>Sweating Can Help You Lose Weight—But Not the Way You Think</h1><p> [table-of-contents] stripped </p><p>Conventional weight loss advice revolves around a mix of diet and exercise. But, if you’ve ever weighed yourself right after a tough workout session or after spending time in a sauna, it’s understandable to wonder: Does sweating help you lose weight?</p><p>The concept of sweating for weight loss has been around for a long time—some people have even invested in so-called “sauna suits” for this reason. But is there anything to the concept of losing weight through sweating alone, or is this a myth? And are there any safety concerns with sweating with the sole purpose of losing weight? Registered dietitians and a personal trainer explain.</p><figure><img title="Uwe Krejci - Getty Images" src="IMG/AA1hDRdC_does_sweating_alone_help_you_lose_weight.jpg" alt="Does Sweating Alone Help You Lose Weight?"><figcaption><em>Does sweating help you burn calories and lose weight?

On a very basic level, you can lose weight when you sweat—water weight. “If you’re simply just going by the number on the scale, yes, you can lose weight by sweating,” says Albert Matheny, R.D., C.S.C.S., co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab. “But you’re just losing water. You’re literally reducing your weight by reducing the amount of water in your system.”</p><p>Meaning, you’re not losing fat in the process. “Sweating itself is just the body’s mechanism to regulate temperature and expel excess heat,” says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy. “While you might notice a decrease in weight after a sweaty workout, this is primarily water weight and not fat loss. As soon as you rehydrate, that ‘lost’ weight will return.”</p><p>Sweating <em>does</em> require your body to expend more energy, though, Keatley says. “Getting hot to the point where you are sweating increases your heart rate, which uses more energy, but the change you see on the scale after that session is just water leaving the body,” he says. “Some fat may have been used as energy during this period, but you shouldn't be able to tell on a scale.”</p><p>By the way, it’s very common for your fluid levels—and water weight—to fluctuate throughout the day. “Water weight is temporary and can fluctuate from one to five pounds daily,” says Keri Gans, R.D., author of <em>The Small Change Diet</em><em>. “</em>Fat loss, on the other hand, is more consistent and you should notice changes in your body composition.” </p><p>Ultimately, experts say that sweating alone is not a good way to lose a meaningful amount of weight. “I wouldn’t make any sort of recommendation to someone that, if you’re looking to lose weight, you should just sweat,” Matheny says. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>How does exercise help with weight loss?</strong></h2><p>Exercise is a slightly different story. While sweating alone won’t make you lose a meaningful amount of weight, exercise (which often causes sweating) <em>can </em>help you lose weight. </p><p>At a basic level, exercise can help create a calorie deficit that could lead to weight loss over time, Matheny says. Meaning that if you burn 300 calories during a run and don’t take in an extra 300 calories from food and drinks, you’ll set yourself up to lose weight over time (if you continue doing this). </p><p>“If you decrease your energy intake and increase your energy output, you will lose weight,” Matheny says. </p><p>But exercise also creates changes in your body that increase your calorie-burning capabilities. “Exercising can help build muscle, which enables your body to burn more calories at rest,” Gans says. The more muscle you gain with exercise, the more your body will get a boost in calorie-burning throughout your day-to-day.</p><h2 class="body-h2">How many calories does sweating burn?</h2><p class="body-text">The act of sweating itself doesn’t really burn calories, Gans says. However, doing exercise that makes you sweaty may cause you to burn more calories—it’s just about the activity you’re doing, not the sweating itself. </p><h2 class="body-h2">What are the benefits of sweating?</h2><p>Sweating is a natural body process and it's an important tool to help you stay cool and comfortable, Dr. Goldenberg says. “Sweating is also important for regulating electrolytes by changing composition of sweat itself,” he adds. (Electrolytes like sodium help with fluid balance in your body and blood pressure control.) </p><h2 class="body-h2">Risks of sweating</h2><p>In general, you’re fine to sweat as needed. But there are some potential risks that can come along with sweating. “There is a risk that you could get dehydrated but sweating isn’t really the problem—it’s more of a lack of fluid intake,” Dr. Rodney says. You’re also at risk of developing an electrolyte imbalance if you have excessive sweating, Dr. Goldenberg says. But, again, that depends on whether you're replacing the fluids you’ve lost. </p><p>The other potential risk is to your skin, Dr. Rodney points out. “Sweat is salty and if you let it sit for a long time on your skin, it can be irritating,” she says. “That can cause itchiness and sensitivity.”</p><h2 class="body-h2">Why do some people sweat more than others?</h2><p>It depends. “Everyone sweats, but there’s variability to how much people sweat,” Dr. Goldenberg says. “Many factors can contribute to this, including genetic and environmental factors. Different people will respond different to different stimuli, such as exercise or a stressful situation.”</p><p>Some people can also develop a condition known as hyperhidrosis, which is a medical condition that causes excess sweating, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). “If your palms are just drenched when you're anxious, that's hyperhidrosis of the palms,” Dr. Rodney says. “If your T-shirts are drenched on a regular basis, that’s hyperhidrosis." </p><p>Medical conditions like an infection, an overactive thyroid, and menopause could also lead to excessive sweating, the Mayo Clinic says. Worth noting, per Dr. Rodney: Some medications like certain beta blockers and antidepressants can increase your risk of sweating, too.</p><h2 class="body-h2">When to see a doctor for sweating</h2><p>If you’re sweating more than you’d like, Dr. Rodney says it’s time to see a dermatologist. “We have a lot of good options to control the sweating,” she says. “As soon as you decide it’s a problem for you, call your doctor. There’s no need to suffer in silence.”</p><p>Also, if you can’t keep fluids in and have signs of dehydration like extreme thirst, dizziness, fatigue, and dark colored urine, it’s a good idea to keep medical care immediately, Dr. Rodney says. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Sustainable weight loss tips</strong></h2><p>If you want to embark on a weight loss journey, Keatley recommends weighing yourself sparingly. </p><p> “Step away from the scale,” he says. “It’s a useful tool but obsessing over the change daily and trying to beat yesterday’s weight will drive you nuts. The long-term stress from weighing yourself like that can lead to elevation of cortisol, which can lead to fat gain rather than loss.”</p><p>Instead, Keatley recommends taking a “holistic approach,” balancing a nutritious, portion-controlled diet with regular physical activity, like walking, for weight loss. “Rather than worry about calories directly, make sure your proteins are naturally low in fat and half your meal is non-starchy vegetables or fruit,” he says. “Stay hydrated, get adequate sleep, and seek support, whether from a registered dietitian, trainer, or supportive community.”</p><p>While doing something like sweating to lose weight sounds tempting, Gans recommends sticking with tried and true weight loss methods. “Do the actual work,” she says. “Move your body more, choose healthier food options, and get adequate sleep.”</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
