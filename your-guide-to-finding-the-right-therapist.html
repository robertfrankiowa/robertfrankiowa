It can take some trial and error to find a therapist who meets your individual needs. Access to therapy often depends on factors like your health insurance and location. Therapists also have different styles, training, and expertise.</p><p>There are many types of therapy, but they can all offer similar benefits. This includes: </p><ul><li>Gaining better insight into your feelings and behaviors </li><li>Making meaning of past experiences </li><li>Improving your self-perception and self-esteem </li><li>Reducing harmful behaviors and thought patterns</li><li>Strengthening relationships</li></ul><p>Taking time to figure out which type of therapy might be valuable for you, researching options, and preparing for your first appointment can help you find a therapist who's a good fit.</p><h2>What Kind of Therapy Might Help You?</h2><p>Therapy isn’t one size fits all. While traditional therapy might bring to mind lying on a couch and talking about your childhood, there are many different therapeutic approaches. Depending on your needs, you may prefer to receive support from more than one type of mental health professional.</p><p>Types of mental health professionals include: </p><ul><li><strong>Psychologists:</strong> Psychologists are qualified to provide individual and group therapy. They can also give mental health evaluations, perform testing, and provide mental health diagnoses. Psychologists must earn a doctorate degree and receive state licensure.</li><li><strong>Counselors and therapists: </strong>Similar to psychologists, counselors and therapists are trained to provide individual and group therapy, as well as complete evaluations and give diagnoses. They are required to get a master’s degree and be licensed in their state. </li><li><strong>Clinical social workers: </strong>In addition to providing individual and group therapy, evaluations, and diagnoses, clinical social workers are trained in case management and advocacy services. They must earn a master’s in social work and be licensed in their state.</li><li><strong>Psychiatrists: </strong>A psychiatrist provides medication management, as well as diagnoses and evaluations. A psychiatrist's main role is often prescribing psychiatric meditation, but they may also offer some talk therapy. Psychiatrists must earn their Doctor of Medicine (MD) and complete residency training.</li></ul><p>Identifying your specific needs and goals can help you decide which type of therapy might be most valuable for you. Ask yourself, “What would my life look like if I got what I needed out of therapy?” Answers might include fewer negative thoughts, more supportive relationships, more effective coping skills, or deeper self-understanding.</p><p>If you’ve been diagnosed with a specific mental illness, your goals may be symptom-specific. For example, someone with bipolar disorder may benefit from support with managing periods of mania and depression, while someone with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may need skills to manage flashbacks. PTSD is a condition brought on by a terrifying or traumatic event that is difficult to recover from.</p><p>Many therapists are eclectic, meaning they utilize different modes of therapy depending on their clients’ needs. However, therapists generally specialize in specific types of therapy. Group therapy is also an option if you want to connect with people you can relate to.</p><p>Types of therapy include:</p><ul><li><strong>Psychodynamic therapy:</strong> A talk-based therapy that explores the unconscious forces and childhood experiences that affect your emotions and behaviors</li><li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> A behavioral therapy that focuses on the relationship between your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.</li><li><strong>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):</strong> A mindfulness-based therapy that helps you accept difficult emotions and thoughts while turning your attention to positive actions</li><li><strong>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT): </strong>A behavioral therapy that focuses on mindfulness, radical acceptance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal skills</li><li><strong>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): </strong>A form of trauma therapy that helps you process traumatic memories and reduce emotional distress</li><li><strong>Creative therapies: </strong>Creative therapy includes art therapy (AT), music therapy (MT), drama therapy (DT), and expressive arts therapy (ExAT). Therapists use creative modalities like visual art, music, writing, and movement as alternative forms of self-expression and exploration in therapy sessions.</li></ul><p>You may try many types of therapy or see several mental health professionals throughout your lifetime. No matter which type of therapy you receive, it’s important to feel like a therapist has provided a safe space for you to discuss your challenges, goals, and needs.</p><h2>Where To Find a Therapist</h2><p>The process of finding a therapist can be intimidating. Access to specific types of therapy can also vary depending on your insurance coverage and location. Here are some ideas to help you get started.</p><h3>Therapist Directories</h3><p>If you have health insurance, you may be able to find a therapist who takes your insurance by using the directory provided by your insurance provider. You can also use general therapy directories. These directories often allow you to filter by:</p><ul><li>Insurance</li><li>Location</li><li>Specialties</li><li>Languages offered</li><li>Types of service</li></ul><p>If having a therapist who shares a similar identity is important to you, some directories include filters like gender, age, sexuality, and ethnicity. Using these filters to narrow down your results can increase your chances of finding a therapist who is right for you.</p><p>Make sure the therapists you find practice in your state. Even if a therapist offers virtual sessions, they can only serve clients in the states they are licensed in. </p><p>Popular therapy directories include:</p><ul><li>GoodTherapy</li><li>ZocDoc </li><li>Psychology Today</li><li>Therapist Locator</li><li>ZenCare</li><li>Alma</li></ul><h3>Personal Recommendations</h3><p>It might be helpful to get support from people you know. For example, you can discuss your mental health concerns with your primary care provider. They may be able to offer recommendations for therapy practices or mental health clinics in your area.</p><p>Friends and family may also have recommendations for therapists in your area or online. If you feel comfortable, share a bit about why you're considering therapy, what your insurance coverage is like, and what you’re looking for in a therapist. People you know might have tips or information about mental health service providers. Talking about therapy with people you trust can also help reduce the stigma around mental health support.</p><h3>Professional Associations</h3><p>Mental health professional associations often have directories of therapists who meet their specific qualifications and standards. For example, the American Psychological Association (APA) offers a Psychologist Locator featuring its members. Other professional associations that offer therapist directories include:</p><ul><li>Academy of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy</li><li>American Psychiatric Association</li><li>National Register of Health Service Psychologists</li><li>American Board of Professional Psychology</li></ul><p>Online therapy platforms offer completely virtual therapy services. Lower cost, convenience, and accessibility are some of the advantages of online therapy platforms. If you live in a rural area that has few therapy options, online therapy platforms allow you to access therapists across your state.</p><p>Some platforms use a combination of chat services, video sessions, and features like mood trackers and skills training. You and your therapist can work together to design a treatment plan that feels most helpful to you.</p><p>It’s important to note that privacy concerns have been raised about some online therapy platforms. However, many therapists offer virtual therapy through HIPAA-compliant online video-conferencing platforms. HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. To be HIPAA-compliant, providers must meet regulations that protect your personal health information.</p><p>Popular platforms that exclusively offer online therapy services include: </p><ul><li>BetterHelp </li><li>TalkSpace</li><li>Cerebral</li><li>Calmerry</li></ul><h2>How To Evaluate and Choose a Therapist</h2><p>There are many factors to consider when deciding which therapists to reach out to, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Credentials:</strong> A therapist’s credentials are public record, meaning you can check them using your state's licensing website. A therapist might also have a professional website that expands on their certifications, professional affiliations, years of experience, and areas of expertise. </li><li><strong>Cost: </strong>Some therapists take insurance, but many do not. If they do, you'll want to clarify how many sessions are covered by your insurance. If you receive out-of-network benefits, you may be able to apply for reimbursement from your health insurance. Some therapists also offer sliding scale fees that vary depending on your income. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the cost upfront to ensure the treatment will be affordable.</li><li><strong>Location and availability: </strong>If you’d like therapy sessions in person, ask about their office hours. Consider whether their office is close enough to your home or workplace. If you work on weekdays, see if they offer evening or weekend sessions.</li></ul><p>You might want to reach out to more than one therapist. When you reach out by phone or email, provide a brief overview of why you're looking for a therapist, and perhaps your goals. Don’t hesitate to ask questions about cost, location, and availability to ensure their services are a good fit for your budget and schedule.</p><h2>How To Prepare for Your Consultation</h2><p>Most therapists will offer a preliminary consultation to introduce themselves, get a general idea of what you're looking for, and make sure they're a good fit. </p><p>In this initial meeting, pay attention to the therapist’s communication style, how comfortable you feel, and your general compatibility. It's important to feel like you can trust the therapist and get a sense of whether or not they might be able to help you. Research shows a good client-therapist relationship contributes significantly to the effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>Some questions you might consider asking during this initial consultation include:</p><ul><li>What kind of therapy do you typically provide for your clients? </li><li>Do you use evidence-based approaches?</li><li>Do you recommend a specific number of sessions or time frame? </li><li>How do you assure confidentiality? Are there any limits to confidentiality? </li><li>Do you have experience dealing with my specific concerns? How much experience?</li><li>What are your goals for therapy and how will progress be assessed? </li></ul><p>Practical questions include:</p><ul><li>Do you offer a sliding scale?</li><li>What's your cancellation policy?</li><li>Will I be charged for missed sessions?</li><li>What hours are you available?</li><li>What if I have an emergency?</li></ul><p>The therapist will likely ask you about your mental health history, your family's mental health history, and your goals for therapy. It may be helpful to write down the timeline of your mental health history—including any medications you’ve taken—in preparation for this initial consultation.</p><h2>What To Expect at Your First Appointment</h2><p>A first appointment with a therapist can be nerve-wracking. Remember that therapy is a process. During your first appointment, your therapist will likely ask you questions to better understand your current challenges and what you’re hoping to get out of treatment. It might feel a bit awkward, but you'll hopefully get a general sense of whether or not this person still seems like a good fit.</p><p>Honor your comfort level and share at your own pace, but try to be honest. Let your therapist know how long you’ve been struggling with specific symptoms, any major stressors in your life, and recent life changes. Topics that are uncomfortable to talk about are often topics you benefit from exploring in therapy. However, the ultimate goal is creating a safe space, and that can take some time to build.</p><p>It may be helpful to engage in a self-care practice before and after therapy. For example, a quick meditation before a session might help you feel more grounded and focused. It might also be helpful to not schedule anything immediately after your session to allow yourself time to process and unwind.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Finding a therapist can be intimidating. Whether you're seeking a therapist to gain more insight about yourself, address specific behaviors, or treat a mental condition, it's important to find a therapist who meets your individual needs.</p><p>Therapist directories, personal recommendations, and professional associations are all places to search for a therapist. When choosing a therapist, consider practical factors like credentials, cost, location, and availability as well as therapeutic considerations like their specialties and experience working with clients who have similar challenges.</p><p>At the end of the day, you want to find a therapist you feel comfortable with who can support you with your specific mental health goals.</p></main>
