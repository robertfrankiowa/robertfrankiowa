Here’s what experts say you can do in the meantime</h2><figure><img title="Getty Images" src="IMG/AA1jagKr_adhd_medication_shortage.jpg" alt="ADHD medication shortage"><figcaption><em>ADHD medication shortage Getty Images. Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p>An ongoing shortage of medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has left many people with no other option than to deal with their symptoms on their own.</p><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person’s ability to focus and control impulsive behaviors. It affects approximately 8 million adults in the United States.</p><p>In addition to behavioral therapy, one of the most effective ways to treat ADHD is with stimulant medications, like Adderall. And although the shortage started with that drug, it quickly bled into the supply of other meds, like Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin, Vyvanse and more. Many of these medications have now been in short supply for more than a year.</p><p>As of October 18, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists still lists more than 140 different doses and formulations of various ADHD medications as currently in short supply. And unfortunately, experts have not expressed much optimism that the supply issues will resolve any time soon.</p><p>“These medications are short-acting and do not stay in your system for long,” LaTasha Perkins, M.D., a family medicine physician based in Washington, D.C., tells The Messenger. “If you don’t have your medication it can definitely exacerbate your symptoms.”</p><p>She adds that suddenly coming off of ADHD medications can affect a person’s ability to focus and increase feelings of anxiety, but there are some steps that can help ease these symptoms in the absence of medication, Dr. Perkins says.</p><p>Here’s what to do if you currently can’t get your ADHD medication.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get enough sleep</h2><p>Dr. Perkins says that being sleep deprived can make the symptoms of ADHD even worse.</p><p>“It is important that everyone is getting the proper amount of quality REM sleep. It will definitely help."</p><p>In addition to exacerbating ADHD symptoms, a lack of sleep has been linked to several health issues, including heart disease, depression and dementia.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get caffeinated</h2><p>Having a cup or two of coffee in the morning can help with focus, Dr. Perkins suggests. </p><p>She says that people should use coffees and teas as sources of caffeine, rather than energy drinks, and that these beverages should not be consumed in excess, as too much caffeine can cause negative side effects of its own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stay hydrated</h2><p>It might sound simple, and it’s certainly not new or trending medical advice, but staying hydrated is critical for anyone to function properly.</p><p>“Being hydrated is going to help your body do its work. It is so important.”</p><p>Hydration recommendations vary based on things like age, weather and activity level, but in general, men need about 15.5 cups of water per day, and women need 11.5 cups per day, according to Mayo Clinic.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Follow a routine</h2><p>Dr. Perkins says that keeping up with simple routines can help improve focus. She says that things like always keeping your keys, purse, coat, laptop or other daily essentials you need in the same location is a good place to start.</p><p>“If you get distracted easily it can be hard to focus on daily activities, and it can affect productivity at work when you get distracted by small things like trying to find your keys.”</p><p>She adds that checklists can help to maintain focus as well. Checking tasks off of a list also helps boost motivation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Say no</h2><p>Taking on additional responsibilities or agreeing to attend events or obligations that you had not previously planned on can throw a wrench into routines.</p><p>“Saying ‘no’ to things that are too spontaneous and would be too much of a distraction can also affect productivity,” Dr. Perkins says. “So if you weren’t planning on going to dinner on Saturday and you were planning to organize your house or something, stick to the original plan.”</p><p>She says that veering away from the original plan is more likely to fuel anxiety and frustration.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicate</h2><p>Whether it is extra time for a project or extra patience from a spouse or co-worker that you need, Dr. Perkins says that making the people around you aware that you might need a little extra time and grace could reduce feelings of pressure and stress.</p><p>“Be as honest as you can about needing help,” she suggests. “You don’t have to tell them about your diagnosis, but communicating your needs to the people around you is important.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ration medications</h2><p>If you do have your medications but are anticipating that it may be difficult to get them in the near future, Dr. Perkins says that you may be able to skip a dose during certain times in order to save it for other designated times when you know you will need it.</p><p>For example, if you are headed into a weekend when you don’t have any plans that require a great deal of focus, it’s okay to save that dose for another day when you know you will need it (like at work or during class).</p><p>“If you use it to help you focus at work or at school and you have days when you’re not working or going to school, when you’re just exercising or hanging out or watching Netflix, save the weekend dose for the week when you really need it,” Dr. Perkins suggests.</p><p>If you are someone who has more mild symptoms and takes multiple doses throughout the day, she says it’s okay to prioritize when you take the medication based on when you need it the most, like during a presentation or shift at work.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this method will vary from person to person based on their unique scenario, and it may not be an option for everyone. If you’re planning to ration your medication, discuss it with your medical provider first.</p></main>
