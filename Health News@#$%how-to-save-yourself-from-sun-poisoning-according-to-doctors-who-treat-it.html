Braving the heat for a cookout, tennis match, or just to walk the dog can lead anyone to wonder if they’re going to get a extreme sunburn, sometimes called sun poisoning, before they can get back inside.</p><p>Of course, <em>you</em> apply sunscreen and cover your skin when you’re under some serious UV rays. But everyone else should know how to handle a bad sunburn, and be familiar with the signs of heat stroke.</p><h2>What is sun poisoning?</h2><p>Anything with the word “poison” in it is pretty ominous. But while sun poisoning is no joke, you can’t technically be diagnosed with it. Rosanne Paul, DO, an assistant professor of dermatology at Case Western Reserve University, explains that sun poisoning isn’t a genuine medical term, but is widely understood to be a severe sunburn that causes a systemic reaction in the body with symptoms similar to a viral illness like the flu. “The UV rays are not ‘poisoning’ you, but sun poisoning means that the skin did get damaged, causing dehydration,” she says.</p><p>Dermatologist and founder of Sandia Dermatology Deeptej Singh, MD, also describes sun poisoning as a severe sunburn. He explains that sun poisoning goes beyond the redness, discomfort, and peeling skin associated with sunburns. It includes these symptoms but also includes other symptoms unrelated to what your skin looks like. The symptoms of sun poisoning can include headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, and even a change in mental state.</p><p>Heather Hinshelwood, MD, the co-owner and Chief of Medicine of The Fraum Center on Hilton Head Island, has seen her fair share of sun poisoning. Not only has she lived in high sun areas her entire life (including Florida, Southern California, and South Carolina), she’s a former Marine who was deployed to Afghanistan. “Excess sun exposure and its complications is something we constantly fight in the military and here in the South,” she says.</p><p>Something Dr. Hinshelwood says many people don’t realize about sun poisoning is that it doesn’t <em>always</em> include getting sunburned. Your skin can be well-protected with proper clothing and SPF, but it’s the sheer heat that gets you. “Sun poisoning can be caused by a heat injury and can include heat strokes,” she says. A heat stroke occurs when the body overheats and its core temperature rises above 104 degrees. Its symptoms include a throbbing headache, confusion, nausea, dizziness, fainting, and a fast heartbeat. It can be fatal.</p><p>The doctors explain that sun poisoning exists on a spectrum; sometimes it’s mild and sometimes it’s severe. “Blistering is a sign of mild sun poisoning,” Dr. Singh says. But he emphasizes that this doesn’t mean it isn’t serious. “It’s a big deal because even a single blistering sunburn at any point in your life increases your lifetime risk of developing skin cancer,” he says. This is especially pertinent considering that men are diagnosed with melanoma at a much higher rate than women.</p><p>While anyone can get sun poisoning, Dr. Singh says that some people are more at risk. This includes people with light-colored skin, eyes, and hair. Individuals with a genetic condition called xeroderma pigmentosum (characterized by heightened skin sensitivity) are also more at risk. Also: “People who take certain medications that make them more prone to sunburn, and babies and young children tend to be more at risk,” Dr. Singh adds.</p><h2>How much time in the sun causes sun poisoning?</h2><p>Obviously no one wants to get sun poisoning, but you probably don’t want to spend your entire summer indoors either. So, what’s the threshold? How much time in the sun and heat causes it? Dr. Hinshelwood says that the amount of heat and sun someone can bear without getting sun poisoning varies greatly. For example, someone who is used to the heat isn’t going to get sun poisoning as easily as someone who is used to a milder climate.</p><p>“The duration of exposure it takes to get sun poisoning depends on latitude, altitude, and preparedness of the skin,” Dr. Singh adds. “What this means is that if you are living in a cold-weathered climate and fly to a different geographic location, your skin is not going to adapt as quickly as you can fly there. So the locals, even those with the same skin tone, will have a better capacity to detoxify ultraviolet radiation.”</p><p>Instead of going by some sort of made-up formula about how much time you can spend in the sun before being at risk of sun poisoning, Dr. Singh recommends keeping an eye on your skin while you’re outside. “Is it hot? Is it turning red? This means it is burning and it is time to get out of the sun. Even dark skin can turn red, and the trained eye can detect it. People know when their skin is speaking to them, but sometimes inadvertently they may fall asleep in the sun and escalate their damage,” he says.</p><h2>How to treat sun poisoning</h2><p>If you end up with sun poisoning, it’s important to know how to treat it. All three doctors say that sometimes you can treat it on its own. Other times, it’s important to call 911 or head to the emergency room. It depends on how bad your sun poisoning is. (Remember, sun poisoning exists on a spectrum). If what you’re dealing with is burnt, blistering skin and mild dehydration, Dr. Hinshelwood says you can treat it on your own by drinking lots of water (or an electrolyte-based beverage) and putting cold compresses on your skin. “Depending upon how bad it is, slowly rehydrating, taking a cool shower or bath, cold compresses, and topical steroids may be all that’s needed,” Dr. Singh says.</p><p>If your sunburn is severe (as in blistering skin lesions) or you’re experiencing the other symptoms (confusion, changes in mental state, dizziness, nausea, or a fever), these are all signs to see a doctor ASAP. “Extreme heat stroke will kill you without intervention,” Dr. Hinselwood says.</p><p>Dr. Hinshelwood says the first step paramedics or a doctor are going to take to treat sun poisoning is attempt to cool the body down. That means stripping you down to your undies and putting cold compresses on your body. They might pour cold water all across your body too. You can also expect to be given an IV, since sun poisoning and dehydration tend to go hand-in-hand.</p><p>To treat the blistering sunburn part of sun poisoning, popping an ibuprofen and applying aloe vera to your skin can help. You should also keep your skin covered and stay out of the sun until it heals. (Not that you’ll likely be itching to get back outside anytime soon.)</p><h2>How to protect yourself from sun poisoning</h2><p>Of course, never getting sun poisoning in the first place is way better than nee to treat it. Dr. Singh says that most of preventing sun poisoning comes down to common sense. “People often get into trouble when they stop listening to their own bodies. At the sign of redness and excessive skin warmth, it’s time to re-evaluate your strategy and take a break from the sun,” he says.</p><p>A lot of it comes down to the sun protection basics you already know: If you’re going to be spending time in the sun, wear clothing that protects your skin and sunscreen. If you’re bald, you need to apply sunscreen to your head too. Personally, Dr. Hinshelwood wears SPF 50 and recommends this SPF strength to anyone who is going to be out in the sun. Dr. Paul says that at the very least, go for SPF 30 to protect yourself.</p><p>Remember, sun poisoning can be caused by heat too, which means you can experience it without getting burnt. It’s something Dr. Hinshelwood saw first-hand when she was in the Marines and deployed to Afghanistan. Marines were wearing sun-protective clothing and wearing SPF, but some got sun poisoning from being in high heat (she says temps reached 112 degrees) for multiple days in a row with little relief. To protect yourself from the heat stroke part of sun poisoning, she says to stay hydrated, and to get out of the sun if you start experiencing any of the symptoms related to a heat stroke, such as feeling confused, dizzy, or faint.</p><p>If you’re vacationing somewhere warmer than where you live, Dr. Hinshelwood says it’s important to be extra cautious; you aren’t going to be able to maintain the same activity level that you’re used to back home. “I used to live near Joshua Tree National Park, and at least once a year there are tourists who end up with sun poisoning—and worse—because they didn’t acclimate appropriately,” she says.</p></main>
