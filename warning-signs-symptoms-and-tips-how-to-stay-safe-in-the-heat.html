    <main><h1>Warning signs, symptoms and tips: How to stay safe in the heat</h1><p>(WGN) — Extreme heat doesn’t just zap our energy, it can also damage vital organs in our bodies, including the brain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>To help you stay safe amid scorching temperatures this summer, here are a few things you should know:</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Drink plenty of fluids</h2><p>Dr. Andrew Costello, an emergency medicine physician with Endeavor Health in Chicago, said it’s important to drink fluids, like water and sports drinks, before your summer activities. </p><p>“If you are exerting yourself playing sports, and you don’t pre-treat by drinking a lot of fluids… it may be hard to catch up with the losses that occur when you sweat a lot,” Costello said. </p><figure><img title="Provided by WDKY Lexington" src="IMG/BB1otJe4_warning_signs_symptoms_and_tips_how_to_stay_safe_in_the_heat.jpg" alt="Warning signs, symptoms and tips: How to stay safe in the heat"><figcaption><em>(Credit: Getty Images).

Costello explained that excessive heat can cause vasodilation, which occurs when your blood vessels expand and allow more blood to flow through them. This can lead to a drop in blood pressure and potential fainting, he said. </p><p>As for how much water you should drink, the CDC recommends consuming 1 cup (or 8 ounces) every 15-20 minutes to combat heat exhaustion. However, the agency cautions against drinking more than 48 ounces per hour.</p><p>“Drinking too much water or other fluids (sports drinks, energy drinks, etc.) can cause a medical</p><p>emergency because the concentration of salt in the blood becomes too low,” the CDC notes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">More tips</h2><p>If you want to be active outside when it’s hot, you do so during the cooler parts of the day, such as the morning or evening, according to the CDC. Also, wear lightweight clothing and take frequent breaks in shady areas.</p><p>The best rule of thumb, however, is to stay indoors with air-conditioning — whether it’s at home, the library or a public cooling center. The American Red Cross said relying on an electric fan to stay cool is not safe since it can’t protect against heat-related illness. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is heat related illness?</h2><p>Think of heat-related illness as a spectrum. It starts with cramping as you lose fluids. The next level is heat exhaustion, which can lead to more profound symptoms like a headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. </p><p>The third and most dangerous stage is heat stroke. Its symptoms include altered mental status, seizures, clotting abnormalities, and liver damage. </p><p>“That’s a life-threatening emergency that needs to be seen and treated in the ER quickly,” Costello said. “We have cooling blankets, and we use misted water with fans to help the evaporative process to dissipate heat.”</p><figure><img title="Provided by WGN-TV Chicago" src="IMG/BB1osYgs_warning_signs_symptoms_and_tips_how_to_stay_safe_in_the_heat.jpg" alt="Warning signs, symptoms and tips: How to stay safe in the heat"><figcaption><em>(Credit: WGN).

Diabetics and people who take certain blood pressure medications are also “at higher risk for heat-related illness,” he explained. </p><p>Older patients are similarly at greater risk and frequently end up in the emergency room. They should avoid the heat if possible.</p><p>Even otherwise-healthy people can feel the effects that often sneak up as we navigate a steamy summer. “You can certainly feel weak and fatigued with low blood pressure and early electrolyte abnormalities,” Costello said.</p><p>Click here for more safety tips. </p></main>
