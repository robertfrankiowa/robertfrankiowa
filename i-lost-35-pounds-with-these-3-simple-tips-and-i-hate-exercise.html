She starts the day with an egg, spinach, and halloumi wrap and then has a tuna, kale, sweet potato, and avocado salad at lunch. "I usually aim to include protein at breakfast, like eggs and dairy, which also have a range of important minerals," she told NW Magazine. "A savory breakfast means I can throw in some vegetables, plus wholegrain carbs for slow-release energy." She also loves fish. "I try to include fish a few times a week for lean protein and important omega-3 fats. I add some pumpkin and sesame seeds for extra minerals, protein, and healthy fats," she said.</p><h2>2 She Loves Food Prep</h2><p>Skye is a big fan of food prepping."A salad or noodle bowl is a quick lunch option," she said in the same interview. She might also have a berry smoothie or a spoonful of nut butter for a quick fuelling.</p><h2>3 She Is an Intuitive Eater</h2><p>Balance is key, says Skye. "I like intuitive eating and to allow myself one or two treat meals a week. It does depend on what's happening, though. If I have a photo shoot or something coming up, I'm a bit more strict with myself because I know I have a goal to achieve, but generally, I allow a couple of treats. My favorite 'treat' foods are chips and chocolate," she told Women's Best.</p><h2>4 She Changes Her Diet When She Needs To</h2><p> [/slidetitle]</p><p>"It's always about what my gut will tolerate. I'm working on fixing that. I like to eat basic, unprocessed, and organic food wherever and whenever it's possible. I like the hunter-gatherer diet, organic meats, fish, nuts, and seeds. I don't have much in the way of bread or pasta just because it doesn't agree with my tummy. My diet is all about how I feel when and after eating the food!" she told Women's Best.</p><h2>5 She Allows Herself Treat Days</h2><p> [/slidetitle]</p><p>Skye doesn't use the terminology "cheat" days. "I call them treat days. I don't like the negative connotation attached to the word cheat because you're not cheating yourself! I think we all deserve to have something that we enjoy and not worry about what it's doing to our bodies," she told Women's Best.</p><figure><img title="5 She Allows Herself Treat Days" src="IMG/BB1nO8GV_5_she_allows_herself_treat_days.jpg" alt="5 She Allows Herself Treat Days"><figcaption><em>5 She Allows Herself Treat Days. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 5 Workouts a Week</h2><p>Skye works out 5-6 times per week, sometimes at midnight. "Some people might think my progress is due to my genetics or because of breastfeeding, but I can tell you it's got a LOT to do with hard work and consistency," she wrote in an Instagram post. "All those midnight workouts I did after Mia fell asleep and eating healthy meals from my FIT Program are getting me great results."
