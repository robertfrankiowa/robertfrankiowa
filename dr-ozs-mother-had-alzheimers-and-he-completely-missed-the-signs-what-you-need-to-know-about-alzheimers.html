    <main><h1>Dr. Oz's Mother Had Alzheimer's and He "Completely Missed" the Signs-What You Need to Know About Alzheimer's</h1><h2>Signs of Alzheimer's to Watch Out for</h2><p>Symptoms of Alzheimer's can be late or early-onset. With late-onset, symptoms begin to appear in a person's mid-60s; in early-onset, between 30s and 60s (although this form is rare) .</p><p><strong>There are several signs you can be aware of when it comes to Alzheimer's disease, including :</strong></p><ol>   <li><strong>Short-term memory loss.</strong> The person may ask the same questions over and over, forgetting things you recently told them. Unlike age-related memory loss, the person will be unable to recall the information later.</li>   <li><strong>Difficulty keeping up with work or bills.</strong> If the person begins to consistently have trouble keeping track of bills or doing tasks they perform often, this could be a sign of cognitive decline.</li>   <li><strong>Loss of sense regarding time or location.</strong> They may forget where they are, or be unable to recall the day, year, or how much time has passed. </li>   <li><strong>Vision changes.</strong> Yes, changes in vision can point to Alzheimer's disease in some cases. The person may have trouble determining color, distance, or reading.</li>   <li><strong>Issues with language.</strong> You may be in a conversion with someone when they will suddenly stop and not remember what they were talking about, and be completely unable to recall it, even later.</li>  </ol><p>The person may also repeat themselves, or consistently struggle to find the right word, sometimes using substitutes in place of words.</p><figure><img title="Signs of Alzheimer's to Watch Out for" src="IMG/BB1nTZV4_signs_of_alzheimers_to_watch_out_for.jpg" alt="Signs of Alzheimer's to Watch Out for"><figcaption><em>Signs of Alzheimer's to Watch Out for.

For example, they may put the TV remote in the silverware drawer, and not recall what they did with it. Some patients may accuse others of stealing when they cannot locate an item.</li>   <li><strong>Changes in decision-making.</strong> If you notice a loved one has gotten more careless with their money, or their appearance has become unkempt or altered, or they engage in reckless or irrational behavior, these could be signs of Alzheimer's.</li>   <li><strong>Disengagement.</strong> The person may no longer want to socialize or attend events or engagements they used to. </li>   <li><strong>Mood or personality changes.</strong> In Alzheimer's disease, sometimes patients experience changes that can alarm loved ones-they may be easily upset, become confused, afraid, depressed, or even distrustful.</li>  </ol><p>Now that you know what to look out for, what can you do if you suspect a loved one is suffering from Alzheimer's?</p><figure><img title="Oz says his mother would say " you="" look="" pretty="" prettier="" today",="" instead="" of="" saying,="" "you="" look="" beautiful="" today.""="" src="IMG/BB1nU57k_oz_says_his_mother_would_say_you_look_pretty_prettier_today_instead_of_saying_you_look_beautiful_today.jpg" alt="Oz says his mother would say " you="" look="" pretty="" prettier="" today",="" instead="" of="" saying,="" "you="" look="" beautiful="" today.""=""><figcaption><em>Oz says his mother would say "You look pretty prettier today", instead of saying, "You look beautiful today.".

Before broaching the topic, invite them to talk with you in a familiar space, and don't rush the conversation .</p><p>Begin by asking if they've been feeling differently or struggling lately. Then, try to persuade them to see their primary care physician. If they are reluctant to do so, you can still contact their doctor yourself and voice your concerns-the physician cannot disclose information about a patient to you, but they can listen .</p><figure><img title="Ways to Help Family Members Suffering from Alzheimer's" src="IMG/BB1nTQAW_ways_to_help_family_members_suffering_from_alzheimers.jpg" alt="Ways to Help Family Members Suffering from Alzheimer's"><figcaption><em>Ways to Help Family Members Suffering from Alzheimer's.

By preparing yourself, you can determine the best way to respond to their changing behavior or abilities. It's important to be patient and show you care!</li>  </ul><ul>   <li><strong>Support them and their family.</strong> Sometimes offering an ear to listen or helping them with their daily tasks can make a big difference for those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's!</li>  </ul><ul>   <li><strong>Don't exclude them.</strong> Excluding the person with Alzheimer's or their family doesn't help anything. Keep them included in your plans, or invite them to do something simple like going for a walk.</li>  </ul><ul>   <li><strong>Give it time.</strong> Just because you offer to help someone now and they decline, doesn't mean you shouldn't ask again later. For many families, the diagnosis will continue to change their lives.</li>  </ul><figure><img title="What else can you do to support someone who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or who you believe has a form of dementia?" src="IMG/BB1nTVti_what_else_can_you_do_to_support_someone_who_is_suffering_from_alzheimers_disease_or_who_you_believe_has_a.jpg" alt="What else can you do to support someone who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or who you believe has a form of dementia?"><figcaption><em>What else can you do to support someone who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or who you believe has a form of dementia?.

Conventional treatment for Alzheimer's focuses on prescription medications that help people maintain their cognitive function and manage the behavioral changes that come with the disease .</p><p>Natural therapies for Alzheimer's focus on the Mediterranean diet, which research has shown can "<em>protect brain health</em>" to reduce the brain tissue damage associated with Alzheimer's .</p><p>Exercise has also been shown to be beneficial for patients with Alzheimer's as it improves cognitive function, and blood flow to the brain, and helps patients preserve their ability to do daily living tasks. Exercise has even been shown to increase hippocampal volume, the part of the brain we discussed earlier that's essential for forming memories .</p><p>To prevent Alzheimer's disease, experts say that eating a healthy diet, exercising, and getting enough sleep are essential to reducing your risk ! Is someone you know suffering from Alzheimer's disease? Don't miss the warning signs, and don't chalk up forgetfulness or odd behavior to old age-talk with your loved one about scheduling an appointment with their primary care provider to assess their risk for Alzheimer's and get a potential diagnosis!</p></main>
