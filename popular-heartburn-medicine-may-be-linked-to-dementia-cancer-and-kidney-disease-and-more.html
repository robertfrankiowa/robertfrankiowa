    <title>Popular Heartburn Medicine May Be Linked To Dementia, Cancer and Kidney Disease, and More</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a popular class of drugs used to treat heartburn, acid reflux, and other conditions. However, these widely used medications also have been linked to a variety of health problems, including kidney damage, bone fractures, and dementia (1).

    <main><h1>Popular Heartburn Medicine May Be Linked To Dementia, Cancer and Kidney Disease, and More</h1><h2>Heartburn Drugs Linked to Dementia, Kidney Disease, and Stomach Cancer</h2><p>The 2019 study found specifically that people who took PPIs and H2 blockers were at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease (aka heart disease), chronic kidney disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer. Even at low doses, this risk increases. Other research has also linked PPIs to even more potential health risks. This includes dementia, bone fractures, heart disease, and pneumonia.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">   <p><em>"Taking PPIs over many months or years is not safe, and now we have a clearer picture of the health conditions associated with long-term PPI use,"</em> said Ziyad Al-Aly.</p>   <p>The data doesn’t lie. Their research shows specifically, 15 per 1,000 of the PPI users died from heart disease; four per 1,000 from chronic kidney disease, and two per 1,000 from stomach cancer. Death rates due to cardiovascular disease were 88 among the PPI group and 73 among the H2 blockers group. For stomach cancer, death rates were six in the PPI group and four in the H2 blockers group. Death rates due to chronic kidney disease were eight and four in the PPI and H2 blocker groups, respectively. </p>   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s worse, is that more than half of PPI users were using these medications without actual medical need. </h2>     <p>Despite this, they had received a prescription to use them. On top of that, the low-dose prescriptions are essentially the same dosage as over-the-counter PPI. This means that there are any number of people purchasing these at drug stores without medical guidance and taking them not knowing of the risks.</p>   <p><em>"PPIs sold over the counter should have a clearer warning about potential for significant health risks, as well as a clearer warning about the need to limit length of use, generally not to exceed 14 days,"</em> said Ziyad Al-Ali. <em>"People who feel the need to take over-the-counter PPIs longer than this need to see their doctors."</em></p>  </blockquote><h2>What’s worse, is that more than half of PPI users were using these medications without actual medical need.</h2><p>Despite this, they had received a prescription to use them.

They work by reducing the amount of acid produced in your stomach, which helps to treat heartburn, ulcers, and other conditions caused by too much acid in your digestive tract. Histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers) are another type of antacid that blocks histamine receptors in the stomach. Both PPIs and H2 blockers are available over the counter and are used to treat a variety of issues, including (2):</p><ul>   <li>Heartburn and acid reflux (GERD)</li>   <li>Stomach ulcers</li>   <li>Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)</li>   <li>Erosive esophagitis</li>   <li>Other stomach and intestinal conditions</li>  </ul><p>PPIs are sold under the brand names Aciphex, Nexium, and Prevacid. H2 blockers are sold under the brand names Pepcid, Tagamet, and Zantac. Both types of antacids can be used together to treat heartburn and other digestive issues. </p><figure><img title="What Are PPI and H2 Blockers?" src="IMG/BB1oW0tK_what_are_ppi_and_h2_blockers.jpg" alt="What Are PPI and H2 Blockers?"><figcaption><em>What Are PPI and H2 Blockers?.

This equates to millions of people. Previously published studies had already linked these medications to kidney disease and heart problems. To determine whether or not this led to an increased risk of death, the researchers had to dig into some medical records. </p><p>They looked at millions of veterans' medical records in a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs database. They identified 275,933 people who had been prescribed a PPI and 73,355 people prescribed an H2 blocker between October 2006 and September 2008 and noted how many died and when over the following five years.</p><p>They then concluded that for every 500 people taking PPIs for one year, there is one death as a result that wouldn’t have occurred for any other reason. While that may not seem like much, when you take into account the tens of millions of people who take them, this equates to thousands of unnecessary deaths each year. The longer people use the drugs, the higher the risk of death. The recommended treatment length for most of these drugs is two to eight weeks. There are no re-assessments, however, and people end up taking these medications for months or even years.</p><figure><img title="Problematic Prescriptions?" src="IMG/BB1oW0ue_problematic_prescriptions.jpg" alt="Problematic Prescriptions?"><figcaption><em>Problematic Prescriptions?.

They contain the same ingredients as prescription PPIs, just at lower doses. This has led to an increased risk of severe complications such as fractures or kidney disease, though the exact statistics on this are difficult to obtain. Just like with prescription medications, overuse can cause more harm than good. (3)</p><h2>PPIs Are Still Necessary, But Caution is Needed</h2><p>According to the senior author of the Washington University studies, Ziyad Al-Aly, MD PPIs are still a useful and important tool. <em>"PPIs save lives,"</em> Al-Aly said. <em>"If I needed a PPI, I absolutely would take it. But I wouldn't take it willy-nilly if I didn't need it. And I would want my doctor to be monitoring me carefully and take me off it the moment it was no longer needed."</em></p><p>However, Al-Aly also thinks people may be taking them when they aren’t needed. <em>"A lot of people may be taking PPIs unnecessarily,"</em> Al-Aly said. <em>"These people may be exposed to potential harm when it is unlikely the drugs are benefiting their health. Our study suggests the need to avoid PPIs when not medically necessary. For those who have a medical need, PPI use should be limited to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible."</em></p><figure><img title="PPIs Are Still Necessary, But Caution is Needed" src="IMG/BB1oW0uS_ppis_are_still_necessary_but_caution_is_needed.jpg" alt="PPIs Are Still Necessary, But Caution is Needed"><figcaption><em>PPIs Are Still Necessary, But Caution is Needed.

They can help you avoid hospitalization and surgery. For many, they’re the only thing that works. If you're taking a PPI, you should still see your healthcare provider regularly. They may be able to lower your dosage or change it entirely if they notice that you don't need it anymore.</p><p>As a side note, a more recent 2020 study found no link between Alzheimer’s and PPI use but did note a slight increase in non-Alzheimer dementia (5). If you have a history of acid reflux, it’s always best to talk with your healthcare provider before taking any medication-even over-the-counter PPIs. Ensure you are well informed on the risks and how to take PPIs properly.</p></main>
