    <main><h1>How To Talk About Your Weight Loss Wins With Others Who Are Still Struggling</h1><p>Losing weight can bring numerous benefits, but it has its challenges, too. This may be especially true if you have relatives and friends who are also unhappy with their weight but not yet ready — or able — to lose weight or make lifestyle modifications. The good news is that there are ways to discuss your weight loss goals and successes with your loved ones without creating tension or hurting their feelings. </p><h2>The Influence of Family and Friends</h2><p>There are multiple possible causes for being at a higher weight. One of them may be your family and cultural traditions.</p><p>This was the case for 38-year-old Nicole Silva of Atlanta, who recently lost 80 pounds. She says her family regularly gathers on the weekends and for holidays with food at the center of the festivities. “We eat when we celebrate, grieve, or just come together to spend time,” Silva says.</p><p>Texas-based licensed psychologist Ebony Butler (who goes by Dr. Ebony professionally) says that what we eat is passed down from one generation to the next. Limited access to healthy food options and a lack of awareness of how to maintain a healthy diet can affect how less nutritious eating habits are learned and shared, says the expert, who is a food relationship strategist with a private practice in Austin.</p><p>One study found that the less a parent knows about healthy nutrition options, the more likely their children will have a higher or unhealthy body weight. Another study found that parents with a higher body mass index (BMI) are more likely to have children who also have higher BMIs, and the higher the parent’s BMI, the higher their children’s BMIs will likely be.</p><h2>Challenges Around Nutrition</h2><p>Choosing healthier foods to eat is not always easy, Dr. Ebony says. Many foods that are marketed as being healthy are anything but nutritious. For example, certain salads have dressings and other condiments that have a great deal of sugar and calories. Some flavored yogurts may be heavily sweetened.</p><p>Food deserts are another common cause of unhealthy weight gain and poor familial eating habits. D. Bing Turner, MPH, executive director of Heritage Wellness Collective and co-founder of Heritage Farmer’s Market in Los Angeles, describes food deserts as neighborhoods and communities that have low to no access to healthy, fresh food options such as grocery stores and farmers markets. Food deserts generally have a higher number of fast-food restaurants and smaller convenience stores, and are typically in lower-income or more rural communities. “Food deserts are usually found in areas that are lived in, primarily communities of color. You see this happening in many major cities and rural areas,” says Turner.</p><p>The term “food desert” also considers the affordability of local grocery stores for residents living in that area. Turner says that even if a grocery store is present in a low-income neighborhood, unemployment, low-wage jobs, and other factors make them unaffordable to the surrounding community. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 1 in 8 Americans are food insecure, and the same report estimates that 2.3 million Americans live more than one mile from a grocery store and do not own a car.</p><h2>5 Ways to Talk About Weight Loss Tactfully</h2><p>You’ve made lifestyle and diet modifications. You might be worried that discussing your weight loss goals will make things awkward around your loved ones, but it doesn’t have to — as long as you’re careful about who you choose to share with and how you do so, Dr. Ebony says. Here are five tips from the expert.</p><h3>1. Consider Your Words</h3><p>“It’s important not to judge or ridicule others who have not decided to lose weight,” Dr. Ebony says. Appearing judgmental can happen even when that’s not your intention at all. Although you can’t always be responsible for the discomfort of others, Dr. Ebony says you should be thoughtful in choosing your words when talking about body size, weight, dieting, and other topics that can be fraught for many people.</p><h3>2. Solicit Permission</h3><p>When in doubt, ask your friends and family members how they feel about you discussing your diet with them. If they’d prefer not to hear about it, accept their answer. If you know that a family or friend is unhappy with their weight and doesn’t appear interested in your weight loss experience, it may be best not to bring this topic up as much with that person.</p><h3>3. Acknowledge Your Own Challenges</h3><p>Losing weight can be difficult. If your family member is unhappy with their weight and expresses difficulty getting started or staying motivated with dietary changes, normalize their experience, says Dr. Ebony.</p><p>Be transparent about your own challenges and setbacks. For example, you might say, “I know losing weight can sometimes suck, and [it isn’t easy] when cravings kick in. So, I tried my best to keep myself busy and always have healthy snack options lying around. But I understand how hard it can be — it’s not just you.”</p><p>Humor helps, too. Approach conversations gently and informally. A little humor can go a long way — as long as it’s not directed toward the person you’re talking to.</p><h3>4. Don’t Expect Validation From Everyone</h3><p>Manage your expectations of others. Not everyone will be happy about your weight loss journey, and that’s okay. Friends and family can be key members of your support system, but there are other ways to build community around your health care goals, including joining online forums or support groups, or speaking with a weight loss professional. </p><p>Invite your friend or family member to take a walk with you or do another non-food-centric activity you both enjoy. This will give you the opportunity to bond and have fun together in a low-key way. Focus on other areas of interest you share and continue to value who they are, how important they are to you, and how much you appreciate their role in your life.</p><p>Silva, for example, found it helpful to ditch talking about weight altogether. Instead, she brought up healthy and easy recipes and food suggestions that she enjoys. </p><h2>Prioritize Your Connection</h2><p>Silva had to eventually accept that not everyone in her life was supportive of her weight loss. She worked on not taking it personally. When she did talk about her weight loss with certain family members, she was careful to do so in a way that focused on her and her health. “I would share my personal experience and how I noticed my weight affected my health and confidence,” Silva says.</p><h2>Weight Loss Can Be Challenging</h2><p>We all know how hard it can be to lose and maintain a healthy weight and the emotional and physical toll that weight issues can have on a person. It’s important to keep in mind that each individual’s journey is personal. Be careful not to impose your desires for yourself — or others — onto them before they’re ready, Dr. Ebony says.</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
