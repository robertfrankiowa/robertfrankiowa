    <main><h1>How to Begin an Exercise Routine as a Part of Your Obesity Treatment Plan</h1><p>Exercise and regular movement are essential for overall health and are an important factor in weight loss—though not the only factor. Obesity is a complex disease that increases the risk of additional diseases, like cancer, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. However, participating in recommended levels of daily activity can reduce risk and is essential to obesity treatment.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults get in two days of muscle-strengthening exercises a week in addition to one of the following:</p><ul><li>150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly</li><li>75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise weekly</li></ul><p>Knowing where to begin when you’re starting to exercise—whether it’s your first or 50th time—can be daunting. As an exercise physiologist, I support my clients in making short- and long-term movement goals. We discuss their likes and dislikes to find physical activities they can stick with long-term and consider their current fitness level to help them avoid doing too much too soon and risk injury.</p><h2>Set Actionable Goals</h2><p>When beginning an exercise routine as a part of your obesity treatment plan, consider why you want to lose weight. Once you pinpoint your “why,” you can create goals to support it.</p><p>I suggest making actionable goals using the acronym “SMART,” which stands for the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Specific</strong>: Be specific about your health and activity goals so you are clear on what you are working toward.</li><li><strong>Measurable</strong>: Make sure you can measure your progress and outcomes. For example, you can track the number on the scale, your blood pressure, or the distance you can walk before taking a break.</li><li><strong>Achievable</strong>: When setting your goals, ensure you have the necessary resources (such as time and energy).</li><li><strong>Realistic</strong>: Set realistic goals based on your current health and fitness levels.</li><li><strong>Timely</strong>: Create specific time frames for your goals. You may set long-term goals for six months or more in the future, such as a target weight or decreased blood pressure. Set short-term goals every four weeks to measure your progress along the way.</li></ul><h2>Pace Yourself</h2><p>Managing obesity through exercise and achieving health outcomes, such as losing weight or reducing your blood pressure, can take some time, but the benefits begin at the cellular level—before you see a change on the scale.</p><p>Pay attention to how you feel. I have clients tell me that they notice being able to get up the stairs easily or getting in and out of the car without thinking about it, and those are signs of progress. Tracking your goals and monitoring your progress can help you stay motivated and stick with your program.</p><p>Progress takes time, and not seeing the results you want as fast as you want should not be discouraging. You must give yourself grace and time to adjust to a new routine.</p><h2>Make It Fun</h2><p>I always tell my clients, “You know yourself better than anyone else, so come up with a plan to make exercise enjoyable for <em>you</em>”—you’re more likely to stick with an exercise you enjoy. “Fun” activities are different for each person. Here are some things you could try:</p><ul><li><strong>Cardio machines</strong>: Try using cardio equipment, such as an elliptical or rowing machine.</li><li><strong>Aerobics classes</strong>: Join an in-person or online aerobics class, such as Zumba, Pilates, or interval-based classes.</li><li><strong>Weight training</strong>: Make weight training more challenging by increasing the amount of resistance, repetitions, or the number of sets you perform.</li></ul><p>Remember to choose physical activities you enjoy, in an environment you’re comfortable in, and at a time you can commit to long term. For example, if you know you are not a morning person, don’t plan to wake up every day at 5 a.m. to work out.</p><p>Or, if you’re not comfortable exercising around other people, don’t join a gym. Instead, start by walking around your neighborhood in the evening or exercising in your house; following an exercise routine on YouTube is just as effective as going to the gym.</p><p>Small equipment, such as hand weights or resistance bands, is becoming more accessible outside of the gym, and many available resources can help you devise a plan that works for you from the comfort of your home.</p><p>If you want to join a gym, shop around until you find a comfortable environment, such as women-only gyms if you are a woman or those catering to specific age groups. Choose a fun physical activity or find ways to make it more enjoyable by listening to music you love or exercising with a friend.</p><h2>Keep It Safe</h2><p>Exercising with obesity can present specific challenges, such as increased pressure on your joints. I help my clients determine their current or starting fitness levels and choose exercises that minimize their risk of injury when beginning a new exercise program. Once they're comfortable, we make various adjustments to increase the intensity.</p><p><p>"Staying safe when starting a new exercise program is essential to reducing the risk of injury or giving up because the program is too difficult."</p><p>It's essential to take five to 10 minutes to warm up before exercising and an additional five to 10 minutes to cool down afterward. Warming up allows your body to gradually prepare for intentional exercise, while the cooldown allows your body to gradually relax after a session.</p><p>Depending on your chosen physical activity, a warm-up could include walking at a slow pace or performing dynamic stretches, and a cooldown could include walking at a slow pace or performing static stretches.</p><p>When you are ready to start, choose an activity you are already comfortable with, like walking. Then, select two or three days of the week to walk and follow that schedule. Once it becomes easy, find small ways to challenge yourself, such as increasing the duration, wearing a weighted vest, or carrying small hand weights while you walk.</p><h2>Consider Professional Advice</h2><p>If you are unsure where to start or have concerns about how exercise will affect any preexisting injuries or health conditions you may have, consult an exercise professional, such as an exercise physiologist, a physical therapist, or a personal trainer.</p><p>As an exercise physiologist, I develop an in-depth understanding of my clients and their goals. During our first session, we discuss their medical history and anything that could limit their ability to participate in certain exercise activities. I assess their current fitness level, including their gait (how they walk), range of motion in their joints, posture, and balance.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease requiring a multipronged treatment approach. Exercise is one key component of treatment. To set yourself up for success with a new exercise routine, don’t make it more complicated than it needs to be. Start where you are and progress slowly.</p><p>Life will undoubtedly get in the way sometimes, so give yourself grace. You won’t be perfect, and that’s OK. Be as consistent as possible and celebrate the small wins as you work toward your long-term goals.</p><p><em>As told to Aubrey Bailey</em>.</p>
