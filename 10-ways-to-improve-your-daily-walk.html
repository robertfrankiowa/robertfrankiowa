    <main><h1>10 Ways to Improve Your Daily Walk</h1><h2>Stretch it all out before you get going</h2><p>“A good way to start your walk is by stretching your back every morning, including neck, shoulders and hips,” says Dr. Nguyen. “Doing so will help you get ready for your morning walk and prevent aches and pains.” </p><h2>Take a mini-walk several times a day</h2><p>If your work requires you to sit for prolonged periods during the day, make sure to stand, stretch and take a quick 30-second walk about every 30 to 60 minutes. “[Extra movement is] good for your body and will help you add more steps during the day,” says Dr. Nguyen. </p><figure><img title="Take a mini-walk several times a day" src="IMG/AAUizcH_take_a_mini_walk_several_times_a_day.jpg" alt="Take a mini-walk several times a day"><figcaption><em>Take a mini-walk several times a day.

Catching up on podcasts can also be something to look forward to in the same regard.</p><figure><img title="Incorporate good music into your walk" src="IMG/AAUiwD5_incorporate_good_music_into_your_walk.jpg" alt="Incorporate good music into your walk"><figcaption><em>Incorporate good music into your walk.

You can do this by exploring a new-to-you park or trail and getting in a short hike if you need to mix things up from your usual walk around the block. </p><figure><img title="Explore a new route and get in touch with nature" src="IMG/AAUisCF_explore_a_new_route_and_get_in_touch_with_nature.jpg" alt="Explore a new route and get in touch with nature"><figcaption><em>Explore a new route and get in touch with nature.

But packing a bottle of water (bonus points if it’s spruced up with some lemon or is even sparkling) is key for ensuring you’re well hydrated and can keep your walk enjoyable, especially in warmer months.</p><h2>Change into actual workout clothes</h2><p>Yes, it’ll add some extra time that may seem like a drag at first, but changing into comfortable clothing can make all the difference when it comes to getting in the right mindset for a walk. Feeling good about what you’re wearing may lead you to go a little further or add some pep to your step too.</p><h2>Make it a strength session combo</h2><p>If you want to break more of a sweat during your walking session, adding weights is a great way to do that while also building strength. “If you’d like to go the extra mile (pun intended) — adding some light weights as tolerated can also be beneficial for bone health,” says Dr. Nguyen.</p><h2>Or make it a power walk</h2><p>Increasing the pace and intensity of your walk is another way to boost cardiovascular impact. Before you know it, you may feel ready to upgrade your endorphin high with a jog.</p><figure><img title="Or make it a power walk" src="IMG/AAUizd4_or_make_it_a_power_walk.jpg" alt="Or make it a power walk"><figcaption><em>Or make it a power walk.

It should come as no surprise that you can enjoy live walks on the app for outside or on the treadmill. This is a surefire way to make walks more enjoyable if you’re looking to mix things up.</p><h2>These Are the 15 Best Movies to Watch With Friends</h2><p>These Are the 15 Best Movies to Watch With Friends</p><h2>Budget Friendly Hacks for Entertaining at Home</h2><p>Budget Friendly Hacks for Entertaining at Home</p></main>
