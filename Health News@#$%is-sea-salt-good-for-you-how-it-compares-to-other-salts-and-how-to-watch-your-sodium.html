    <main><h1>Is sea salt good for you? How it compares to other salts and how to watch your sodium</h1><p>When we think of our favorite foods, what do they have in common? Generally, they are either sweet (like ice cream) or salty (like a cheeseburger) We like these foods because they are rich in nutrients that our body needs to survive: sugar and salt. Although we need and love them, too much of either of these things can have consequences for our health. </p><p>In this article, we will focus on salt. But not just any salt – sea salt. </p><p>While the health risks associated with too much sodium (salt) are well established, is sea salt any different? We spoke with the experts to find out what you need to know about sea salt. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Is sea salt good for you?</h2><p>Salt transcends being “good for you” – it’s a mineral that is vital for our survival. Dietitian Lena Beal, MS, RDN, LD, and National Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says, “Sodium (salt) is a mineral and we need minerals like sodium and potassium for everything that we need (in our bodies.)” </p><p>Sea salt and the table salt that most of us are used to (including Kosher salt) are, nutritionally, almost identical. The difference comes down to a few minor things: taste, texture and how it’s processed. But the benefits and risks of sodium for sea salt and table salt, or other types of salt, are essentially the same. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Is salt healthy: yes or no?</h2><p>The Mayo Clinic says that while sodium is important for the balance of fluids, and the functioning of nerves and muscles in your body, too much sodium can lead to an increased risk of:</p><ul><li>Heart disease</li><li>Stroke</li><li>Kidney disease</li></ul><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Which salt is the healthiest? </h2><p>Most salts are fairly similar in their nutritional content. What it boils down to is what percentage of sodium is in a serving. Beal urges people to look at nutrition labels so that they can be informed about how much sodium they’re taking in. </p><p>The biggest difference between sea salt and other types of salt is the way that it is processed. Compared to table salt, sea salt is going to contain more trace minerals because the minerals won’t be stripped away. Gila Singer, RD, CSG, CDN, FAND, a dietitian with Northwell Health explains, “Sea salt may differ from other salts in that it can contain trace amounts of additional minerals like magnesium, potassium and calcium, depending on the source.” However, she adds that the amount is very small, so it might not make a big difference. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Is sea salt good for high blood pressure? </h2><p>The effect is going to be similar whether or not it’s sea salt or another type of salt. However, since the crystals are bigger with sea salt, the same amount of sea salt, by weight, may actually contain less sodium than table salt. But, again, you will want to look at the nutrition label to know how much sodium you’re taking in per serving. </p><p><strong>What do minerals do for the body? </strong>Calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc and what to know.</p><p>The key to salt consumption is balance – take in the recommended amount, (about 2,300 mg) but be careful with consuming too many salty foods. Beal recommends against eating processed foods, as these foods tend to contain high levels of sodium. </p></main>
