There’s the obvious causes, from sunburn to overheating. But have you noticed a change in the frequency of your bowel movements after days of hot weather? When even a day of activity and healthy meals can’t seem to make you go #2, what gives?</p><p>We talked to gastroenterologist Rabia de Latour, M.D., and she confirmed that there is a reason why you might be constipated during a heat wave. Here’s what the doctor had to say—and the easiest way to fix the issue ASAP.</p><h2>Why Is It Hard to Poop During a Heat Wave?</h2><p>The sneaky reason why you may be constipated during a heat wave? Your body needs more water, and this is actually a top cause of constipation any time of the year.</p><p>“Whenever you're dehydrated, the first way your body deals with that is to concentrate your urine and your stool,” de Latour explains. “It’s begging, ‘please give me water!’ and it will sweep it up from your stool and soak it up. So your stools end up being harder and your urine ends up being darker, it's more concentrated.”</p><p>This is the reason why your pee may change color in the summertime, too. But back to poop: because your stool isn’t soft enough, it makes it harder to expel, causing constipation. And if you’re dealing with the opposite issue—diarrhea—de Latour says that it’s due to the same reason.</p><p>“If you're in extreme heat and you're suffering from heat exhaustion, you can shock the gut,” she warns. “It can either cause diarrhea or constipation, but no matter what, it's usually from dehydration.”</p><p>So what can you do to help aid healthy bathroom breaks? There’s an obvious solution. </p><p>“What you need to do is hydrate, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate,” de Latour says.</p><p>This is your sign to fill up your reusable water bottle (or an excuse to buy a new one), stock up on hydrating foods and remind yourself to drink enough water every day this summer.</p><h2>More Tips to Help You Go</h2><p>If you’re reading this article and thinking to yourself, “I’m definitely drinking water, but I’m still having tummy troubles,” then the heat may not be the problem. Here are some simple solutions that may help with regularity:</p><ul><li><strong>Eat enough fiber.</strong> “Unfortunately, our country has a huge, massive issue: we're wildly under-eating fiber and it's very dangerous,” de Latour says. And the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans backs her claim: 90 to 97% of Americans aren’t consuming enough fiber in their diets. With our delicious high-fiber recipes, you can easily incorporate more fiber-packed ingredients into each meal.</li><li><strong>Go on walks.</strong> Aerobic exercise such as walking can help regulate your bowel. And a recent study shows that taking daily walks can increase your odds of living longer by 28%. Talk about a win-win!</li><li><strong>Take a supplement.</strong> Through her partnership with Iberogast, de Latour recommends taking a supplement with gut-healthy ingredients to promote proper digestive function, saying: “I absolutely love offering natural remedies for modern tummy troubles, so when someone comes in with a non-specific GI symptom, a lot of times you can find a natural remedy to an issue that they're having. That way, they don't have to immediately go to medication.” If you’re interested in this option, talk to your doctor or gastroenterologist to see if this is the right solution for you.</li></ul><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>It’s normal to be constipated during a heat wave—and it’s probably because you’re dehydrated. By staying hydrated this summer, you can combat constipation and lower your risk of overheating, so be sure to drink plenty of water. But if you’re having long-term GI issues, be sure to talk to your doctor about your symptoms.</p></main>
