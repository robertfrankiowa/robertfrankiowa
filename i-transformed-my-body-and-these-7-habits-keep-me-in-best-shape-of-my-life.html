    <main><h1>I Transformed My Body and These 7 Habits Keep Me in Best Shape of My Life</h1><p>Your best body is very personal. What one perceives as one's best body may be different from others. For example, you may want to be lean or curvy, while someone else wants to appear muscular. It is not one size fits all, so it is important to identify what you are seeking. As a person who transformed my body and a fitness influencer who motivated thousands of people, I like to start with what is your why?</p><p>My why is to be strong and muscular; my workouts are designed for that. I lift heavy and hard. If you want lean, you may want to spend more time doing yoga and running, while someone seeking curves will need another type of workout. That said, here are my seven secrets to getting your best body.</p><figure><img title="I Transformed My Body and These 7 Habits Keep Me in Best Shape of My Life" src="IMG/BB1oro9b_i_transformed_my_body_and_these_7_habits_keep_me_in_best_shape_of_my_life.jpg" alt="I Transformed My Body and These 7 Habits Keep Me in Best Shape of My Life"><figcaption><em>I Transformed My Body and These 7 Habits Keep Me in Best Shape of My Life. deezworkoutz/Instagram</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 Habit Stack</h2><p>Once you create one good habit, stack on other good habits. For example, if you make coffee every morning, why not drink water while your coffee is being made? Habit stack is taking supplements with water. Get it?</p><h2>2 Eat Well</h2><h2>3 Get Plenty of Sleep</h2><p>I get plenty of sleep, which is so important to muscle repair and growth.</p><h2>4 Exercise</h2><p>Now, workout type matters. Lifting weights is so important. Do that 3-4 times a week. It burns faster than cardio. Muscle will burn fat while you are resting, and a pound of muscle will burn 3X more calories than a pound of fat.</p><h2>5 Daily Affirmations</h2><p>Spend one minute telling yourself how GREAT you are every morning!</p><figure><img title="5 Daily Affirmations" src="IMG/BB1oro9r_5_daily_affirmations.jpg" alt="5 Daily Affirmations"><figcaption><em>5 Daily Affirmations. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Be Positive</h2><p>Maintain a positive attitude. Mental health is important to overall body health. Letting the negative in can affect your actions, so you are not making the progress you seek.</p><figure><img title="6 Be Positive" src="IMG/BB1orqGv_6_be_positive.jpg" alt="6 Be Positive"><figcaption><em>6 Be Positive. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Edit Your Friends List</h2><p>You are the people you spend time with. My closest friends are those who also like to work out and do active things. I don't spend a lot of time with drinking buddies. I have yoga buddies.</p><h2>8 Simply Start</h2><p>You can incorporate any of my tips by simply starting. Don't try to do too much at once. Promise yourself to try one thing a month until it becomes a habit. These are small steps that anyone can take. You have to try. I always tell my classes it is all in the try, and once you do it, you are on your way. Take the first step, and the rest will get easier.</p><figure><img title="8 Simply Start" src="IMG/BB1orfrC_8_simply_start.jpg" alt="8 Simply Start"><figcaption><em>8 Simply Start. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Final Word From the Pro</h2><p>Your best body is within you. You can unlock it with mental strength. that is truly step one. Most people think step one is going to the gym. Step one is uncovering your why and finding peace with why you are not already on this journey, fixing what is broken, giving yourself grace, and moving forward. maintain a positive attitude, and don't let any setback throw you off track. Find like-minded people to spend time with and it will change your life. And if you enjoyed this article, don't miss 12-3-30 Walking Method: 20 Proven Tips to Lose Weight Faster.</p></main>
