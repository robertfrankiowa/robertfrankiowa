    <main><h1>23 Most Nutritious, Healthy Fruits</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Jamie Johnson, RDN</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Jamie Johnson, RDN</strong><p>Fruit, nature's bounty, comes in various colors, shapes, and flavors and provides abundant nutrition. Fruit is naturally rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, disease-fighting phytochemicals, and more. Eating a variety of fruits maximizes nutrition, providing different types of antioxidants and beneficial compounds.</p><p>Research consistently demonstrates that diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate recommendations for fruit vary based on calorie needs. For example, for people who eat a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, it is recommended to have about 2 cups of fruit per day. Other considerations include your health goals and nutrient requirements.</p><p>The fruit you choose to eat will depend on various factors, including availability, taste preferences, cultural traditions, nutrition goals, and allergies. If you have a gastrointestinal disorder, fruit sugar might be hard for you to digest, which can limit your options.</p><p>This article covers the 23 healthy types of fruit, their nutritional content, and health benefits.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pOyIi_a_person_slicing_orange_wedges_at_home.jpg" alt="A person slicing orange wedges at home"><figcaption><em>PeopleImages / Getty Images.

They contain ample amounts of nutrition and their crunchy, sweetness makes for a great sensory experience.</p><p>One medium apple with the skin on provides 4 grams of fiber (soluble and insoluble). Soluble and insoluble fiber is important for gut health, blood sugar regulation, cholesterol, and satiety. Apples also contain polyphenols (quercetin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, anthocyanin), which have antioxidant effects.</p><h2>Citrus Fruits</h2><p>Citrus fruits are a great source of vitamin C, which is a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals, reactive molecules produced by cell metabolism that can damage the cell and promote inflammation. When there is an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants, oxidative stress results.</p><h3>Grapefruit</h3><p>Pink, white, and ruby red grapefruit are low in calories and rich in fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin A.</p><p>Pink grapefruit contains lycopene. This carotenoid is responsible for the pink color. Lycopene is an antioxidant associated with maintaining bone strength, reducing the risk of certain cancers (specifically prostate), and supporting heart and vascular health.</p><p>Grapefruit can interact with many types of medications. If you have a medical condition requiring you to take medication, reach out to your healthcare provider to ensure it's safe to eat grapefruit.</p><h3>Lemons</h3><p>Lemons are one of the lower-sugar fruits, with only 1.5 grams in one lemon. They are also rich in vitamin C, providing 33% to 40% of your daily needs in one serving. Pairing foods high in vitamin C with iron-rich foods can increase iron absorption.</p><p>Use lemon zest in salad dressing, marinades, pasta dishes, sauces, and more.</p><h3>Limes</h3><p>Limes are a refreshing and tasty addition to beverages like water, dips like guacamole, salad dressings, and marinades.</p><p>One whole lime contains 7 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, and only 1 gram of sugar. Limes are also rich in vitamin C.</p><h3>Oranges</h3><p>The different varieties of oranges—including blood oranges, navels, Valencias, and mandarins, among many others—have unique colors, shapes, and flavors and slightly different nutrient profiles. Not only are oranges considered delicious and hydrating, but they are also rich in vitamin C and fiber and contain calcium, potassium, folate, phosphorus, and beta-carotene.</p><p>Oranges provide a dietary source of the flavanones hesperidin and naringenin, which have been researched for their potential to reduce blood pressure and improve blood vessel health.</p><p>The juice of an orange in marinades and dressings can add flavor and nutrition while limiting fat and sodium.</p><h2>Berries</h2><p>Berries are another grouping a healthy fruits.</p><h3>Blackberries</h3><p>With their deep purple-black color, blackberries are one of the most antioxidant-rich fruits. Their antioxidants include anthocyanins (a phytonutrient that gives them their color) and polyphenols. Blackberries include compounds that are linked with improved brain health, enhanced memory, and reduced inflammation and oxidative stress.</p><p>They are also rich in fiber, vitamin K, vitamin C, manganese, and folate. One cup of blackberries has a whopping 8 grams of fiber or about 21% to 32% of your daily needs.</p><h3>Blueberries</h3><p>Commonly referred to as a superfood, blueberries are nutrient-dense. Blueberries are full of fiber and anthocyanins, and they contain vitamin C, vitamin K, magnesium, and manganese.</p><p>Observational studies suggest that eating even a small amount of blueberries daily (about one-third cup) is associated with reduced risk of certain chronic disease. Research on the health benefits of blueberries for cognitive, heart, and metabolic health is ongoing.</p><p>A study published in 2022 suggests that adding wild blueberries to your eating plan may reduce age-related cognitive changes affecting how your brain processes information. People with cognitive decline who consumed blueberry powder daily had improved processing speed compared to the placebo group (a control group in a study given a substance of no medicinal value).</p><p>Add blueberries to oats, low-fat yogurt, whole-grain pancakes, baked goods, grain dishes, salads, smoothies, fruit bowls, and more.</p><h3>Kiwifruit</h3><p>The entire kiwifruit (skin and all) can be consumed. It is packed with fiber, folate, potassium, and plant-based compounds. Eating the skin can double the fiber content. Fiber is important for gut health, bowel regularity, and satiety and supports healthy cholesterol and blood sugar.</p><p>Eating two kiwifruit a day can fill your daily vitamin C needs. One study suggests that for people deficient in vitamin C, eating two kiwifruit per day can improve feelings of vitality, including mood and energy.</p><h3>Pomegranate</h3><p>The edible seeds of pomegranates, called arils, can be purchased in containers or removed from their whole fruit form. Pomegranates are a good source of fiber, folic acid, and vitamins C and K. They contain polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects.</p><p>Pomegranate juice contains compounds associated with reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ("bad cholesterol") and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ("good cholesterol").</p><h3>Strawberries</h3><p>Strawberries are naturally delicious and nutritious. One cup contains 100% of your daily needs for vitamin C, a vitamin that supports your immune system, the formation of collagen (a protein important for skin health), and wound healing.</p><p>In addition, strawberries are rich in fiber, manganese, and other antioxidants.

Lutein and zeaxanthin intake is associated with a decreased risk of progression of age-related macular degeneration (a problem with the eye's retina, affecting central vision) and cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye).</p><p>Freeze peaches for a refreshing after-dinner snack, eat them whole or slice them into yogurt, oats, or salads.</p><h2>Tropical Fruits</h2><p>The tropical fruit category also has many healthy fruits.</p><h3>Bananas</h3><p>Bananas are convenient, portable, and economical and are available all year long. They are rich in carbohydrates (great for energy) and contain fiber, various B vitamins, magnesium, and potassium.</p><p>One medium banana provides about 9% of the recommended daily value (DV) for potassium, an essential nutrient that supports heart and bone health. Snack on a banana before a workout, add sliced bananas to your oats or blend it into a smoothie.</p><h3>Dragon Fruit</h3><p>Dragon fruit, also known as pitaya, pitahaya, or strawberry pear, is a hydrating tropical fruit that contains antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin A. The fruit has an oval shape and small, black edible seeds (similar to kiwi), and the pulp has a sweet and sour taste.</p><p>Dragon fruit varieties are most commonly found in specialty stores or Asian supermarkets. You can blend it into smoothies, eat cubes raw, add it to mocktails, or dice it and mix it with onions, tomatoes, and spices for a refreshing salsa.</p><h3>Durian</h3><p>Durian (<em>Durio zibethinus</em>) is known in some regions of the world as the "king of fruits."

Olive oil is a key component in the Mediterranean diet and is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Contrary to popular belief, you can cook with olive oil, even at higher temperatures.</p><h2>What Is the Healthiest Fruit in the World?</h2><p>It's nearly impossible to determine which is the healthiest fruit. Fruits contain different types of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and plant-based compounds. These work together to promote health and well-being.</p><p>Certain fruits contain higher amounts of specific vitamins, minerals, fat, and sugar, which have specific health benefits. Eat many different fruits to get multiple benefits,</p><p>If you have specific dietary needs or goals, allergies, or issues with digesting specific types of fiber or fructose,, you may have to avoid some fruits.</p><h2>What Are the Best Low-Sugar Fruits?</h2><p>Most fruits contain some fructose, a monosaccharide (single sugar molecule) considered a natural sugar. There are no added sugars in fruit unless they are dried and sweetened.</p><p>The amount of sugar in fruit will depend on the water and fiber content and the serving size. For example:</p><ul><li>1 cup of whole strawberries contains 11 grams of carbohydrates, of which 3 grams are fiber and 7 grams are sugars.</li><li>1 medium-sized banana contains 105 calories and 27 grams of carbohydrates, of which 3 grams are fiber and 14.4 grams are sugar.</li></ul><p>Berries, melons, and citrus fruits (lemons, limes, oranges) are among the lower-sugar fruits. Certain fruits also have a lower glycemic index, a complex rating system that ranks carbohydrates on a scale of 1 to 100 based on how much they raise blood sugar.</p><p>This does not mean fruits that are higher in sugar per serving are unhealthy. There are times when a high-sugar fruit is welcomed, such as after a workout or when recovering from an illness.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Eating a variety of fruits is a great way to include water, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Fruit adds color, texture and flavor to meals and snacks and can serve as a naturally sweet dessert. The best fruit to eat are the ones that are accessible, affordable, meet your nutrition and health goals, and the ones you enjoy eating.</p></main>
