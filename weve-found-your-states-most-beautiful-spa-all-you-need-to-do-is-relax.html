    <main><h1>We've Found Your State's Most Beautiful Spa, All You Need To Do Is Relax</h1><h2>Alabama: Spa at the Grand National, Opelika</h2><p>This pretty spa in eastern Alabama has a serene décor scheme, reflecting the fauna of Lake Saugahatchee and the Auburn-Opelika area. It’s ideal for a post-golf wind-down with whirlpools, infrared saunas, and both men's and women’s lounges. Most standard spa treatments are available, with massages, body scrubs, facials, and manicures/pedicures all on the menu, as well as salon services.</p><h2>Alaska: Tides Spa, Homer</h2><p>The Tides Spa at the Homer Inn promises a unique Alaska oceanside experience. The thermal spa offers everything guests need to stay warm and relaxed in the northernmost state, with a Finnish-style sauna, solar tepidarium, hydrotherapy tubs and showers, and self-care yurts, complete with massage chairs and oxygen therapy, all overlooking the ocean from the Kenai Peninsula. Book a package to get a taste of all the amenities.</p><h2>Arizona: Life in Balance Spa, Tucson</h2><p>Arizona is famous for its intense spa and wellness retreats and the Miraval’s Life in Balance Spa gives visitors an authentic experience with a day visit option. The day package grants access to the spa’s steam rooms, saunas, and lounges and the resort’s trio of heated pools, restaurants with credits that can be used for wellbeing activities, or the extensive list of massages and other spa services.</p><h2>Arkansas: Turtle Cove Spa, Mt. Ida</h2><p>Located just off Lake Ouachita, Turtle Cove Spa is accessed via a suspended wooden bridge, giving guests the feeling that they’re entering a world of relaxation and rejuvenation. The specialty here is holistic treatments, with therapies like crystal energy balancing, sound therapy, and Indian foot detoxes all on offer. Guests can also opt for more standard spa services like hot stone massages, personalized facials, and body scrubs.</p><h2>California: Rancho Valencia, Rancho Santa Fe</h2><p>California is unsurprisingly rich with places to pamper and beautify yourself and this resort near San Diego is one of the most luxurious. Designed to look like a lush getaway with gardens and olive groves, the spa leans towards natural herbs and botanicals in its high-end wellness treatments. The list of services is lengthy, with everything from toxin-draining lymph drainage to harmonizing gemstone massages available.</p><h2>Colorado: Spa Anjali, Avon</h2><p>Specializing in “spa journeys” that evoke the spirit of the nearby mountains with therapies that involve a pine poultice or a river stone massage, the beautiful Spa Anjali at the Westin Riverfront caters to tired bodies from the adjacent Athletic Club and anyone else who needs some nurturing. The spa’s aesthetic is tied to nature and spiritual healing, with calming colors and a saline lap pool that can be accessed by spa guests.</p><h2>Connecticut, Mayflower Inn and Spa, Washington</h2><p>The achingly quaint Mayflower Inn is apparently the real-life inspiration for the American comedy-drama series <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, but more importantly, it has one of the most magnificent spas in Connecticut. The surrounding gardens create an immediate sense of retreat and the unique farm-chic décor speaks to the inn’s sense of place and history, despite a redesign in 2020. The therapists take a holistic approach to healing and wellness, with signature experiences including integrated detox and craniosacral therapies.</p><h2>Delaware: The Bellmoor Inn and Spa, Rehoboth Beach</h2><p>Situated in a small Atlantic Coast beach town, The Bellmoor is a historic hotel with a light and airy design and an ultra-comfortable spa area to match. The soothing color scheme and comfortable furniture set the stage for a transformative selection of services, including a CBD oil massage, a French vanilla latte body scrub, and a facial that employs actual diamond powder as well as other luxuriant treatments.</p><h2>Florida: Eau Palm Beach Resort and Spa, Manalapan</h2><p>Palm Beach is the place to go to play and be pampered in Florida and this expansive resort is one of its most gorgeous properties. The Eau Spa calls itself the “shrine of me” and is focused on sheer pleasure and opulence. Massages and facials are on the menu, but guests can also sip Champagne in the Self-Centered Garden, make a wish for themselves at the wishing well, and enjoy some alone time pre- or post-treatment in the personal garden villas.</p><h2>Georgia: Poseidon Spa, Savannah</h2><p>The very ritzy Mansion on Forsyth Park in Savannah contains the equally ritzy Poseidon Spa, a posh facility that specializes in treatments inspired by the cleansing power of water. Guests can relax in tranquil treatment rooms before taking in a premium custom facial with an added hydrating face mask or sinking into a personalized massage.</p><figure><img title="Georgia: Poseidon Spa, Savannah" src="IMG/AAN1atR_georgia_poseidon_spa_savannah.jpg" alt="Georgia: Poseidon Spa, Savannah"><figcaption><em>Georgia: Poseidon Spa, Savannah. Mansion on Forsyth Park, Kessler Collection/Facebook</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Hawaii: Kahala Hotel and Resort, Honolulu</h2><p>Guests can drink in the best of Hawaiian wellness techniques and ingredients at this serene spa that mimics the natural wonder of the Pacific Islands. Signature treatments make use of things like volcanic clay, taro honey, hemp, and warm pohaku stones to pass the healing spirit of Hawaii onto weary bodies and sunburnt skin. You can also add a dip in the infinity bath onto your packages for maximum relaxation.</p><h2>Idaho: The Cove, Shore Lodge, McCall</h2><p>The town of McCall sits on Payette Lake and represents the beauty of the Idaho wild, which is reflected in the rustic spa at Shore Lodge. The spa offers a series of forest-inspired massages, facials, and body treatments, but the facility stands out because of its saltwater immersion pools, including an outdoor pool where guests can bask in the surrounding Idaho landscape as they relax after their treatment.</p><h2>Illinois: Chuan Spa, The Langham, Chicago</h2><p>The cool tones and Asian-inspired décor of this luxury spa in Chicago get guests in the mood for the facility’s extraordinary Chinese-style treatments. The word “chuan” translates to “flowing water” and the spa is designed to make customers feel like they’re effortlessly floating through a day of rejuvenation. Guests indulge in a bathing ritual that includes an herbal sauna, an aromatherapy shower, and a steam room before receiving a signature massage, scrub, or traditional medicinal treatment.</p><h2>Indiana: A Place to Float, Indianapolis</h2><p>A downtown float spa doesn’t sound like it’s likely to stand out or be particularly beautiful, but this Indianapolis favorite is decorated in a hip but not-too-fussy style to help prime clients for some life-changing water therapy. The floats themselves involve guests being suspended in a warm salty solution in complete silence to help stabilize mood and regulate the electrolytes in the body.</p><h2>Iowa: Potosa Spa, Dubuque</h2><p>Named in honor of the daughter of a chief in the Fox Native American tribe, this spa takes its cues from Indigenous healing methods like the sacred Fox Medicine Wheel. Located in the Hotel Julien Dubuque, Potosa Spa is elegant and understated while being respectful to Indigenous traditions, creating a sense of peace so that guests can fully enjoy massages, bath and body ceremonies, and detox wraps.</p><h2>Kansas: Rock Haven Spa, Hays</h2><p>The name of this Kansas day spa is literal – this little haven of serenity is indeed decorated with naturally beautiful rocks. Local wildlife can be spotted on the rural property while guests take a load off between complimentary bathing rituals and treatments like blue stone massages and cactus agave body wraps. Rock Haven is a treat for the nose too, thanks to signature essential oils designed to relieve muscle fatigue and calm the nerves.</p><h2>Kentucky: Mokara Spa, Louisville</h2><p>The smooth lines and pastel colors of Mokara Spa at the glamorous Omni Hotel in Louisville create a stress-free environment to get customers ready for a solid few hours of assisted recharging. The calming color scheme appears throughout the treatment rooms, where guests can bliss out while getting a nutrient-rich Kentucky Kombucha facial or a Magnesium Melt massage.</p><h2>Louisiana: Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans</h2><p>The French Quarter isn’t all about boisterous excitement – for guests of this elegant hotel day spa, it’s a place for contemplation and spa luxury. The location informs the philosophy of the spa’s treatments, which channel the cultural history of New Orleans. The spa temporarily has a limited menu while the space is being renovated, but visitors will soon be able to enjoy treatments like the Voodoo Ritual and a couple’s massage with coffee and praline once again.</p><h2>Maine: Cliff House, Cape Neddick</h2><p>The waves of the ocean lapping on the coast of Maine are relaxing in their own right, but this spa takes that serenity to the next level, being perched on a cliff with floor-to-ceiling windows that look out onto the water. The décor is clean and simple, with an on-site gym and treatments that take their cues from the power of the sea. The Salt of the Sea massage treatments change with the seasons to make the most of the spa’s natural setting.</p><h2>Maryland: Four Seasons Hotel, Baltimore</h2><p>A waterfront spa in the heart of Baltimore, the spa at the Four Seasons offers gorgeous views and a pristine facility right in the heart of the city. The cool and inviting space has developed treatments for every taste, ranging from traditional massages to no-touch services that employ the best of modern technology. With the knowledge that urban dwellers face a particular kind of stress, the house specialty is the Moment of Pause, for guests looking to take a little time for themselves.</p><h2>Massachusetts: Mirbeau Spa, Plymouth</h2><p>Situated in the same place that the Mayflower famously landed in the 1600s, the Mirbeau is located in a stately old French mansion not far from the ocean. The property is idyllic and the in-house spa falls in line with its locale, with fireplaces and heated foot pools inside to warm guests up on blustery Massachusetts days. Day spa packages include a voucher to enjoy lunch in the hotel’s restaurant.</p><h2>Michigan: Inn at Bay Harbor, Petoskey</h2><p>With treatment names like Northern Luxury, this lakeside resort spa is very clear that it’s all about a slice of the good life on wild Lake Michigan. Outside, guests will find the excitement of a world-class golf course and plenty of water sports, but inside this well-appointed spa is all about tranquility and self-care. You can even order an afternoon tea service directly to the spa for the ultimate extravagance.</p><h2>Minnesota: Laka Spa, Wayzata</h2><p>Nordic treatments are the name of the game at this cheery spa at Lake Minnetonka’s Hotel Landing. They are all about purity and freshness and the concept is meant to reference the natural waters of the lake itself. Think body treatments that utilize Nordic herbs, river rock massages, and an Arctic scrub that uses wild rice buffing grains, as well as hydro-therapy bath cures that are integral to Nordic spa culture.</p><h2>Mississippi: The Alluvian Spa, Greenwood</h2><p>The Mississippi Delta provides a dramatic backdrop for a premium spa experience in the friendly Alluvian Hotel. This crisp and polished spa is known for its top-notch professional service and soothing therapeutic baths. Luxe facials, massages, and body treatments make up the bulk of the service menu, with a sweet tea skin renewal for a little bit of playful Southern flair.</p><h2>Missouri: Cedar Creek Spa, Ridgedale</h2><p>Rustic and regal come together at the official spa of Big Cedar Lodge in the Ozarks. The star of the Cedar Creek Spa is its stunning grotto pool, with crystal blue waters surrounded by natural stone walls. Guests can pair the warm pool with a bracing cold ice room and also use the spa’s saunas and steam rooms when they book a massage or facial. Treatment options include Swedish massages, organic facials, and professional nail treatments.</p><h2>Montana: Granite Spa, Philipsburg</h2><p>The Ranch at Rock Creek is an unimaginably beautiful Montana guest ranch and its Granite Spa is one of the most impressive features of the entire property. The immense land surrounding the ranch provides opportunities for the Japanese practice of forest bathing and plenty of places to take a soak. Western spa specialties like CBD massages and creekside wagon massages are all delivered at this Montana countryside gem.</p><h2>Nebraska: The Spa at Lied Lodge, Nebraska City</h2><p>Lied Lodge is part of Arbor Day Farm, an expansive swath of land in Nebraska best known as the birthplace of Arbor Day. The farm’s Lied Lodge is where visitors will find the spa, which is a quiet venue that builds relaxation out of a sense of simplicity. The Lodge’s signature services include an apple blossom aromatherapy massage and foot exfoliation and a special body treatment that involves a massage using heated lava shells. After a treatment, guests can explore the rest of the farm.</p><figure><img title="Nebraska: The Spa at Lied Lodge, Nebraska City" src="IMG/AAN1sx0_nebraska_the_spa_at_lied_lodge_nebraska_city.jpg" alt="Nebraska: The Spa at Lied Lodge, Nebraska City"><figcaption><em>Nebraska: The Spa at Lied Lodge, Nebraska City. Lied Lodge/Facebook</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Nevada: Spa at Encore, Las Vegas</h2><p>Las Vegas has more than its fair share of ultra-opulent spas – there’s a fantastic one at almost every hotel on the strip. One of the most extraordinary is the spa at Encore Hotel, which is bigger than the spa at its sister property, The Wynn. Dripping with gold accents and calming Buddha statues, it’s over-the-top without being unacceptably tacky. Since there’s so much world-class spa competition on the strip, the treatments are all of the highest quality.</p><h2>New Hampshire: The Spa at Omni Mount Washington, Bretton Woods</h2><p>Aprés ski often means a massage or a soak in a hot pool, which is why ski areas like New Hampshire’s Bretton Woods have such a good game. The spa at Omni Mount Washington features classic décor for a refined mountain experience and offers an array of extravagant body treatments and skin care rituals. The signature treatments use the spa’s custom Mountain Mist products, made with New England botanicals and formulated to soothe sore muscles.</p><figure><img title="New Hampshire: The Spa at Omni Mount Washington, Bretton Woods" src="IMG/AAN1m9y_new_hampshire_the_spa_at_omni_mount_washington_bretton_woods.jpg" alt="New Hampshire: The Spa at Omni Mount Washington, Bretton Woods"><figcaption><em>New Hampshire: The Spa at Omni Mount Washington, Bretton Woods. Omni Mount Washington Resort/Facebook</em></figcaption></figure><h2>New Jersey: SoJo Spa Club, Edgewater</h2><p>This ingeniously designed multi-level spa has it all: a fitness center, massage services, volcanic sand baths, an ice room, lounges, an infinity pool, and a rooftop garden, all packed into an architecturally interesting tiered building. Particularly spectacular are the Korean-style bathhouses, which are segregated for men and women. Korean body scrubs are also available, along with Japanese sand baths, for a uniquely Asian-influenced experience.</p><h2>New Mexico: Ojo Santa Fe Spa, Santa Fe</h2><p>The Southwest is a hub of desert-themed wellness retreats and this gorgeous Santa Fe spa offers a mix of classic New Mexico design and adjacent natural beauty. The natural healing waters have drawn travelers to bathe in the area for hundreds of years and modern spa visitors can soak in thermal or saltwater pools, with day passes available. The soaks pair well with a signature spa experience, like a cactus flower massage or an ancient energy healing treatment.</p><h2>New York: Aire Ancient Baths, New York City</h2><p>A city like New York is full of spectacular spas, but this bathhouse is one of the most uniquely beautiful. Time-tested spa treatments like Himalayan salt scrubs, holistic detox rituals, and argan oil massages are house specialties, but the main attraction is the Roman-style thermal baths, which are included in all of the signature packages. Dark and decorated to look old but not cartoonish, the bath experience is both novel and invigorating.</p><h2>North Carolina: Omni Grove Park Inn, Asheville</h2><p>Those looking for a spa near the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains will find it at the dashing Omni Grove Park Inn in Asheville. This subterranean spa is special because of its whopping 20 water features, including rock-encrusted mineral pools, waterfalls, and bracing hot/cold contrast pools. Massages, facials, and other treatments are also available when guests aren’t immersed in the pools.</p><h2>North Dakota: Salt Cave Wellness Relaxation Center, Bismarck</h2><p>Salt caves are a popular phenomenon throughout the United States and this one in North Dakota is (literally) a glowing example of this style of spa. Customers get to relax on zero-gravity chairs in a dimly lit cave filled with Himalayan crystal salt. The visual effect is mesmerizing and the quiet environment, lighting, and unique properties of the salt have an incredibly calming effect. This North Dakota spa also offers a far-infrared sauna plus flotation and red-light therapy.</p><h2>Ohio: Inn and Spa at Cedar Falls, Logan</h2><p>The woodlands surrounding this sweet bed and breakfast in the Hocking Hills area are a breath of fresh air, quite literally, making its on-site spa a true respite from busy day-to-day life. Homey and intimate, the spa’s peaceful environment sets guests up for half-day packages that include massages, mud wraps, facials, and other services. The Inn also specializes in other wellness treatments like cupping, reflexology, and ion foot baths.</p><h2>Oklahoma: Udånder, Oklahoma City</h2><p>A modern Scandinavian-style spa, Udånder is so popular in OKC that it now has two locations. The modern lines and cool European styling make this spa a treat to look at, but the smooth simplicity also leads guests into the right frame of mind before stepping into the traditional (and private) sauna or aromatherapy steam room. The treatment menu is as simple as the décor, with solid massages and facials on offer.</p><h2>Oregon: Shibui Spa, Sisters</h2><p>The rustic-chic cabins at FivePine Lodge in central Oregon don’t really jibe with the lavish Asian-style luxury of its onsite spa, which is part of what makes Shibui such an exciting discovery. An oasis filled with spiritual statues, healing waters, and cozy places to lounge, Shibui feels like it’s a world away from the nearby cities of Bend and Redmond. Shibui’s best treatments match its aesthetic, with choices like an abhyanga massage, Himalayan salt scrubs, and hemp-infused facials.</p><h2>Pennsylvania: The Lodge at Woodloch Spa, Hawley</h2><p>The Lodge at Woodloch is a highly-rated destination spa and retreat, but there’s a day spa option for those who can’t swing a multi-day spa extravaganza. Day guests can book things like hydra facials, herbal massages, Thai bodywork, float therapy, or dozens of other treatments. While there, day guests can bask in the rural luxury of the site, enjoying the pools, steam room, and hydromassage water walls for an hour on either end of their appointment.</p><h2>Rhode Island: Spa Fjör, Newport</h2><p>Hotel Viking’s Spa Fjör is suitably Norse-themed, with a white and navy color scheme that looks fresh and clean while still being warm and inviting. Even with the Norse theme, there is a global flavor to the treatments offered, with special services like a Javanese body ritual, Balinese earth clay massage, and a Bourbon body scrub. Water therapy is also a priority here, with a variety of bath rituals that can be added to any massage.</p><h2>South Carolina: The Spa at Hotel Bennett, Charleston</h2><p>A whimsically elegant hotel known for its grandeur and impeccable design isn’t complete without an equally appealing spa. Every detail at The Spa at Hotel Bennett evokes a sense of style and serenity – the spa isn’t huge, but it’s appropriately intimate for its boutique setting. The treatment menu offers the standard mix of massages, facials, and body treatments, but each one has a special twist to take the luxury quotient to the next level.</p><h2>South Dakota: Akela Spa of Deadwood, Sturgis</h2><p>Not many spas in the US feature a teepee that doubles as a dry sauna, massages that employ cedar, and other ingredients used in Lakota healing or wild sage body scrubs. Akela is located in South Dakota’s Black Hills, a part of the state with a significant Indigenous population, and that culture influences this distinctive spa. The highlight is the Akela Garden, an outdoor area with a teepee sauna as well as an infrared sauna, a steam room, hot tubs, and a fire pit lounge.</p><h2>Tennessee: Serenity Spa, Gatlinburg</h2><p>Serenity Spa is part of the Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort complex, which is in a particularly breathtaking part of Tennessee but is also known for its very non-serene waterpark. This tucked-away spa is a perfect escape for a parent who needs a little “me time” while the rest of the family splash at the park. The cozy and professional spa offers more than 50 different services, including curated packages for guests who need a couple of hours of hardcore pampering.</p><h2>Texas: Lake Austin Spa Resort, Austin</h2><p>This spa has reached the number one spot on Conde Nast Traveler’s list of North America destination spas because of its enviable location on Lake Austin, unpretentious vibes, and sheer dedication to comfort and service. The look is high-end but homey, with treatments that focus on health and rejuvenation. Customers can choose integrative wellness services that help with emotional well-being, Eastern-style massages, ginger body treatments, aquatic stretching sessions, and much more.</p><h2>Utah: The Grand Spa, Salt Lake City</h2><p>Salt Lake City and the state of Utah may not be known for their ostentatious shows of grandeur, but The Grand American Hotel and its spa earn their lofty name. Personalized care is the selling point here, with facials and massages that can be tailored to individual needs. This refined space is the perfect place to wind down, with lots of cushy spots to sit, and regally designed treatment rooms. Pool and wellness facility access is also available to day spa guests for an additional fee.</p><h2>Vermont: Woodstock Inn Spa, Woodstock</h2><p>The natural light, vaulted ceilings, and views of surrounding greenery at this contemporary spa in Vermont are a nice alternative to the dark and cavern-like décor of many spas in America. While the host resort is also worth a stay, those just out for the day can book a deep tissue massage or a seasonal-inspired multi-layered body treatment or go for the 100-minute “signature experience,” which includes a trip to the Aroma Design Bar for customized products.</p><figure><img title="Vermont: Woodstock Inn Spa, Woodstock" src="IMG/AAN1kgf_vermont_woodstock_inn_spa_woodstock.jpg" alt="Vermont: Woodstock Inn Spa, Woodstock"><figcaption><em>Vermont: Woodstock Inn Spa, Woodstock. Woodstock Inn & Resort/Facebook</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Virginia: Salamander Resort and Spa, Middleburg</h2><p>Usually used as a retreat for weary bodies driving in from Washington DC, the Salamander’s services lean into the realm of holistic health, with treatments including calming hydration rituals, CBD massages, and vitamin C citrus body wraps. Visually, the spa is a sumptuous facility, with lots of lavish stonework, private terraces, and outdoor pools that show off the Virginia countryside.</p><h2>Washington: Salish Lodge and Spa, Snoqualmie</h2><p>No spa can rival the rugged beauty of the Pacific Northwest, which is why this lodge, just a half hour from Seattle, incorporates the outdoors into its design. There are plenty of windows so guests can enjoy both sunlight and greenery in between treatments or from the pools. Spa technicians are trained in specialty techniques like ashiatsu (which is performed with the feet), Thai massage, and the Polynesian lomilomi method.</p><h2>West Virginia: The Greenbrier, White Sulphur Springs</h2><p>The Greenbrier has the distinction of being one of America’s oldest spas – settlers have been visiting the healing waters since 1778, with Indigenous peoples using them for much longer. The current Greenbrier went up in 1813, and the grand complex is home to a suitably beautiful spa. The spa’s showcase service is The Greenbrier Treatment, which involves a soak in White Sulphur Springs, a Swiss shower, and a Swedish massage.</p><h2>Wisconsin: Kohler Waters Spa, Kohler</h2><p>There are multiple Kohler Waters locations, but the flagship is at the American Club Resort Hotel. The mineral-rich water in the area has been used for spa purposes since 1883 and the design of the current spa highlights those fresh and healing properties. The spa’s Kohler Vichy shower and bathing services are a key draw, with additional hydrotherapy treatments, massages, facials, and wraps also available.</p><h2>Wyoming: Chill Spa, Teton Village</h2><p>Teton Village essentially serves visitors to Jackson Hole’s ski resorts and all of those outdoor enthusiasts need some spa action to soothe their post-slopes bodies. The Chill Spa overlooks the mountain village but also has plenty of private space to get away from the hustle and bustle. To complement the natural wonder outside, the spa uses all-natural organic products in its many varieties of massages and facials.</p></main>
