It presents with symptoms like sudden severe attacks of joint pain and swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often great toe. It is so severe that it might wake you in the night. Uric acid in our body is produced when purines are broken down in our body. Purines are also found in red meat, organ meats like liver, seafood like tuna, scallops, mussels. Beer and sweetened fruit sugar (fructose) are known to increase uric acid levels. Certain diseases and medications like thiazide diuretics increase uric acid levels. Usually, excess uric acid is dissolved in blood removed through the kidneys. But in Gout uric acid is either not removed by the kidneys or excess uric acid is produced. This forms shard needle-like crystals in the joints, leading to pain, swelling, and inflammation. The most misunderstood thing about gout is that hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid levels in the blood) does not always cause gout.</p><p><p>→ <b>Learn more about gout: See the causes, symptoms, treatment options and more.</b></p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to gout.</b></p><h2>Expert opinion from Marcelle Freire</h2><h5>Doctor of Medicine · 3 years of experience · Brazil</h5><p>Gouty arthritis, or simply gout, is a crystal deposition arthropathy, that is, a type of arthritis secondary to the accumulation of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. Patients with gout usually have high concentrations of uric acid in the blood, but gouty arthritis does not occur only because of this increase, but when this uric acid is deposited in the form of crystals in the joints. Many patients, however, do not understand that gout is not just an increase in uric acid in the blood, but a complex disease in which metabolism, genetic factors and lifestyle interact so that this excess uric acid is deposited in the form of crystals in the joints. That's why some precipitating factors can trigger crises and also why not every patient who has high uric acid will necessarily develop gout.</p><p><p>→ <b>Learn more about gout: See the causes, symptoms, treatment options and more.</b></p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to gout.</b></p><h2>Expert opinion from Gustavo Campos</h2><h5>Doctor of Medicine · 9 years of experience · Brazil</h5><p>The most common misconception about gout is that it only affects the big toe. People may be unaware that, while the big toe is the most commonly involved site, other locations such as the instep, ankle, wrist, fingers, and knees can also be affected.</p><p><table><tr><th>What are people curious about?</th></tr><tr><td>Gout</td><td>Alzheimer's association</td></tr><tr><td>Shingles rash</td><td>Glucagon-like peptide 1</td></tr></table></main>
