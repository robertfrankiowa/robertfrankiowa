    <main><h1>Diet vs. Exercise</h1><p>So long as weight loss remains a goal, the question of how to achieve it will be asked. The answers will inevitably involve both diet and exercise. But which is more important? When it comes to the research, there’s really no question that a dynamic relationship exists between the two. I offer up the metaphor of the dial and the light switch. The relationship between diet and exercise is more like two dials with which you can adjust the brightness of lights in the same room. You’ll slide them to different degrees to meet your own needs and achieve the desired balance. It’s not like a light switch, which is either on or off.</p><p>But every person has a different body, age, and stage of life. Each individual has a different set of goals, so how you adjust your own dials will vary accordingly. As a rule, you should consult a medical professional such as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) or doctor before considering a major initiative like weight loss. Most cardio fans are familiar with the benefits offered by way of a home treadmill, but they’ve probably learned the hard way that it’s impossible to run off a bad diet. Meanwhile, as reported by the American Council on Exercise, only about 5% of dieters are able to keep the weight they’ve lost off without exercise, with about 33% of the pounds regained in a year, and nearly 100% within three to five years. Consider that both are equally important on the whole, but which one matters to your goals will vary with the individual.</p><figure><img title="Provided by TreadmillReviews" src="IMG/AA1gG9yC_diet_vs_exercise.jpg" alt="Diet vs. Exercise"><figcaption><em>Diet vs. Exercise.

Shutterstock.com</p><h2>What the Research Says</h2><p>Just to prove the point that you really can’t separate nutrition from exercise in a weight-loss program, consider the following research below.</p><ul>   <li>Diet or Exercise Interventions vs Combined Behavioral Weight Management Programs: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Direct Comparisons: Published in the <em>Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</em>, this study includes eight randomized controlled trials with 1,022 participants where behavioral weight management programs (BWMPs) were directly compared with diet-only and exercise-only programs. The BWMPs used a combination of both diet and exercise. The authors reported that the weakest performing weight loss strategy was exercise-alone. Meanwhile, similar weight loss results were achieved in the short-term between BWMP and diet-only, but the combined approach of BWMP won out in terms of long-term weight loss and maintenance.</li>   <li>Effects of Exercise Alone or in Combination With High-Protein Diet on Muscle Function, Aerobic Capacity, and Physical Function in Middle-Aged Obese Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial:  Published in the <em>Journal of Journal of Nutrition, Health, and Aging</em>, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) matched up 69 middle-aged adults with obesity and randomly assigned them to either an exercise-only group, an exercise-plus-high-protein-diet group, or a control which maintained their normal lifestyle. Both intervention groups participated for 12 weeks with pre- and post-testing for maximal exercise capacity, muscle function, and functional physical performance. After 12 weeks, both intervention groups outperformed the control group, but the exercise-plus-high-protein-diet group outperformed the exercise-only group in terms of anaerobic performance, the sit-to-stand test, and stair climbing. The study suggests that for middle-aged adults with obesity, the exercise combined with a high-protein diet not only improved muscle power and exercise capacity but enhanced their physical performance as well.</li>   <li>Effect of a Combination of Aerobic Exercise and Dietary Modification on Liver Function in Overweight and Obese Men:  Published in the <em>Journal of Men’s Health</em>, this study assesses the impact of a combined dietary modification and aerobic exercise on liver function in adults with obesity and overweight. Pre- and post-tests were administered to the participants who were randomly assigned to one of two groups, the first of which combined a prepared diet with 12 weeks of aerobic exercise classes, and the second of which followed their normal lifestyles. After the 12-week intervention, the participants in the diet/exercise group averaged a weight loss of 10.6%, as well as reduced body mass index by 10.2%, waist circumference by 9.4%, and fat percentage by 14.5%. Overall liver function also improved in the intervention group relative to the control.</li>  </ul><p>The list could go on and on. There’s no question that a combined approach to weight loss works best and exercise alone won’t do the trick. Consider that a large pizza, or six to eight slices, could contain more than 1,200 calories. There are about 240 calories in a 20-ounce bottle of cola. Let’s face it, six to eight slices of pizza and a bottle of pop don’t strike the average person as excessive. That might be a normal Friday night. A 200-pound person would have to jog on a treadmill for about two hours to burn off those 1,440 calories alone. If you’re eating that way throughout the day, you’ll see why it’s just downright impossible to run off a bad diet.</p><h2>What Kind of Diet Should Be Used?</h2><p>The question of what type of diet should be used to lose weight is so individualized, I highly recommend consulting an RDN or medical doctor if your health is involved. There’s a huge difference between losing weight for a bodybuilding show and dealing with Type 2 diabetes. Most experts will tell you it’s possible to safely lose between one and two pounds per week, but up to what point? If you’re considering a 100-plus pound weight loss, you’ll certainly want to pace yourself differently than if preparing for a vacation at the beach. If shopping for a treadmill to be used as part of a weight loss program, check out the Five Step Treadmill Buying Guide here, and keep your health goals in mind. A number of great apps are available, such as the iFit program, which include a nutrition component as well as heartrate monitoring.</p><p>Good rules of thumb include limiting the number of sugar-sweetened beverages and increasing portions of fruits and vegetables. There’s no question that a successful weight loss program will include both diet and exercise, and doing one without the other won’t work out in the long run. So reading up on nutrition while jogging on the treadmill would be a worthwhile investment of your time.</p></main>
