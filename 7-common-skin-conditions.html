    <main><h1>7 common skin conditions</h1><h2>Warts and moles</h2><p>                     Warts are benign (noncancerous) growths on the skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), according to the AAD. They often occur on the hands and on the soles of the feet. Sometimes, tiny black dots will be visible in a wart.                   </p><p>                     "These are blocked blood vessels, which are a common occurrence with a papilloma viral infection," said Dr. Charles Crutchfield, a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Minnesota Medical School and medical director of Crutchfield Dermatology. The best treatment for warts is to cause a mild irritation of these skin growths — usually by freezing them, applying a chemical such as salicylic acid, or using lasers — so the immune system can recognize the viral infection and get rid of it.                    </p><p>                     Moles are another type of common growth on the skin. They're most often brown or black, but some can be red or other colors, and they may appear flat or raised. If a mole starts changing in size, color or shape, or if it bleeds and doesn't heal on its own within three weeks, it should be evaluated to make sure it's not turning into skin cancer, Crutchfield said.                   </p><h2>Acne</h2><p>                     Acne, a disorder of the hair and oil glands, is among the most common skin conditions treated by dermatologists, Crutchfield told Live Science.                   </p><p>                     Acne occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. The condition presents itself as red bumps and pimples on the face, chest and back, Crutchfield said. Treatments for acne include vitamin A products, such as retinols, which prevent the plugging of hair follicles and improves skin texture; salicylic acid, to unplug pores; benzoyl peroxides, to kill acne-causing bacteria; and antibiotics, to kill bacteria and reduce inflammation.                   </p><figure><img title="Acne" src="IMG/AA1m4Fp3_acne.jpg" alt="Acne"><figcaption><em>Acne.

On lighter skin, it looks like patches of red, itchy, bumpy skin; on darker skin tones, these patches may appear darker brown, purple or ashen grey, according to the National Eczema Association. The condition can occur anywhere on the skin. Sometimes, it flares up on its own; other times, it is caused by a specific trigger, such as a skin irritant like poison ivy, or exposure to an allergen, Crutchfield said.                   </p><p>                     Around 31.6 million people in the U.S. have some form of eczema, per the National Eczema Association.                   </p><p>                     While the exact cause of eczema is unknown, it often runs in families and occurs alongside asthma and hay fever. Eczema is best treated with topical moisturizers, anti-inflammatory creams and mild steroid ointments, Dr. Ross Perry, aesthetic doctor and medical director at Cosmedics Skin Clinics in England, told Live Science.                   </p><figure><img title="Eczema" src="IMG/AA1m4tC2_eczema.jpg" alt="Eczema"><figcaption><em>Eczema.

In people with darker skin, the redness often associated with rosacea may be less obvious, but other symptoms, such as swelling, bumpiness and brown discoloration of the skin, may still appear, according to the AAD.                    </p><p>                     Symptoms often get worse with stress and excessive alcohol consumption, Perry said.                    </p><p>                     Rosacea affects around 16 million Americans, according to the AAD. Although the symptoms of this condition are mostly cosmetic, rosacea can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life and self-esteem. The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, but studies suggest that some people may be more genetically predisposed to this condition than others, according to a 2021 review published in the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology.                     </p><p>                     Treatments for rosacea generally involve using topical creams that temporarily shrink the blood vessels underneath the skin. Sometimes, laser treatments are used, as they can help to reduce the redness, Perry said.                   </p><figure><img title="Rosacea" src="IMG/AA1m4Fp5_rosacea.jpg" alt="Rosacea"><figcaption><em>Rosacea.

The condition often runs in families and, in people with lighter skin tones, presents as red, scaly plaques or red areas of skin, most notably on the elbows and/or knees, around the scalp hairline, and on the front of the chest, Perry told Live Science. In people with darker skin tones, the plaques may appear pink, violet or dark brown, the AAD notes.                   </p><p>                     The exact cause of psoriasis is not fully understood, but symptoms tend to flare and fluctuate over time. The condition often worsens due to stress, infections, skin injury, heavy alcohol consumption, and cold, dry weather, according to the AAD.                    </p><p>                     Around 7.5 million people have psoriasis in the U.S., according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. Treatment for psoriasis often involves steroid-based topical creams, vitamin D creams and specialized sunbeds that help reduce the flare and irritation of psoriasis, Perry said.                   </p><figure><img title="Psoriasis" src="IMG/AA1m4JZz_psoriasis.jpg" alt="Psoriasis"><figcaption><em>Psoriasis.

It is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.                    </p><p>                     People who recover from chickenpox carry VZV for the rest of their lives. The virus lies latent in cells of the nervous system but can sometimes reactivate, and this reactivation causes shingles. Older adults with weakened immune systems are at particularly high risk of developing the condition, according to the AAD. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults ages 50 and older get two doses of the shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and notes that adults as young as 19 years old should also consider the vaccine if they have weakened immune systems.                     </p><p>                     Shingles is usually treated with antiviral medications such as acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir, and over-the-counter pain relievers, per the AAD.                   </p><h2>Skin cancer</h2><p>                     Skin cancer is an uncontrolled and abnormal growth of skin cells. The most common type of skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma, Crutchfield said. Around 3.6 million cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the United States each year, according to the SCF. This type of cancer is typically pink, red or pearly white, but in patients with darker skin, about half of basal cell carcinomas may be brown in color. It usually appears on sun-exposed areas of the face, ears or neck.                   </p><p>                     Basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads to other parts of the body, but it can be very problematic if it's not treated, Crutchfield cautioned. Cancerous tissues can grow wide and deep into the skin and destroy skin, tissue and bone, according to the SCF.                   </p><p>                     The second most common type of skin cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. It may appear as a brown or red spot; a rough, scaly patch; or a sore that won't heal, according to the AAD. Squamous cell carcinoma is highly treatable in the early stages. However, it may spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.                   </p><p>                     The most serious form of skin cancer is melanoma, Crutchfield said. This cancer begins in the skin's pigment-producing cells, the melanocytes. Although it is the rarest form of skin cancer, melanoma is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths, as it is more likely to spread to other parts of the body than other types of skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.                   </p><p>                     <em>This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.</em>                   </p></main>
