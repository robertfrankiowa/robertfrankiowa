The seeds can be pickled, creating a delicacy resembling capers, and the leaves can be fried like spinach. Nasturtium, the plant in question, has an incredibly wide variety of uses in the kitchen. Among its properties, experts mention its impact on weight loss.</p></strong><p>Ewa Kozioł, a certified herbalist and advocate of a healthy lifestyle, mentioned on her social media that nasturtium is the best herb for weight loss. Ewa Kozioł, who operates in the media as a blogger ("Zielony Zagonek"), also publishes content on social media channels. In one of them, she discussed nasturtium's influence on weight loss.</p><h2>nasturtium for weight loss</h2><p>Herbalist Ewa Kozioł reveals that nasturtium is extremely helpful in the fight against overweight. Both its leaves and flowers are rich in components that aid the weight loss process. <strong>As she points out, water extracts from dried leaves and flowers of this plant have a positive effect on our digestive system. </strong>Furthermore, nasturtium helps regulate bowel movements, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy metabolism. Additionally, this plant prevents the formation of gallstones. Moreover, nasturtium can ease the feeling of heaviness that often accompanies a hearty meal.</p><p>Nasturtium is rich in glucosinolates, which are organic sulfur compounds. <strong>These compounds can stimulate digestion, which accelerates metabolism. </strong>But that's not all—glucosinolates also have antibacterial and antiviral properties. As a result, they can help combat infections of the urinary tract, throat, lungs, and skin. Nasturtium also contains compounds that have the potential to lower levels of so-called bad cholesterol (LDL) in the blood. This, in turn, can contribute to maintaining heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p><figure><img title="Canva, BasieB" src="IMG/BB1oQX6M_nasturtium_is_a_beautiful_edible_flower_with_slimming_properties.jpg" alt="Nasturtium is a beautiful edible flower with slimming properties."><figcaption><em>Nasturtium is a beautiful edible flower with slimming properties..

Cover the infusion and let it sit for about 15 minutes to allow the active ingredients to release. Once the infusion cools down, you can sweeten it with honey to taste.</p><p><b>Read also:</b></p><p>Brewing the perfect herbal tea: Tips you need to know</p><h2>Using nasturtium in the kitchen</h2><p>Nasturtium typically blooms from June to September, and its flowers are edible with a slightly spicy taste.
