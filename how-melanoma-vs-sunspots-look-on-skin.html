Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><strong>Medically reviewed by William Truswell, MD</strong><p>If you develop a spot on your skin, you might wonder if it is melanoma or just a normal sign of aging.</p><p>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It is characterized by moles that increase in size, change in appearance, have irregular borders, are asymmetrical, or are uneven in color. Melanomas can develop anywhere on the body.</p><p>By contrast, sunspots, also known as age spots or liver spots, are typically harmless. They appear as light brown to black lesions that are flat and oval in size. Sunspots usually develop on areas of the skin that are chronically exposed to the sun, such as the hands, face, shoulders, upper back, or tops of the feet. </p><p>While sunspots are often mistaken for melanomas and vice versa, some features set these lesions apart. This article will explain how to tell the difference between melanomas and sunspots, how to protect yourself from developing these spots, and when you should see a medical provider.</p><h2>Melanoma (Skin Cancer) vs. Sunspots on Skin</h2><p>When determining the difference between melanomas and sunspots, it’s helpful to reference the “ABCDE” mnemonic  guide to melanoma. This tool describes the classic characteristics of melanoma skin cancers, which include:</p><ul><li><strong>A</strong>symmetry: The shape of one half of the mole doesn’t match the other.</li><li><strong>B</strong>order: The edges of melanomas are frequently irregular, ragged, or blurred.</li><li><strong>C</strong>olor: The color is often uneven and may appear in shades of black, brown, or tan. You may also notice areas of gray, red, white, pink, or blue in a melanoma lesion.</li><li><strong>D</strong>iameter: Typically, melanomas increase in size.</li><li><strong>E</strong>volution: The moles evolve, or change, over time.</li></ul><p>Melanomas can develop from an existing mole but may also appear as a new mole. Sometimes, the lesions are painful, itchy, or tender.  They are often, but not always, raised and can be hard and lumpy.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1fmmmp_melanoma_with_color_variation.jpg" alt="Melanoma with color variation"><figcaption><em>Reproduced with permission from Â© DermNet and Â© Waikato District Health Board www.dermnetnz.org 2023..

Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><p><h3>Other Skin Lesions That Look Like Sunspots</h3><p>Skin lesions that may be mistaken for sunspots include:</p><ul><li>Freckles</li><li>Cherry angiomas</li><li>Skin tags</li><li>Moles</li><li>Birth marks</li></ul><p> <h2>Do Sunspots Turn Into Melanoma?</h2><p>Sunspots aren’t typically thought to be harmful to your health. They don’t develop into cancer, though melanomas and sunspots can occur on the same area of the skin. Sunspots are often difficult to tell apart from skin cancers.</p><p>Additionally, some studies have suggested that age spots are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer, though the mechanism isn’t understood. One theory is that people with sunspots are more likely to have sun damage, which also puts them at risk for melanoma.</p><h2>How Quickly Does Melanoma Form?</h2><p>Certain types of melanoma grow more quickly than others. If untreated, some melanomas can become life-threatening in a matter of weeks. The chances of curing melanoma drop significantly if the cancer spreads to other areas of the body. Diagnosing and treating melanoma promptly is important for a favorable outlook.</p><h2>Sunspots: Screening, Removal, and Sun Protection</h2><p>While sunspots are usually nothing to worry about, it’s a good idea to see your healthcare provider any time you develop a new lesion on your body. Additionally, you should seek medical care if your age spots change in appearance.</p><p>Some people want to get rid of their sunspots because they are cosmetically unappealing. Treatments for sunspots may include:</p><ul><li>Bleaching creams or lotions</li><li>Freezing (cryotherapy)</li><li>Laser treatments</li><li>Intense pulsed light</li><li>Chemical peels</li><li>Microdermabrasion</li></ul><p>You can protect your skin from the sun and help prevent sunspots from forming by:</p><ul><li>Avoiding sun exposure at midday</li><li>Wearing protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, hats, and pants when outdoors</li><li>Applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of at least 30</li></ul><p><h3>Natural Remedies for Sunspots</h3><p>Although they are not always proven to work, some people try natural approaches to remove their sunspots, such as applying lemon, apple cider vinegar, aloe vera, or even onions to the lesion. You should talk to your healthcare provider before attempting to use any of these remedies.</p><p> <h2>Melanoma: Screening, Treatment, and Sun Protection </h2><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) doesn’t take a side for or against routine screenings to detect skin cancers early. However, people who have a history of skin cancer, are at high risk for skin cancer, or develop new skin lesions are encouraged to see their healthcare providers regularly for a full-body skin exam.</p><p>Dermatologists also advise that all people conduct regular self-exams to check for any skin changes, including new moles or lesions.</p><p>Treatments for melanoma will depend on how advanced it is. Some options include:</p><ul><li>Surgery: Removal of the tumor</li><li>Chemotherapy: Using drugs that target fast-growing cells</li><li>Radiation therapy: Using high energy particles to destroy tumor cells</li><li>Immunotherapy: Using treatments based on the immune system to help the body detect and fight the cancer</li><li>Targeted therapy: Using drugs that are effective against certain tumor cell characteristics</li></ul><p>You can help prevent melanoma by practicing the same sun safety habits that protect against sunspots. These include avoiding the sun at midday, wearing protective clothing, and applying sunscreen when outdoors. It’s also important to avoid tanning devices and sun lamps, as exposure to them can increase the risk of developing this type of skin cancer.</p><p><p>Some risk factors for melanoma include:</p><ul><li>Being exposed to excessive ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun or indoor tanning</li><li>Having a weakened immune system</li><li>Having many moles</li><li>Having fair skin, light eyes, and light or red hair</li><li>Having a history of skin cancer</li><li>Having a family history of melanoma</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Sunspots and melanomas are two very different skin issues that require different treatments. However, it’s often difficult to tell them apart. One key distinction is that sunspots form on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, while melanomas can develop anywhere on the body.</p><p>Because it often takes a trained eye to distinguish between a sunspot and a melanoma lesion, you should see your healthcare provider anytime you notice a new spot on your skin.</p></main>
