    <main><h1>Easy hack to get rid of migraines has 'zero side effects', says doctor</h1><p><strong>Migraines are one of the most common and inconvenient health conditions. People who often experience headaches rely on medications for instant relief. But there seems to be a hack to solve the problem, without any side effects. </strong></p><p>Headaches can be the outcome of several things. It could be caused due to stress, hormonal imbalance, diet, lifestyle, and other factors. Bouts of migraines can cause major hindrance, and in some instances, they can be crippling.</p><h2>Easy home remedy to get rid of migraines </h2><p>The said method has prompted reactions from several doctors on TikTok as it’s very convenient to try, doesn’t have any side effects and, many have claimed it to be effective.</p><p>If you’re suffering from excruciating headaches as a victim of migraines, the viral hack suggests soaking your feet in hot water. You can simply fill a large bowl with hot water and stand it in or dip your legs in a bathtub with hot water too.</p><p>Dr. Sood claims in one of his videos that the popular method to get rid of headaches instantly has “zero side effects.” As for the logic that drives it, the doctor says that “soaking your legs in hot water will dilate the blood vessels in your feet pulling blood away from your head.” This will ease the pressure on the blood vessels causing your migraine, thus reducing the pain and giving you instant relief.</p><p>・<strong>WORDS OF WISDOM:</strong> 103-year-old doctor shares her 5 secrets to living longer and happier</p><p>Migraines are caused due to unusual brain activities involving nerve pathways and chemicals. This can cause a change in the blood flow in the brain and surrounding tissues.</p><h2>Other explanations for the hack to possibly work </h2><p>Other than the reason explained in the TikTok video, ER doctor Joe Whittington has more reasons why the hack may work on some, even though there is no evidence that it has a similar effect on everyone.</p><p>Other than dilating the blood muscles, hot water can also relax your muscles and relieve tension, says the doctor. This naturally reduces the intensity of the pain in your head. The doctor further explains that hot water is also known to modulate the “body’s perception of pain”.</p><p>The fourth reason could be a placebo effect – you believe you’re doing something to the headache by soaking your feet in hot water, so the pain goes away naturally.</p><p>We advise seeing a doctor upon experiencing any discomfort or pain in the head as it can be caused due to underlying or undiagnosed health conditions.</p><p>Dr. Joe Whittington is a certified ER doctor, best known for his viral content about health and wellness across social media. He’s been out of residency for a while now, using his knowledge of medicine to educate people on the Internet.</p></main>
