    <main><h1>How and When to See a Psychiatrist</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Kathleen Daly, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Kathleen Daly, MD</strong><p>A psychiatrist is a licensed provider and medical doctor (MD) or a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) specializing in mental health conditions. These professionals evaluate and diagnose mental health conditions and treat patients by prescribing medications. The term "psychiatrist" is often confused with "psychologist," but there are important distinctions between the two mental health professionals.</p><p>Psychiatrists are medical doctors who can prescribe medication, whereas psychologists are trained mental health providers who do not hold a medical degree and cannot prescribe medication without additional training.</p><p>This article discusses psychiatrists, the conditions they treat, how to find a psychiatrist, and what to expect during an appointment.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1nxvk7_how_and_when_to_see_a_psychiatrist.jpg" alt="How and When to see a psychiatrist"><figcaption><em>Illustration by Mira Norian for Verywell Health.

The most common mental health disorders are anxiety and depressive disorders. However, psychiatrists are qualified to treat various conditions defined in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</em> (DSM-5). Examples of mental health conditions that psychiatrists treat include:</p><ul><li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li><li>Addiction</li><li>Personality disorders</li><li>Eating disorders</li></ul><p><h3>Psychiatrists vs. Psychologists</h3><p>Psychiatrists are medical doctors who treat the mental and physical symptoms of mental health disorders using medications, psychotherapy, and brain stimulation treatment. Psychologists are mental health providers with an advanced degree, who treat mental health disorders with psychotherapy.</p><p> <h2>When to See a Psychiatrist </h2><p>Anyone with symptoms who suspects a mental health condition or who has a diagnosis but is struggling with their mental health should seek the support of a psychiatrist or another mental health provider. Mental health conditions are treatable, and getting prompt care leads to better outcomes.</p><p>Symptoms of mental health disorders may include:</p><ul><li>Changes in mood</li><li>Decreased desire to participate in activities</li><li>Emotional challenges</li><li>Energy changes</li><li>Headache</li><li>Loss of control</li><li>Physical body pain</li><li>Sleep pattern changes</li><li>Thoughts or feelings that interfere with daily life</li></ul><p><h3>Suicide Prevention Hotline</h3><p>Those experiencing a mental health crisis or having thoughts of suicide should seek emergency care by calling the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or going to the nearest emergency room. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are available at hospitals through emergency departments. After a mental health diagnosis, it is essential to continue to follow up with a psychiatrist or other mental health professional for ongoing care.</p><h2>During a Psychiatric Appointment</h2><p>An appointment with a psychiatrist typically involves a conversation that considers the following:</p><ul><li>Your current symptoms and concerns</li><li>Your medical and mental health histories</li><li>Your family history</li><li>How your symptoms affect your daily life</li></ul><p>Mental health providers such as psychiatrists also use standard questionnaires to evaluate for mental health disorders. For example, the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS) is an effective tool for identifying depression and anxiety. Such evaluation tools may be a form you fill out, or someone may verbally ask you (or a caregiver) questions.</p><h2>How to Find a Psychiatrist </h2><p>Finding a psychiatrist may begin with an appointment with a primary care practitioner. These providers can do an initial evaluation and help to determine if an appointment with a psychiatrist or other mental health provider is warranted. While it can be challenging to find a provider and receive care, virtual appointments and online treatment may be more accessible, and these options are effective in treating mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.</p><p>The process of finding a psychiatrist for mental health concerns may be different for people without insurance vs. those with insurance.</p><h3>Through Insurance</h3><p>Many insurance plans offer mental health coverage, including psychiatric appointments. Additionally, there are laws to promote mental health that help to make mental health services more accessible through insurance. Check with your insurer to determine what services and providers are covered; some insurance companies may require a referral for you to see a psychiatrist. Insurance companies can provide a list of psychiatrists that are in-network and covered by the plan.</p><p>Even when insurance their plans cover mental health services, some people choose to seek care from a psychiatrist or other mental health professional without getting the services covered by insurance. Opting for care outside of what's covered by insurance allows you more freedom to choose a provider. Nearly half of psychiatrists do not accept insurance, resulting in out-of-pocket expenses for the patient.</p><p>Some providers offer services on a sliding scale to accommodate different abilities to pay. If you are considering services without insurance coverage and are concerned about the cost, contact providers for options.</p><h2>Psychiatrist Training and Certification </h2><p>The psychiatrist training and certification process begins with four years of medical school. They then receive specialized training in the mental health field and become licensed to practice. While preparation to become a psychiatrist does involve some training in talk therapy, there is more of a focus on treating with medications. This training differs from psychologists who receive doctorate degrees, do not go to medical school, and focus primarily on talk therapy when treating mental health concerns.</p><p>The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) provides board certification for licensed psychiatrists after they pass an examination and meet all requirements. Continued education is also part of maintaining a license to practice psychiatry and helps improve the quality of care.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Psychiatrists are medical doctors specializing in mental health who evaluate, diagnose, and treat mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Anyone struggling with mental health concerns or experiencing symptoms of a mental health disorder should seek the support of a mental health provider such as a psychiatrist. Finding a psychiatrist may be challenging, but primary care practitioners and insurance providers can help.</p>
