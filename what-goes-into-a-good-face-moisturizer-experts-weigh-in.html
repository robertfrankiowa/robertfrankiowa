    <main><h1>What goes into a good face moisturizer? Experts weigh in</h1><p><em>Shop TODAY independently determines what we cover and recommend. When you buy through our links, we earn a commission. Learn more.</em></p><p>Tweens, teenagers and mature adults are all searching for the perfect products to add to their daily skin care routine. When it comes to finding the best face moisturizer, you'll first want to consider three important factors: skin type, active ingredients in the moisturizer and the season. </p><p>We spoke to board-certified dermatologists for their expert insights as well as included our Shop TODAY Beauty Awards winners, along with a few editor-tested favorites. From CeraVe to Neutrogena, we found the best face moisturizers to help transform your skin into becoming smoother and softer in no time. </p><p><strong>What to look for</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Ingredients are key</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Shop TODAY Beauty Awards winners</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Expert-recommended face moisturizers</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Editor-loved face moisturizers</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>How we chose</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Meet the experts</strong></p><h2><strong>What to look for in a face moisturizer</strong></h2><p>With a plethora of skin care products on the market, it’s often hard to narrow down which is best for you. Dr. Keira Barr, MD, a board-certified dermatologist who’s also the Psychodermatologist in Residence of the Scientific Research Board at selfmade, says that “a good moisturizer hydrates the skin, keeps that moisture in, supports skin barrier function and resilience, and feels soothing when applied.”</p><p>Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rina Weimann also understands that finding the perfect facial moisturizer can be stressful. “If you are looking for a morning or daytime facial moisturizer it is important to incorporate SPF into your moisturizer — even for those who work from home, our electronic devices emit blue light which may contribute to signs of premature skin aging,” says Weimann. </p><p>“Hydration, repairing skin damage and maintaining the protective skin barrier are essential for a daily-use facial moisturizer,” she continues. </p><h2><strong>Ingredients are key</strong></h2><p>You’ll also want to consider the ingredients contained in the facial cleanser when deciding which products to add to your daily skin care routine. Weimann explains that certain ingredients are recommended when it comes to choosing an effective facial moisturizer:</p><ul><li><strong>Hyaluronic acid:</strong> “Hyaluronic acid is a key molecule in skin aging as well as skin hydration, and it helps to retain moisture in the skin,” Weimann tells us.</li><li><strong>Glycerin:</strong> “Glycerin is specific type of moisturizing ingredient called a humectant meaning it helps draw water back into the skin and prevents further water loss,” she continues.</li><li><strong>Ceramides: </strong>“Ceramides are skin lipids that are found in the top layer of the skin, also referred to as the epidermis,” Weimann says. She also mentions that ceramides are “key ingredients for protecting the skin barrier and preventing skin water loss.”</li><li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> “Niacinamide is an effective moisturizing ingredient that works by increasing the production of essential skin proteins (filaggrin) and lipids (ceramide),” Weimann tells us. “These proteins and lipids are key as they are frequently impaired in individuals with dry and/or dehydrated skin and eczema.” </li><li><strong>Shea butter:</strong> “Shea butter derived from the shea tree fruit...has soothing, anti-inflammatory, hydrating as well as antioxidant effects,” she advises.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, it is also important to avoid certain ingredients depending on your skin type, as they can cause acne or irritation, suggests both Weimann and Barr.</p><p>“For those with acne-prone skin, it is important to avoid any heavy oil-based moisturizers and/or thick occlusive ointments as this may clog your pores and lead to acne breakouts. I recommend finding a moisturizer that has a lightweight formula, a buildable texture and indicates on the label that it is noncomedogenic (i.e. won’t clog pores),” suggests Weimann.</p><p>Barr also recommends avoiding moisturizers with too many active ingredients and easing up on topical retinoids that can contribute to irritation and redness. “Alternatives to retinoids that aid in skin cell turnover without the photosensitivity and increased irritation include bakuchiol, which is a naturally derived plant extract,” she says. </p><p>“Other ingredients to avoid include synthetic or highly concentrated fragrances which can trigger skin sensitivity, irritation or a more intense allergy, Barr suggests. </p><h2><strong>Shop TODAY Beauty Awards winners </strong></h2><h3>Say goodbye to wrinkles: The INKEY List Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</h3><p>Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</p><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1o9Kxm_we_tested_over_400_products_during_shop_todays_2024_beauty_awards_here_are_our_favorites_under_25.jpg" alt="We tested over 400 products during Shop TODAY’s 2024 Beauty Awards — here are our favorites under $25"><figcaption><em>. </em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Award:</strong> Best overall face moisturizer | <strong>Score:</strong> 5/5 | <strong>Size:</strong> 1.7 oz. | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Shea butter, gransil blur, bioactive ceramides </p><p>This Shop TODAY Beauty Awards winner for "best overall face moisturizer" is designed to prevent signs of aging and reduce wrinkles.

I love how much it actually moisturizes, since it feels pretty light. And I like the pump, it’s easy to get out with one hand, rather than other most expensive moisturizers that you have to scoop..." Deabler says. </p><p>Senior social media editor Kate McCarthy is also a lover of this CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing lotion. “I’ve been using CeraVe products for years, and recently added this moisturizer to my routine in the past six months.

"This gel cream, though, is juuuuuust right. The all-day hydration it delivers and how quickly it absorbs into my skin are huge wins, but I’ve noticed a considerable reduction of excess oil in the three months I’ve used this moisturizer in my morning routine. It’s also easy to build up makeup on top of it without having to worry about pilling!" she explains. </p><p>The Dewy Skin Cream</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> 1.7 oz. | <strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Green tea</p><p>“I have dry skin and during the winter months, it’s even dryer and tends to flake," explains associate editor Shannon Garlin. "I recently received this moisturizer in a press kit from Sephora and it has been a life saver during these dry months.
