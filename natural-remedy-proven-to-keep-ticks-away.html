If you prefer natural methods, prepare this simple herbal infusion. Drink it daily, and you'll forget about ticks.</p></strong><p>Ticks are tiny arachnids from the subclass Acari. They range from a fraction of a millimeter to even 1 inch. They feed on the blood of mammals and birds and carry many serious diseases, such as Lyme disease, bartonellosis, and babesiosis.</p><p>The season of increased tick activity begins in June and ends in September. During this time, we are particularly at risk of being bitten. What should you do to avoid ticks? Reach for an herb that you can buy at any store. Drink it daily, and the pests won't even come close.</p><h2>What repels ticks in humans?</h2><p>Ticks feed on the blood of mammals and birds. They live in forests and parks but are increasingly found in urban areas. They hide in tall grasses and attack unexpectedly. What attracts ticks? The smell of sweat, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and pheromones. Due to their small size, their presence on the body is invisible. After each outing, you should carefully inspect your entire body. Ticks can attach themselves in unusual places such as the groin, armpits, or earlobes.</p><p>What repels ticks in humans? Arachnids are very sensitive to scents. They cannot stand the aroma of lavender, rosemary, thyme, basil, lemon, lemongrass, and camphor. Essential oils from these plants are the basis of natural tick repellents. However, there is another unassuming shrub that not only repels ticks but also eases the course of Lyme disease.</p><h2>Drink daily. Ticks won't even come close to you</h2><p>Rock rose is a small shrub cultivated in countries by the Mediterranean Sea. The plant contains flavonoids, polyphenols, phenolic acids, and essential oils that repel mosquitoes and ticks. It also has antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. It neutralizes enzymes responsible for the breakdown of collagen fibers and supports the proper functioning of the digestive and immune systems.</p><p>How to use rock rose for ticks? Get some dried rock rose herbs. Put two teaspoons in a cup and pour boiling water over them. Let it cool, and then drink the contents. Use it regularly, and ticks won't even come close. You can use the prepared infusion to make a natural tick-repelling spray. Pour it into a bottle with an atomizer and spray it on yourself before each outing.</p><p><b>Read also:</b></p><p>Tick invasion.
