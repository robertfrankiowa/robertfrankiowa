    <main><h1>Metformin For Weight Loss: How Long Does It Take to Finally Work?</h1><h2>How Long Does It Take for Metformin to Work for Weight Loss?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There’s no set time frame for how long it takes metformin to work for weight loss. While research shows people notice weight loss and a reduction in BMI around the three-to-six-month mark, weight loss could start sooner than this and can vary from person to person.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">For example, a 2017 study looked at 73 women with obesity who either took 1000mg of metformin or 360mg of orlistat — another weight loss medication — for three months. Although the group taking orlistat lost more weight, metformin was still found to be effective within the relatively short study period. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Those taking metformin lost weight and had a reduction in their body mass index (BMI) and waist size — all within three months. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Another study, this time from 2013, looked at 199 people without diabetes with a BMI of 27 or higher. Out of this group, 154 participants took metformin daily for six months. They had a mean weight loss of about 13 pounds by the end of the six-month period. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">By six months appears to be the sweet spot. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">A 2020 meta-analysis backs this up. It looked at 21 studies on metformin treatment for those with overweight and obesity. In total, the meta-analysis included more than 1,000 participants with a baseline BMI from 26 to 41. Studies ranged from three months to 32 months.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The researchers concluded that metformin treatment caused a “modest reduction in BMI.”  The BMI of participants with simple obesity — that is, obesity without an underlying medical cause — reduced by 1.3 units. In those with type 2 diabetes obesity, BMI decreased by 1 unit. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The key takeaway in regards to timing? There was a reduction in BMI even in studies that were shorter than six months. But six-month-long studies showed the best results — after six months of treatment, BMI did not decrease significantly, and some regained weight at 12 months. It’s also worth noting that the researchers in this meta-analysis noted that research on metformin, treatment duration and expected results are still developing.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Beyond weight loss, you may notice other metformin benefits much sooner. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">A 2006 study on people with type 2 diabetes found fasting plasma glucose levels (the amount of sugar in your blood after fasting) were reduced by the first week of treatment. Levels kept dropping until week eight where they stabilized until the end of the 12-week experiment. </p><figure><img title="How Long Does It Take for Metformin to Work for Weight Loss?" src="IMG/BB1nk4CR_how_long_does_it_take_for_metformin_to_work_for_weight_loss.jpg" alt="How Long Does It Take for Metformin to Work for Weight Loss?"><figcaption><em>How Long Does It Take for Metformin to Work for Weight Loss?. eternalcreative/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Does It Take Metformin to Start Working in Your Body?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It takes 1.5 hours for metformin to start working in your body once it’s been absorbed, and it may take about three hours to start working after you take it. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">But, of course, that doesn’t mean you’ll start losing weight the same day. It can take a little while for metformin to change the numbers on the scale. Weight loss is a slow-and-steady game. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">How does metformin help you lose weight exactly? It’s not fully understood how metformin works for weight loss, but it can help lower blood sugar levels and suppress your appetite, helping you eat fewer calories. </p><h2>How Quickly Will You Lose Weight on Metformin?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">How quickly you lose weight on metformin will all depend on your body. While research shows people lost weight after taking metformin for three to six months, that doesn’t mean they didn’t start losing weight before this point. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">We all react differently to medication. Plus, your diet and exercise habits can make a difference in how quickly you lose weight on metformin, too. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Don’t be afraid to ask your provider when they think you can expect to notice some changes.</p><h2>How Can I Speed Up Weight Loss on Metformin?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">You can’t necessarily <i>speed up</i> weight loss on metformin. Sticking to your metformin prescription and any lifestyle changes your healthcare provider recommends — things like exercising consistently, getting proper rest and eating a healthy diet — can help make the treatment more effective, but you can’t rush the process. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">As corny as it sounds, weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint, and everyone’s weight loss journey will look different. It’s something that takes time, patience and precaution.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It’s also worth noting that metformin alone has been shown to lead to modest weight loss. It can be taken alongside other prescription medications, however, so your doctor may create a personalized treatment plan that’s more effective for weight loss for you than metformin alone.</p><figure><img title="How Can I Speed Up Weight Loss on Metformin?" src="IMG/AA1o2fcp_how_can_i_speed_up_weight_loss_on_metformin.jpg" alt="How Can I Speed Up Weight Loss on Metformin?"><figcaption><em>How Can I Speed Up Weight Loss on Metformin?.

They can assess your dose and determine whether you need to increase it,or they may recommend a different medication altogether. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Your doctor might also want to discuss your diet and exercise habits and whether you need to make any tweaks there, or whether you simply just need a little more time on metformin and your current weight loss plan to notice the changes. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Don’t panic if metformin isn’t working. There are other ways to lose weight, including other oral medications, weight loss injections, surgery and drug-free interventions that could work better for you and your body. You’ll get there.</p><figure><img title="What to Do If Metformin Is Not Working for Weight Loss?" src="IMG/BB1m2pk2_what_to_do_if_metformin_is_not_working_for_weight_loss.jpg" alt="What to Do If Metformin Is Not Working for Weight Loss?"><figcaption><em>What to Do If Metformin Is Not Working for Weight Loss?. nortonrsx/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How to Take Metformin for Weight Loss</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Your doctor can tell you how to take metformin for weight loss. There are different forms of the drug and how you take it personally may vary. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">For the extended-release tablets, for example, it’s usually recommended to take metformin once a day, at the same time each day, ideally with your evening meal.  </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Depending on your dose, immediate-release tablets may be taken two or three times a day, with meals.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tip: Taking metformin with a meal can reduce the risk of gastrointestinal upset. Check out our blog on the best time of day to take metformin for more info.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Unless instructed otherwise, you should swallow tablets whole — no crushing, cutting or chewing. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Metformin is often prescribed alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise to aid weight loss. A healthcare provider can give you guidance on the best changes to make for your lifestyle. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Wondering what dose of metformin for weight loss is best? There’s no clear-cut answer to that. For extended-release tablets for diabetes, a healthcare professional may prescribe a starting dose of 500mg of metformin once a day. This dose may then increase by 500mg each week, up to a maximum of 2,000mg a day. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">A healthcare provider can help work out the best dose of metformin for weight loss for you.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Look out for the common side effects of metformin, which include: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Indigestion </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Nausea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Vomiting </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Diarrhea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Flatulence</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Asthenia (feeling weak or lacking energy) </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Stomach pain </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Headache </p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Metformin can also cause a vitamin B12 deficiency, which may be linked with anemia. Stopping the medication or starting vitamin B12 supplementation appears to reverse this.  </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Seek medical advice if you notice any serious side effects. Lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in your blood) is a potential serious side effect of metformin. Signs of this condition include feeling dizzy, having unusual muscle pain or a slow or irregular heartbeat. You’re more at risk of lactic acidosis if you have a health condition like kidney and liver problems. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sounds scary, but for the most part, metformin is considered safe and people tolerate it well over years of treatment. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There are a few groups of people who shouldn’t take metformin. Before taking metformin, let your doctor know if you have any medical conditions like kidney or liver problems or type 1 diabetes, or if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. And share any prescription or over-the-counter medications and supplements you’re taking.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">You may not have to avoid metformin altogether, but you may need a different dose of certain medications. People on sulfonylureas, for example, may need to take a lower dose if they take metformin as the combo can increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). </p><figure><img title="How to Take Metformin for Weight Loss" src="IMG/BB1ma0pX_how_to_take_metformin_for_weight_loss.jpg" alt="How to Take Metformin for Weight Loss"><figcaption><em>How to Take Metformin for Weight Loss. SeventyFour/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Can Someone Without Diabetes Take Metformin for Weight Loss?</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Yes, people without diabetes can take metformin for weight loss. Metformin has been shown to be effective for weight loss even in those without diabetes. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">For example, the 2013 study we mentioned earlier studied 199 participants without diabetes with a BMI of 27 or higher. Among the 199 participants, 154 took a daily dose of up to 2,500mg of metformin for six months — the average metformin dose was 2,230mg daily. The remaining 45 participants weren’t treated with the drug. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">After six months, the metformin-taking group had a mean weight loss of about 13 pounds. Those who weren’t taking metformin experienced <i>weight gain</i> — almost two pounds on average.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There’s no one set metformin dosage for weight loss in people without diabetes. But this study suggests up to 2,500mg of metformin can help those with overweight and obesity lose weight, whether they have insulin resistance — like those with type 2 diabetes — or not. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Metformin may be more effective for those who have insulin-resistance. Both groups lost weight, but the group with severe insulin resistance lost significantly more weight than insulin-sensitive participants. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Metformin can also be useful for those with prediabetes — this is when you have high blood sugar levels, but they’re not yet high enough to diagnose type 2 diabetes. If you’re at high risk of type 2 diabetes, metformin may reduce your risk by 31% over three years. Research shows metformin can aid weight loss and support a reduction in waist circumference, while also reducing type 2 diabetes risk.</p><h2>Final Thoughts on When to Expect Weight Loss with Metformin</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If only losing weight was as easy as flipping a switch. Unfortunately, it’s often a slow and steady process — even when drugs like metformin are involved. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Here’s the TL;DR on metformin and weight loss:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>It may take weeks or months to see weight loss on metformin</b>. Research shows people lose weight after three to six months of treatment. But don’t let that put you off. Weight loss works best when it’s slow and sustainable. And everyone is different, so there’s no set time frame for metformin weight loss — or any other weight loss for that matter. </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Speak to your prescribing doctor if metformin isn’t working.</b> You may need a higher dose, a different medication, a few healthy diet and exercise tweaks, or simply more time on your current weight loss plan to notice any changes. Good things take time.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Metformin can help you lose weight and reduce your BMI and waist circumference. </b>And alongside weight loss, it can cut your risk of type 2 diabetes if you’re at high risk for the condition. It can also be prescribed alongside other prescription meds for a personalized solution that may work better for you and your body. </p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Metformin is promising as a weight loss drug, but it’s not your only option. There are other medications out there. You can learn more about diabetes medications like Ozempic vs. metformin, for example.  </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re exploring your options, there are plenty of weight loss treatments that can help you on your weight loss journey.</p></main>
