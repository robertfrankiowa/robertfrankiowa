    <main><h1>15 Healthier Caffeine Options When You Need a Boost</h1><p><p>A lot of us can’t start the day without our caffeine fix, and many of us keep ingesting it all day long or when we need a boost of energy or attentiveness. Drinking coffee loaded with sweeteners isn’t exactly the healthiest way to do this, nor is relying on high-sugar, heavily caffeinated sodas and energy drinks. So what are some other, better ways to get that boost you need?</p><figure><img title="15 Healthier Caffeine Options When You Need a Boost" src="IMG/BB1ojJp8_15_healthier_caffeine_options_when_you_need_a_boost.jpg" alt="15 Healthier Caffeine Options When You Need a Boost"><figcaption><em>15 Healthier Caffeine Options When You Need a Boost.

You can buy this product in bulk and not add sugar to it.</p><figure><img title="Yerba Mate Energy Drinks" src="IMG/BB1ojGQk_yerba_mate_energy_drinks.jpg" alt="Yerba Mate Energy Drinks"><figcaption><em>Yerba Mate Energy Drinks.

It gives you a good jolt of caffeine without all the tasty junk that’s bad for you.</p><h2>Green Tea</h2><p>In addition to caffeine, green tea has antioxidants that are good for your system. It’s a gentler energy boost than coffee is, but it might be all you need.</p><h2>Coca Leaves</h2><p>Yes, this is what people make cocaine from, but these leaves also have a historical use in Andean countries as mild stimulants and for pain management. In the U.S., you can legally use them only with a medical prescription.</p><h2>A Good Night’s Sleep</h2><p>One of the reasons so many people lean on caffeine all day long is that they don’t get proper rest at night. If you regularly get a good night’s sleep, you’ll naturally feel more awake and energetic.</p><h2>Unsweetened Iced Tea</h2><p>A lot of people only know iced tea with sweeteners such as lemon and sugar. Unsweetened iced tea has the same amount of caffeine, and it’s easy to prepare. For some, it’s an acquired taste, but others like it just the way it is and prefer it over sweetened tea.</p><h2>Caffeine Pills</h2><p>If you want caffeine but not everything that drinks with it come with, you can try caffeine pills and other such OTC energy bursts. Just be careful not to take too many, which can leave you overly wired, a very disconcerting experience.</p><h2>Green Apples</h2><p>The carbs in Granny Smith apples are great for a fast, all-natural energy boost. Plus, you get all the other healthy benefits of apples without having any kind of crash.</p><h2>Creatine</h2><p>A lot of people use creatine for high-energy activities like sprinting and weightlifting. As with caffeine pills, be sure to use it according to directions so you avoid overdoing things.</p><h2>Black Tea</h2><p>Black tea is inexpensive and easy to make. You can enjoy it hot or cold, and flavored or unflavored. Most people drinking unsweetened iced tea are drinking black tea.</p><h2>Ground Cacao Husks</h2><p>You can find these in some Whole Foods and other specialty foods stores. Some people mix them with mushroom powder or some other ingredient they like. You’ll get an energy boost and may come to prefer it over coffee.</p><h2>Beets and Beet Powder</h2><p>Beets provide a boost similar to that you get from caffeine. Like green apples, they also don’t come with any type of crash.</p><figure><img title="Beets and Beet Powder" src="IMG/BB1ohggK_beets_and_beet_powder.jpg" alt="Beets and Beet Powder"><figcaption><em>Beets and Beet Powder.

Those who do this find an amazing regenerative effect that can feel like starting the day anew.</p><h2>Cold Shower or Splash</h2><p>A cold shower is pretty much guaranteed to wake you up and clear out the cobwebs quickly. If you can’t grab one during the day, just go to a bathroom sink and wash your face with cold water; it will help reinvigorate you without putting anything into your body.</p><figure><img title="Cold Shower or Splash" src="IMG/BB1ojLOO_cold_shower_or_splash.jpg" alt="Cold Shower or Splash"><figcaption><em>Cold Shower or Splash.

You’ll probably feel more energy the next day and can maybe go without your caffeine fix(es).</p><h2>20 Food to Stockpile (For the Best Chance of Survival)</h2><p>A well-stocked pantry can provide peace of mind and empower you to handle any situation. Whether it’s a natural disaster, economic instability, or simply unexpected guests, having a stash of versatile essential foods can make all the difference.</p><p>Here’s a list of 20 of the best foods to stockpile, ensuring you’re ready for whatever comes your way.</p><p><strong>20 Food to Stockpile (For the Best Chance of Survival)</strong></p><h2>12 Everyday Foods Some People Just Can’t Stand</h2><p>When it comes to their foods, some people are just picky eaters. It’s surprising how certain popular foods can be so divisive. While many people love them, others can’t stand the taste, texture, or even the idea of eating them.
