    <main><h1>Lose Abdominal Fat in 100 Days with the MIND Diet</h1><p>The MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet is a brain-healthy diet that can help lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. "One of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the MIND diet had a reduction in their risk for AD," nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, ScD, tells RUMC. "I think that will motivate people." Not only is the diet good for your brain, but it can also help with weight loss as well—here's how to lose abdominal fat in 100 days with the MIND diet.</p><figure><img title="Lose Abdominal Fat in 100 Days with the MIND Diet" src="IMG/AA1neHVT_lose_abdominal_fat_in_100_days_with_the_mind_diet.jpg" alt="Lose Abdominal Fat in 100 Days with the MIND Diet"><figcaption><em>Lose Abdominal Fat in 100 Days with the MIND Diet. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 Nutrient-Dense Foods</h2><p>Nutrient-dense foods such as fish and vegetables are great for weight loss and a staple of the MIND diet. "Nutrient-dense foods such as fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts, and olive oil are recommended. Not all fruits and vegetables are recommended equally," Barbara Broggelwirth, RDN, CDN, tells Mather Hospital.</p><figure><img title="1 Nutrient-Dense Foods" src="IMG/AA1nvNhi_1_nutrient_dense_foods.jpg" alt="1 Nutrient-Dense Foods"><figcaption><em>1 Nutrient-Dense Foods. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Lots of Berries</h2><p>Berries are highly recommended on the MIND diet and are a great weight-loss food. "For instance, berries are emphasized since they have been shown to decrease neuron loss and improve memory," Broggelwirth says.</p><h2>3 Whole Grains</h2><p>Whole grains are part of the MIND diet and are good for your health and waistline. "Whole-grain foods help control of cholesterol levels, weight, and blood pressure," says the Mayo Clinic. "These foods also help lower the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions."</p><h2>4 Nuts</h2><p>Nuts can be enjoyed on the MIND diet. "In just a handful of nuts, which is about an ounce or a quarter of a cup, you get a lot of bang for the buck," registered dietitian Kathy McManus tells Harvard Health. "They contain anywhere from 3 to 7 grams of protein per ounce, 1 to 3 grams of fiber, and 160 to 200 calories."</p><figure><img title="4 Nuts" src="IMG/AA1nVhWr_4_nuts.jpg" alt="4 Nuts"><figcaption><em>4 Nuts. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Legumes</h2><p>Legumes are an important part of the MIND diet. Research shows that people who eat beans, chickpeas, lentils, or peas every day may lose more weight than those who don't.</p><h2>6 Leafy Greens</h2><p>Eat plenty of leafy greens to blast belly fat. "Leafy greens such as spinach, romaine lettuce, kale, and collard greens have been shown to be particularly protective and are recommended at least six times a week," Broggelwirth says.</p><h2>7 Olive Oil</h2><p>Olive oil is part of the MIND diet. "When you drink olive oil daily, something extraordinary can happen to you," sports nutritionist Abigail Roberts tells Gloucestershire Live. "Olive oil, particularly extra-virgin olive oil, is one of the biggest superfoods. It is packed with antioxidant compounds like vitamin E, oleacein, and oleocanthal. As well as compounds called polyphenols, which are phenomenal for your hair, skin, joints, and weight."</p><h2>8 Be Mindful of Wine</h2><p>Wine is permitted on the MIND diet, but don't have too much. "Aim for no more than 1 glass daily," Abbi Smith, MA, RD, LD, tells Purdue Extension. "Both red and white wine may benefit your brain. If you're unable to consume the target number of servings, don't quit the MIND diet altogether. Research has shown that following the MIND diet even to a moderate degree is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment."</p><figure><img title="8 Be Mindful of Wine" src="IMG/AA1nYJaa_8_be_mindful_of_wine.jpg" alt="8 Be Mindful of Wine"><figcaption><em>8 Be Mindful of Wine. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Avoid Sweets</h2><p>Sweets are bad for your waistline and severely restricted on the MIND diet. Have less than 5 servings a week of pastries and sweets and less than 1 serving a week of fried foods and cheese.</p><h2>10 Fatty Fish</h2><p>Eat at least one serving of fatty fish a week, not just for brain health but for weight loss and fat burning. "It is best to choose fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, trout, tuna, and mackerel for their high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids," Smith says.
