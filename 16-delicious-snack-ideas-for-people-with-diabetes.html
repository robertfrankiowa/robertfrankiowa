    <main><h1>16 Delicious Snack Ideas for People with Diabetes</h1><h2>Apple with Peanut Butter</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 1 medium apple: 94 calories, 0.3g fat (0g saturated fat), 0 cholesterol, 1.8mg sodium, 25g carbohydrate (19g sugars, 4g fiber), 0.5g protein.</p><p>2 tablespoons peanut butter: 188 calories, 16g fat (3g saturated fat), 0 cholesterol, 147mg sodium, 6g carbohydrate (3g sugars, 2g fiber), 8g protein.</p><p>A small apple with the skin and a couple tablespoons of peanut butter makes a fiber- and protein-rich snack. This classic combination provides a quick energy boost and a sweet and nutty treat any time of day. Slice up one small apple and spread one tablespoon of homemade peanut butter on the pieces.</p><h2>Horseradish Deviled Eggs</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 2 egg halves: 146 calories, 13g fat (3g saturated fat), 215mg cholesterol, 169mg sodium, 1g carbohydrate (1g sugars, 0 fiber), 6g protein.</p><p>Hard-boiled eggs are a handy high-protein and zero carb snack that won't increase blood sugars. Add horseradish and you've got a slightly spicy bite that's completely craveable. Make a batch for the week ahead! If you're insulin-dependent, add a slice of whole-grain toast or ten whole-grain crackers which will provide about 15 grams of complex carbs that offer perfect protection against your blood sugar going too low.</p><h2>Caprese Salad Kabobs</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 1 kabob: 44 calories, 4g fat (1g saturated fat), 5mg cholesterol, 10mg sodium, 2g carbohydrate (1g sugars, 0 fiber), 1g protein.</p><p>With plenty of vegetables and healthy fats from olive oil, salad on a stick is an ideal nosh for people with diabetes. Make these ahead of time to keep in the fridge for a quick nibble between meals. The tomato and basil bring fresh flavor, while the mozzarella makes it satisfying. Since some balsamic vinegars have sugar added, double-check the ingredient label or make your own zero carb version such as this delicious Strawberry-Basil Vinegar recipe.</p><p>By the way, these are the best salad dressings for people with diabetes.</p><figure><img title="Caprese Salad Kabobs" src="IMG/BB1gKqWg_caprese_salad_kabobs.jpg" alt="Caprese Salad Kabobs"><figcaption><em>Caprese Salad Kabobs.

Chia seeds can add an appetite-taming upgrade to smoothies and yogurt too.</p><h2>Spicy Pumpkin Seeds</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 1/4 cup: 103 calories, 7g fat (1g saturated fat), 0 cholesterol, 158mg sodium, 9g carbohydrate (0 sugars, 1g fiber), 3g protein.</p><p>With 7 grams of protein per ounce, pumpkin seeds can help squash hunger in minutes. These seeds are also an ideal alternative if you have a nut allergy. Studies suggest that compounds in this festive snack can slow down the absorption of carbs in the gut helping to keep blood sugar balanced. Consider adding plain, shelled varieties to other dishes such as salads and baked goods. They're also high in magnesium, a mineral known to protect heart health.</p><h2>Greek Yogurt</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 6 ounces Fage Total 0%: 90 calories, 0g fat (0g saturated fat), 10mg cholesterol, 65mg sodium, 5g carbohydrate (5 sugars, 0g fiber), 18g protein.</p><p>With twice the protein of the regular variety, Greek yogurt has more staying power to keep you feeling full longer which could help with weight management and balancing blood sugar. Yogurt also provides a good boost of calcium plus vitamin D, a combination thought to help optimize blood sugar control. Sweeten up yogurt naturally with fresh berries, make it savory with a swirl of pesto or add nuts for crunch.</p><h2>Tex-Mex Popcorn</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 1 cup: 44 calories, 3g fat (0 saturated fat), 0 cholesterol, 150mg sodium, 5g carbohydrate (0 sugars, 1g fiber), 1g protein.</p><p>If you tend to want lots of volume in a snack, popcorn is the perfect pick. A whopping three cups make the typical serving and popcorn is a blank canvas to dress with your favorite seasonings. This Tex-Mex variety turns up the heat. You can also try Parmesan cheese, or a mixture of Romano cheese, basil and oregano. Since popcorn is a complex carbohydrate that contains fiber, it won't ratchet up blood sugar the way other high carb snack foods do.</p><h2>Fiesta Shrimp Cocktail</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 1 cocktail: 134 calories, 5g fat (1g saturated fat), 115mg cholesterol, 359mg sodium, 6g carbohydrate (3g sugars, 1g fiber), 16g protein.</p><p>You might feel a little fancy eating this for a snack, but this spin on shrimp cocktail is a delectable appetizer that can be made for one or many.

Consider pairing it with whole-grain crackers to add some crunch and an extra dose of fiber.</p><h2>Raw or Cooked Vegetables</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 100 g cooked broccoli: 35 calories, 0.4g fat (0.1g saturated fat), 0mg cholesterol, 41mg sodium, 7.2g carbohydrate (1.4g sugars, 3.3g fiber), 2.4g protein.</p><p>Fresh broccoli, cauliflower or even dill pickles make a crunchy snack with or without hummus or other dips. Get creative—add vegetables to skewers with a drizzle of vinaigrette. Remember, any non-starchy vegetable can easily be roasted to make an easy-to-eat snack, too.</p><h2>Ricotta Cheese</h2><p><strong>Nutrition Facts</strong><br> 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta: 216 calories, 16.1g fat (10.3g saturated fat), 63.2mg cholesterol, 104mg sodium, 3.8g carbohydrate (0.3g sugars, 0g fiber), 14g protein.</p><p>Spoon a large dollop of this creamy, comforting cheese into a bowl, sprinkle with cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract, then stir for an easy-to-make and satisfying dessert-like snack that's both high in protein and calcium. If your hunger is really high, make it even more filling by topping with some slivered almonds, which are known to help keep blood sugar down even after a meal.</p></main>
