    <main><h1>15 Fitness Products Reviewers Said Helped Motivate Them To Work Out</h1><h2>1.A¬†weighted fitness hoop¬†about to ~turn~ up your workout. Reviewers say this is great for not only strengthening your core but also relieving back aches from sitting for too long.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I saw these on TikTok, and I wanted to try it because I HATE working out. But y‚Äôall ‚Äî I received mine today and it was so easy, AND SO FUN. I can feel it working cause it makes my whole body tired when I stop. Very easy to put together, and it‚Äôs easier than an actual fitness hoop. I was skeptical at first because I always buy workout stuff then shove it in my closet and never use it again ‚Äî but <strong>I can already tell I‚Äôm going to use this everyday. I love it,¬†</strong>and I‚Äôm excited to start seeing results. ü•∞ü•∞" ‚ÄîMookie</p><h2>2.An¬†illustrated yoga mat¬†here to help guide you through a yoga flow without having to venture out to a class or have an instructor at all. You'll be able to see exactly how the poses look and use it to switch up your practice, keeping your workout fresh and fun.</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1pzAhj_reviewer_sits_on_black_yoga_mat_with_pose_pictures.jpg" alt="reviewer sits on black yoga mat with pose pictures"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>The mat¬† is 24‚Äù wide x 68" long and 5mm thick! It's made with a moisture-wicking material that'll keep sweat at bay and is great for hot yoga, too.</p><p><strong>Promising reviews:</strong> "<strong>I use this mat more than I ever took classes.</strong> Not sure if it is good for beginners, but if you have basic class instruction already, it gives you a great sequence of moves you are familiar with. Most I can do, a few I have never done." ‚ÄîMng Parker</p><p>"This mat is great for a quick guide to various yoga poses. The length, thickness, and comfort makes it a great purchase. I look forward to many future uses." ‚ÄîBaglady</p><h2>3.A set of gold-tone 3-pound dumbbells¬†because aesthetically-pleasing workout equipment *can* help you get excited for a strength workout. And as a bonus, you can leave them out as decor because they'll look nice in your home (and maybe seeing them more will also motivate you to work out).</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "They‚Äôre so pretty! Blogilates really put a lot of thought into the design. Comfortable soft cushioned grip, beautiful pink and gold colors. <strong>It makes me actually want to work out!</strong>" ‚ÄîMky</p><h2>4.Push-up bars¬†you'll have ~a-round~ for a long time because they'll make doing push-ups on the floor more comfortable and also an even better workout. The handles let you get a good grip and then rotate as you go down, so you don't slip or slide at all. These are also great for anyone who's still working on their push-up game (it's okay, I am too) because they work just as well if you're on your knees.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "The first time I used them, I felt burn (the good kind) in the back/neck area. I looked up a diagram of musculature online, and it corresponded precisely with the trapezius muscles. <strong>I know that a product can't cure lazy, but knowing that I'm doing push-ups the right way and being able to feel the results makes me want to do more push-ups</strong>." ‚Äîmcba</p><h2>5.A Booty Kicker because barre class is great, but those class prices start to add up fast. If you invest in this, you'll have all the equipment you need to practice at home (and won't have to rely on your not-so-sturdy kitchen chair). Plus, it folds flat so you can keep it out of sight (and out of mind) when you're not in class.</h2><p>And I can't forget to mention one of the coolest features: It has a dumbbell rack at the bottom that fits 1-pound, 2-pound, and 3-pound weights. How cool is that?!?</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I'll be honest...I bought this on a whim and then didn't put it together for months. I almost returned it because I hadn't used it, but I'm so glad I didn't. I LOVE THIS BARRE. <strong>I look forward to using it every day (and I really don't care to work out generally). It's so fun to use and you can find so many barre classes online for FREE.</strong> It's also super easy to fold up and store and for me, that's super important because I live in a tiny space. This is THE best workout tool." ‚ÄîKathryn</p><h2>6.A Stealth core trainer perfect for anyone who needs a little extra motivation to get a workout in. This genius tool is a video game balancing board where you use your abs to get high scores. How cool is that?!?</h2><p>Don't forget to download the app before you get started so you can play the four free games!</p><p>Stealth Fitness is a small business that created this to help make working out fun.¬†</p><p><strong>Promising review: </strong>"I really don't enjoy exercise. Using this board, with the app, has made planking more tolerable. I like that it's game-based, so that I can feel more like I'm playing a game than exercising. And I will say, <strong>the games make me want to go back and do more so that I can better my score</strong>. A nice way to make planking a little less dull and a little less like an exhausting routine." ‚ÄîAlly Cat</p><h2>7.A yoga wheel to help you increase your mobility and strengthen inversion as you flow through your practice. It works to not only help stretch your back but also help release tension along your spine.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I love this wheel, and I received it less than a week ago! I was worried at first since being close to 200 lbs, I didn‚Äôt think it could hold my weight, but it does very well. I have lower back pain and have been to a chiropractor, physical therapy, and have taken pain meds, but this is the only thing that has brought me the quickest pain relief. <strong>I actually look forward to getting up in the morning and using this to relieve the tension in my low back.</strong> I do feel with the other methods I‚Äôve tried that I‚Äôm healing, but I am certain that this wheel has been the most effective pain relief for me. I use this wheel in combination with some exercises specifically for low back pain relief. I've used this for less than a week, and I feel close to how I felt before suffering from low back pain. I would recommend this to anyone. I also plan to continue to use this as part of my daily stretching routine even after my back heals." ‚Äîklt</p><h2>8.A NordicTrack exercise bike¬†worth the investment because you'll be able to have a great cycling session no matter the weather outside. It has a touchscreen display that stimulates the ride, 22 resistance levels, and three pound weights so you can cross-train! Plus, it comes with a 30-day iFit membership trial so you can stream live and on-demand workouts.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "My husband and I were looking for something to stimulate our motivation to exercise. We love biking but recently moved to a very hilly area. Because of bad knees and our age, biking is very difficult. After doing a lot of research, we found the NordicTrack Commercial Studio Cycle.¬†</p><p><strong>This bike makes exercising something to look forward to doing. The rides are so interesting and various.</strong> Love that the two of us are able to save each of our own stats, as we each like different themes. Another feature we like is the fact that the bike simulates the ride you are watching. Additionally, if the going gets too hard on my knees, the bike lets me change it for a more comfortable ride. All in all, I would highly recommend the NordicTrack Commercial Studio Cycle. It's a fun way to exercise." ‚ÄîMMB</p><h2>9.Or a¬†rolling desk bike¬†that's a viral TikTok sensation for a reason ‚Äî it will keep you active and moving all day, while staying comfortable enough to get your work done. Just imagine the places you'll go with this thing.</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1pzy49_reviewer_sits_on_same_rolling_desk_bike_while_working_from_home.jpg" alt="reviewer sits on same rolling desk bike while working from home"><figcaption><em>. Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>See it in action on TikTok here.¬†</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "My friend recommended this home bicycle to me. I bought it for my small apartment. It looks exactly like the pic. The material quality is high, the setup is easy, and the size is perfect for a small apartment. I am so excited for its working board design. No matter I have to do extra work at home or browse the internet, I can do it with biking.<strong> It definitely¬†motivates¬†me when I do not have time to go to the gym or run outside.</strong> More importantly, it is not noisy at all, so I do not have to worry about using it too late or too early. Very satisfied with the purchase." ‚ÄîBaggioYang</p><h2>10.A simple jump rope with a digital counter that's great if you're a beginner who is looking for ways to ~switch~ up your cardio routine. You'll ~jump~ at the chance to use the counter to start a mini competition with yourself to see how many reps you can get it every day.¬†</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I am impressed with this product! It's super light weight, easy to use and to hold, and has made working out fun again! The buttons are easy to use, it took less than a minute to set up, and it keeps track of how many jumps and feels comfortable in the hands. <strong>I find myself using it daily and since the handles keep track of how many jumps, I try to break the previous days records!</strong> Definitely would recommend!" ‚Äîcassandra</p><h2>11.A Chopper¬†here to help you live out your lumberjack fantasy while also getting a ~killer~ workout in. You can just pick it up and chop away or use the free app to follow one of the 60 pre-built circuits.¬†¬†</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "I‚Äôll admit that I thought this was a gimmick at first. That being said, it is a lot of fun chopping away after a stressful day at work. I just put on my favorite TV show and go to town. This isn‚Äôt meant to be a magic fitness tool. <strong>It is just a novel/fun way to get you to exercise without thinking about it too much.</strong> The free app has some nice workout routines you can try as well." ‚ÄîCAT</p><h2>12.A compact, foldable treadmill¬†so you can get your steps in, even if you're working from home (and then do other things after you clock out). The handrail on the machine can be raised or lowered, meaning you can walk, jog, or even run while staying in the same place. And when you're done, just slide it under your bed.</h2><p><strong>Promising reviews:</strong>¬†"Obsessed. I‚Äôve been working from home since March 2020 and have struggled with a sedentary life. <strong>Since I got this treadmill for under my desk, I actually look forward to starting work, feel more productive, and have been easily getting in 15,000‚Äì20,000+ steps a day</strong>. Wish I did this sooner!"¬†‚ÄîLauren O.</p><h2>13.A weighted fitness hoop,¬†which will quickly become your favorite workout once you get into the ~swing~ of things. It's super easy to use (especially if you've ever Hula-Hooped as a child) and works to help strengthen your hips, abs, and legs.</h2><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "This hoop is GREAT! <strong>It is just so much¬†fun¬†to exercise with this thing. I play music and try to dance too lol.</strong> But I have experience, they used to have a weighted hoop in the gym I went to and I did it all the time. Highly recommend. You just need to make sure it's clicked together correctly or it'll come undone! Don't worry if it happens to you, though, it's totally fixable. It happened to me I think twice before I got it down. Anyway, if you're looking for a weighted hoop, look no more!" ‚ÄîMolls</p><h2>14.An exercise ball¬†great if you're looking to work on improving your posture, balance, core strength, and more. It's also helpful for both modifying exercises (especially if you have a hard time getting all the way down to the floor) and making others more challenging. All a~round~, this is a great tool to have in your corner.</h2><p>UrbnFit is a small business creating a variety of different pieces of fitness equipment.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Came in a compact box with a hand pump. Pretty easy to blow up! I use it at my desk instead of a chair, and it's been great for my posture. Also just super fun to bounce around on and stretch with. <strong>It's so fun to use that it actually has motivated me to do little ab workouts with it every day. </strong>Seems very durable and great quality for such a good price! :)" ‚ÄîAmazon Customer</p><h2>15.An upper-body workout bar you can attach to a doorway to make doing pull-ups a breeze. Plus, you can take it on and off to help you with other exercises, such as tricep dips, and then put it right back on the door when you're done.</h2><figure><img title="Provided by BuzzFeed" src="IMG/BB1pzF6h_model_doing_a_pull_up_with_the_silver_and_black_bar_attached_between_a_door_frame.jpg" alt="Model doing a pull-up with the silver and black bar attached between a door frame"><figcaption><em>.

Provided by BuzzFeed</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bar fits in up to 35.4-inch door frames. Plus, it has three grip positions; narrow, wide, and neutral. </p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong> "Like other reviews stated, it does exactly what it claims. I've had this product for around two years now, and it's still in great shape. It was used daily as my roommates and I would all use it, so it is pretty reliable. <strong>I was never big into pullups but buying this product gave me the motivation to finally start doing pull-ups.</strong> I've done all types of hanging core/ab exercises and pull-ups on it, and it is pretty stable, as long as you don't do any fast jerking movements that cause the safety bar to lift off the back of the door frame. A set of dumbbells and the Iron Gym Bar is all you need to get a nice workout in when you can't make it to the gym." ‚ÄîRoger</p><p><i>Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.</i></p></main>
