While there's undoubtedly been a major cultural shift in the collective perception of mental health and treatment for psychiatric disorders, finding a therapist that you click with, whether you're looking for cognitive behavioral therapy or emotion-focused therapy, <em>still</em> isn't exactly a seamless or judgment-proof process. </p><p>As the growing effort to remove the stigma that's shadowed the discourse surrounding mental and psychological health for ages continues to widen, teletherapy (therapy sessions conducted via phone calls, video conferences, and chat) has become increasingly available and desirable, thanks in part to more convenience and flexibility with appointments.</p><p>Aside from that, many patients simply feel more comfortable and relaxed during sessions when they're in the comfort of their own home, rather than a potentially intimidating clinical setting. Still, finding the right therapist can be a grueling process of trial and error. Remember, you and the therapist you see first are "trying out" the relationship both ways. If it doesn't work out right away, this process can feel pretty discouraging, and can often leave those in need exhausted (because no one wants to re-hash their life story again and again to new people before meeting "the one"). It's kind of like using dating apps; you give your new date the same "best version of yourself" shpeal as if you're on a job interview, only to discover the chemistry is off, or you get ghosted and have to move onto the next match.</p><p>Fortunately, just like dating apps, most online therapy platforms make choosing the right therapist for you, your lifestyle, and concerns pretty easy by asking you a series of questions and taking intel on your personal preferences (i.e. which gender you prefer and what type of symptoms or experiences you're looking to work on). Sure, it's not a foolproof process, but it's nice to narrow down the search with preferences.</p><p>While medication can be and is often a necessary part of mental health treatment, talk therapy has really helped me identify common thought patterns, which has helped me become more self-aware and able to distinguish when it's my anxiety talking versus my logical mind. Of course, one common critique of telemental health is that the therapeutic benefits will be lesser than face-to-face sessions. While this will vary for each person, some studies have indicated that virtual therapy can be just as effective as in-person care.</p><p>Finally, although it sucks to say it, therapy can be downright expensive, especially if you don't have insurance or government health care assistance. Ahead, we've outlined the best online therapy resources for a variety of different budgets to help you get the care you need (and 100 percent deserve) without having to step foot in a daunting medical office.</p><p><em>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you'll love as much as we do.
