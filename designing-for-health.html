    <main><h1>Designing for Health</h1><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Have you ever walked into a room and immediately felt calm? Well, according to science, it may all be in your head…literally. The way we design and decorate our living spaces can actually have a powerful impact on our mental health. Believe it or not, you have the power to create spaces that promote relaxation, reduce stress, and enhance your overall well-being. To experience it for yourself, here’s how you can improve your mental health through interior design.</p><h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]">The Science Behind Interior Design and Mental Health</h2><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Interior decorating isn’t just about making a space look nice. It can make a space <i><em class="italic">feel</em></i> nice, too. In fact, there’s an actual psychology behind it.</p><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">How we perceive color, nature, organization, light, space, and visual appeal has a big impact on our mental and emotional health. And because these elements are a big part of the design process, they play just as big a part in shaping your mood and overall well-being. Take a look at how they can positively impact the mind:</p><h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]"><b><strong class="font-bold">Color</strong></b></h3><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Color can have a big impact on the mind. According to color psychology, cool colors like blue, green, and light purple tend to promote calm, which can help to keep anxiety down. On the other hand, warmer colors like red or orange can thought to promote energy and excitement.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Home & Texture" src="IMG/BB1oIxmc_designing_for_health.jpg" alt="Designing for Health"><figcaption><em>Photo credit: 10’000 Hours.

But a neat and tidy home with adequate storage can keep you feeling cool, calm, and collected.</p><h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]"><b><strong class="font-bold">Lighting</strong></b></h3><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Natural daylight is known to improve your mood, vitality, and sleep quality. If you don’t have a lot of natural light, try installing skylights or hanging sheer curtains to make your space feel big and vibrant.</p><h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]"><b><strong class="font-bold">Layout</strong></b></h3><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Open, spacious layouts that are kept neat and tidy can boost your mood, especially when you compare them to the more cramped, cluttered spaces. Creating a sense of openness can elevate your emotional state.</p><h2 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h3 leading-[36px] pt-[21px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]">4 Interior Styles That Boost Mental Health</h2><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">If you want to improve your mental health at home, you can.

Featuring clean lines, a neutral color palette, and no clutter, this interior style is best for keeping a clear mind.</p><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">According to research, a cluttered space can negatively impact your mental health. So if you want to declutter your mind, decorate your space using a ‘less is more’ approach.</p><h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]">Biophilic Design</h3><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Interior styles that bring nature into the home like biophilic design can help calm your mind. Nature is a great stress reducer, and just decorating with a couple of plants and other natural items can improve your overall well-being.</p><h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-h4 leading-[30px] pt-[15px] pb-[2px] [&_a]:underline-offset-[6px] [&_.underline]:underline-offset-[6px]">Scandinavian Style</h3><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">Scandinavian design is a popular design style that focuses on functionality, simplicity, and natural materials. And fortunately, any style that emphasizes clean lines and natural elements like that can create a tranquil ambiance, giving you peace of mind.</p><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">To add to the calm vibe, be sure to decorate with light wood tones, neutral colors, and plenty of natural light to achieve a peaceful look and feel.</p><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">A bohemian chic design style is a good choice if you want to feel comfy and cozy. It plays with a mix of colors, patterns, and materials inspired by cultures from all over the world. Because of that, a bohemian design promotes a kind of layered, cozy feel that can add a lot of homeyness to a space.</p></main>
