Her financial adviser recommended she consolidate the 401(k) and IRA and use that money to buy an annuity. But I am not certain of the terms. </p><h2> <em>   ‘I know she wants to leave something for my brother and me, but we both have well-paying jobs, and do not need her money.’     </em></h2><p>I recommended she put them into a CD ladder. She is very risk-averse, but was debating putting her 401(k) and IRA into the market with an indexed fund; again, she doesn’t really need the money. I know she wants to leave something for my brother and me, but we both have well-paying jobs, and do not need her money. We would rather she use it for herself.</p><h2>Dear Reader, </h2><p>Your mom is very fortunate — not just because of her nest egg, home and health, but for having children who have put so much thought into her financial wellbeing. Because of her current financial situation, she has a lot of options. </p><p>Regarding long-term care: You’re right that she could probably self-fund long-term care, as many wealthy individuals do, but that could be an expensive road. A 65-year-old today has a 70% chance of needing some sort of long-term care in their lifetime, according to the Administration for Community Living. About a fifth of people who do need long-term care will require that support for more than five years. And keep in mind, women tend to need care for longer than men. </p><p>You mentioned she could rent her home or sell it outright to use that money, but the latter would be a drain on her assets, and the former could become a headache if she needs to return home, or to have someone manage the property while she’s away. You don’t want to go from a point where she’s well-off and comfortable to a precarious, debt-riddled state. Selling the home is often considered a last resort, even for people covered under Medicaid.</p><h2> <em>   You don’t want her to end up in a precarious, debt-riddled state. Selling the home is often considered a last resort, even for people covered under Medicaid.     </em></h2><p>Of course, insurance products are typically more expensive the older a person gets, and she may not qualify for everything, but it never hurts to shop around when you’re creating an action plan. Look at other products to compare to the adviser’s recommendation, such as a hybrid package that combines life insurance with long-term care. A hybrid plan pays for long-term care, the amount of which depends on the terms, but if that never happens, it can pay a death benefit when the insured dies.</p><p>Also, look into a qualified longevity annuity contract, also known as a qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC). There are so many factors that go into picking the right one with the appropriate payout and payout date, and how much is used to fund the plan. Some QLACs will also allow a return of premium, according to Northwestern Mutual. You don’t have to go with the first (or even the second or third) product recommended to you — there are always choices. </p><p>QLACs may help your mother’s RMD issue. The money put toward these contracts doesn’t count toward RMD withdrawals, but by coming out of the retirement accounts directly, they lower the balance that affects the ultimate distribution required. Your adviser may have been suggesting something similar to this when he or she mentioned consolidating the retirement accounts. </p><p>Your idea to ladder CDs makes sense if she’s risk-averse. Treasuries are another possibility, as they are also low-risk. But interest rates may change your mind, as they may not be as high in the future as they are right now (and you don’t want inflation to eat away at the principal).  </p><p>She’ll have to pay taxes on those withdrawals, whether she needs the money or not. Because she’s 72 and in good health, investing it in a conservative way could make sense as it gives her another layer of diversification. There’s no way to know for sure how long a person will live, but by investing for the long-term, she can have that money work for her should she eventually need it. </p><p>But there’s a caveat. Investing in the market only works if she is comfortable with it. She should still be able to sleep at night and be confident she won’t panic at any market movement, especially in a downturn.</p></main>
