As we navigate life, the importance of humor and joy becomes increasingly clear. Embracing laughter can lead to a stronger immune system, enhanced mood and reduced stress. To learn more about the benefits of laughter, we spoke to experts on how your favorite funny story impacts your body, as well as fun ways to incorporate more humor in your daily routine. Plus, we're sharing some fantastic female comedians over 50 who are guaranteed to make you crack a smile. </p><h2>Laughter is contagious</h2><p>Laughter is a universal human experience - an involuntary, physical reaction to stimuli. While we can experience laughter on our own, it mostly occurs in social settings. In fact, laughter is a social emotion. An article in <em>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</em> found that laughter is behaviorally contagious, and we're 30 times more likely to laugh with others present. </p><p><strong>See also:</strong> Top MD Shares the Surprising Secret to Lifelong Joy: Unleashing Your Inner Child</p><h2>How laughter benefits your body</h2><p>According to Deborah Gilman, PhD, owner and licensed psychologist at Fox Chapel Psychological Services, "laughter triggers the release of endorphins, your body's natural painkillers. These endorphins can help manage some menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and muscle aches. Additionally, laughter can lower stress hormones like cortisol, leading to better sleep and a calmer mood." </p><p>Steven Sultanoff, PhD, a psychologist and adjunct professor at Pepperdine University Graduate School of Education and Psychology, adds that laughter also boosts immune function by increasing levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), which helps fight respiratory infections. Laughter may even help manage blood sugar levels and increase infection-fighting antibodies.</p><h2>How laughter benefits your mind</h2><p>While laughter itself is a physical response, the humor that makes us chuckle plays a more important role in lifting your spirits. "Humor activates ‘mirth,' the emotional response to humor," Sultanoff explains. "That response reduces distressing emotion and increases uplifting emotions such as joy, pleasure and delight." He adds that humor also activates "wit," which can allow us to see different perspectives, and "relational fusion," which fosters interpersonal bonding. </p><p>Stressful day? It's laughter to the rescue again. "Laughter is like a stress reset button for your brain," Gilman says. "It decreases anxiety and lifts your mood by triggering the release of feel-good chemicals like serotonin. This can be especially helpful for managing symptoms of depression, which can be more common during menopause due to hormonal changes."</p><h2>How to tap into the benefits of laughter</h2><p>It's easier than you might think to surround yourself with humor. Whether it's spending time with people who make you laugh or hosting more game nights, a regular giggle can brighten your day without a lot of effort. Try some of these tips below: </p><h2>1. Join a laughter yoga class</h2><p>"If you're looking for a fun and social way to manage stress, boost your mood, and connect with others, then laughter yoga might be worth checking out," Gilman says. "The key benefit of laughter yoga is that it doesn't rely on jokes or humor. It focuses on the physical act of laughter itself. Laughter yoga combines elements of laughter, breathing exercises, and playfulness."</p><p>Check out the 15-minute laughter yoga video below to get started.</p><h2>2. Crack a joke</h2><p>"Many people <em>love</em> to share their humor," says Sultanoff. He suggests sharing "stories, anecdotes, riddles, jokes as well as other funny moments." This causes you to experience the same emotions as when you first experienced them. In fact, Sultanoff says, "For many individuals, the sharing is actually more delightful than the original experience. As we share humor, we are emotionally uplifted, physically aroused and creating bonds with others." </p><h2>3.
