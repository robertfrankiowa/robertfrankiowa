Bran can effectively aid weight loss and improve well-being, but it also brings many other health benefits that are useful not only during a diet.</p></strong><p>Bran and oatmeal have a lot in common. Bran is the outer layer of grains from which flakes are made. They are the result of grinding cereals such as wheat, oats, rye, or spelt. Once considered waste, today, bran is valued for its health properties. It contains enormous amounts of fiber, minerals, and vitamins concentrated precisely in this outer part of the grain.</p><h2>Why is it worth eating bran?</h2><p>In the store, it's easy to find different types of bran. The most popular are wheat, oat, and rye bran. All contain fiber but differ in composition and properties. <strong>Wheat bran is the richest in fiber, making it ideal for people on a diet.</strong> Oat bran, although it has less fiber, provides valuable linoleic acid. On the other hand, rye bran is rich in potassium and magnesium, which positively affect heart function and help regulate blood pressure.</p><p><strong>Fiber plays a vital role in the fight against overweight. </strong>Dietitians recommend products rich in this ingredient, and bran, especially wheat bran, is an excellent source. Consuming fiber from bran makes the feeling of fullness last longer, which reduces the urge to snack between meals.</p><p>In addition, bran positively affects metabolism and benefits the intestines, potentially reducing the risk of colon cancer. <strong>They support the development of beneficial gut microflora and help regulate blood glucose levels.</strong> If you have a problem with high cholesterol, incorporating bran into your diet may prove very helpful.</p><h2>Using bran in the kitchen: How to eat bran?</h2><p>Once you get used to the taste of bran, you will see that they have many uses in the kitchen. Their valuable properties do not disappear during cooking or baking. <strong>You can roast them in a pan, add them to salads or slaws, creamy soups, and even use them in sweet baked goods like oatmeal cookies or bread.</strong> They also fit well with vegetarian pâtés and potato pancakes and can be used as breading for meat or vegetable cutlets. They work great as an addition to muesli as well.</p><figure><img title="Pixabay" src="IMG/BB1pwFYl_based_on_bran_you_can_prepare_healthy_and_delicious_desserts.jpg" alt="Based on bran, you can prepare healthy and delicious desserts."><figcaption><em>Based on bran, you can prepare healthy and delicious desserts..
