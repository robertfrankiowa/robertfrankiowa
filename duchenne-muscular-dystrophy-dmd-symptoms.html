    <main><h1>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Symptoms</h1><p><p>Physical and Cognitive Signs to Monitor </p><strong>Medically reviewed by Nicholas R. Metrus, MD</strong><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting. This leads to changes in joint and bone structure, which can affect organs such as the lungs and lead to an array of other symptoms.</p><p>DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder, a genetic pattern that causes it to develop almost always in males. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. People with DMD do not produce dystrophin, a protein that strengthens muscle fibers and controls contraction and relaxation.</p><p>While other muscular dystrophies can appear in adults later in life, DMD affects people from birth. Babies born with DMD begin to show signs of disease during their first two years of life. Early symptoms of muscle weakness begin in the arms and legs, causing delays in gross motor skills such as walking.</p><p>In this article you will learn about DMD symptoms—when they begin, types of progressive and chronic symptoms, how parents and specialists can identify symptoms, and how to manage symptoms and treatment side effects.</p><p><h3>A Note on Gender and Sex Terminology</h3><p>Verywell Health acknowledges that sex and gender are related concepts, but they are not the same. To reflect our sources accurately, this article uses terms like “female,” “male,” “woman,” and “man” as the sources use them.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1mCHA8_symptoms_of_duchenne_muscular_dystrophy.jpg" alt="Symptoms of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"><figcaption><em>Photo composite by Michela Buttignol for Verywell Health; Getty Images.

Babies with DMD may fail to meet early milestones such as head control. However, it often takes time to differentiate these symptoms of DMD from other developmental delays.</p><p>With early symptoms, there is no muscle wasting or weakness, but there are developmental delays. It isn’t until more classic signs of the disease develop that DMD will be suspected.</p><p>If babies continue to fail to meet milestones, such as sitting independently or walking as they grow, a healthcare provider might look for other typical signs of DMD.</p><p>These signs usually develop around the ages of 2 to 3 years and include symptoms such as difficulty climbing stairs, toe walking, and the presence of Gower’s sign, where a child stands by placing their hands on their shins and walking them up their legs.</p><h2>Physical DMD Symptoms in Children</h2><p>Symptoms of DMD in children involve muscle loss and weakness. These symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk</li><li>Delayed speech</li><li>Increased size of the calf muscles</li><li>Weakness in the muscles of the upper arms and legs</li><li>Muscle loss in the arms and legs</li><li>Waddling gait (how a person walks)</li></ul><h2>Progressive and Chronic DMD Symptoms </h2><p>As children age, DMD symptoms progress and may cause complications. Progressive and chronic DMD symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Scoliosis (a curvature of the spine)</li><li>Difficulty breathing</li><li>Cardiomyopathy (a change in the structure of the heart)</li><li>Joint contractures (a joint is stuck in a bent position and can’t be moved passively or actively)</li><li>Muscle loss and weakness of the thighs and chest muscles</li><li>Loss and weakness of the muscles in the rib cage, which can lead to respiratory infections and, ultimately, respiratory failure</li><li>Involvement of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, slowing the digestion process, causing constipation and diarrhea</li><li>Between the ages of 10 to 23 most children with DMD will need a wheelchair due to the progression of the disease.</li></ul><p>In some cases, DMD can cause complications that require emergency medical attention. Often, these are related to the lungs and heart.</p><p>As muscle loss and weakness affect the area around the lungs, people with DMD become more at risk for serious infections, such as pneumonia. They may also need help with breathing and coughing. This can lead to an emergency where assisted ventilation is necessary for survival.</p><p>The heart is a muscle that is also affected by DMD. People with DMD can experience heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and other rhythm abnormalities that may also require emergency medical attention.</p><h2>How Parents Could Identify DMD Signs </h2><p>Parents often sense if there is something not quite right with their child. When thinking back, parents who have children with DMD recall seeing signs around 6 months, even though the diagnosis didn’t occur until the ages of 3 to 5.</p><p>In some cases, parents were dismissed as being overly worried. However, that should never deter you from voicing your concerns. If you notice any signs of DMD, such as failing to meet early milestones, bring them up to your child’s provider.</p><p>DMD is a rare disease. Most children who fail to meet milestones will not have DMD. However, parents who suspect their child may have DMD should note their concerns.</p><p>Signs of DMD that parents can identify and discuss with their child’s healthcare provider include:</p><ul><li>Delays in speech and language development</li><li>Delays in meeting milestones, such as sitting up</li><li>Difficulty sitting, standing, walking</li><li>Trouble walking up or down stairs</li><li>Gower’s sign, walking hands up legs to stand</li><li>Difficulty keeping up with other kids during play</li></ul><h2>How Specialists Identify DMD Symptoms</h2><p>Specialists will look for many of the same signs parents can identify. Researchers have noted that some early delays can be signs of DMD in infants. These include:</p><ul><li>Poor head control</li><li>Difficulty sitting independently</li><li>Not crawling</li><li>Failing to begin walking by 18 months</li></ul><p>Around age 3 to 4 a specialist will begin to look for the following more classical symptoms:</p><ul><li>Difficulties walking, running, jumping</li><li>Gower’s sign</li><li>A waddling gait</li><li>Struggling to walk up stairs</li><li>Walking on the toes</li><li>Muscle pain or cramps</li><li>Behavioral issues</li><li>Speech delay</li><li>Autism spectrum disorder (a developmental and neurological disorder)</li><li>Calves that are large in comparison to other muscles of the legs</li></ul><p>If DMD is suspected, a specialist can also run blood tests. A blood test to check creatine kinase (an enzyme found in the muscles) levels is very telling.  </p><p>Elevated creatine kinase levels are associated with DMD. If levels are elevated, a specialist can investigate further. The specialist may order genetic tests and muscle biopsies (removing a sample of tissue for analysis in a lab) to confirm or rule out DMD.   </p><h2>Managing DMD Symptoms and Treatment Side Effects</h2><p>While there is no cure for DMD there are treatment options to help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. The standard protocol for treating DMD focuses on the muscles, heart, and lungs.</p><p>Corticosteroids are prescribed to help muscle function and delay the need for a wheelchair and effects of the disease on the heart. Physical therapy can also help people with DMD remain mobile for longer.</p><p>As respiratory function decreases, non-invasive ventilation methods are used to help with breathing.</p><p>Medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers can help with DMD’s effects on the heart.</p><p>While effective, long-term use of corticosteroids can lead to side effects such as weight gain, osteoporosis (progressive loss of bone mineral density and bone mass), bone fractures, and behavioral changes. Physical therapy can help people on these medications to remain as mobile and strong as possible to avoid weight gain and effects on the bones.</p><p>Other medications and therapies are being researched that address the genetic component of the disease and show promise in slowing progression.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked genetic disorder that almost exclusively affects males and causes muscle loss and weakness. DMD is a progressive disease diagnosed within the first 3 to 5 years of life.</p><p>Symptoms of DMD include difficulty sitting independently, walking, running, and standing, delayed speech, and weakness in the upper arms and legs. As the disease progresses, other symptoms arise, including scoliosis, joint contractures, cardiomyopathy, and difficulty breathing.</p><p>By the age of 10 to 12, most people with DMD will need a wheelchair. When DMD affects the lungs and heart, emergencies can arise due to a lack of oxygen or heart failure.</p><p>Parents of children with DMD often note delayed milestones and other classic signs, such as difficulty walking or going up stairs. Specialists examine these and conduct further testing to determine whether someone has DMD.</p><p>Standard treatment for DMD includes corticosteroids and physical therapy, but treatment options are being researched that show promise in delaying the progression of the disease.</p>
