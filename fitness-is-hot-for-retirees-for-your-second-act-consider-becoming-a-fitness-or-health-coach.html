    <main><h1>Fitness is hot for retirees: For your second act, consider becoming a fitness or health coach</h1><figure><img title="istock" src="IMG/AA1ms3TR_for_your_second_act_consider_becoming_a_fitness_or_health_coach.jpg" alt="For your second act, consider becoming a fitness or health coach"><figcaption><em>Fitness is hot for retirees: For your second act, consider becoming a fitness or health coach. istock</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>This article is reprinted by permission from </em><em>NextAvenue.org</em><em>.</em></p><p>In a world increasingly pursuing longevity and vitality, seeking well-being has evolved into a lifelong endeavor. As individuals across the lifespan prioritize health and fitness, mature adults find themselves uniquely positioned at the crossroad of experience and opportunity within the flourishing health and fitness industry.</p><p>A report from the Department of Health and Human Services reveals a remarkable trend – from 1998 to 2018, the percentage of adults over 65 meeting aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines more than doubled, from 5.5% to 13.9%. This surge in activity among older adults presents a golden opportunity to serve these clients and contribute to expanding this positive and welcome trend. </p><p>Active individuals contemplating a second-act career are perfectly placed to take advantage of this growth in demand and thrive in the health and fitness field while gaining numerous benefits for their own lives.</p><h2><strong>Inspiring and guiding others </strong></h2><p>Patricia Linderman of Falls Church, Virginia, never imagined that she would transition to becoming a health coach in her 50s. She spent years being sedentary and working a desk job writing and editing, and her weight was starting to creep up on her. After reading the book “Younger Next Year,” she was inspired to switch her diet to mainly unprocessed foods and join a gym. </p><p>She discovered Zumba, aqua aerobics and weight training, and a year later, she had lost over 40 pounds. Today, at age 62, Linderman is the founder of Fierce After 45, where she helps women over 45 develop healthy habits, move with ease, nourish their bodies, manage stress and add more fun to their lives.</p><p>Linderman is an inspiration and an example for others that it’s not too late to improve your health, even at midlife and beyond. She’s used her experience to build a business, guiding others to improve their health and well-being.</p><p><strong>Also on MarketWatch:</strong> Afraid rising cost of living will kill your retirement goals? You’re not alone  </p><h2><strong>Renewed purpose </strong></h2><p>Retirees often grapple with the challenge of a sense of purpose slipping away. Studies reveal that 93% of retirees desire to feel useful during their post-career phase. Opportunities in health and fitness address this need and provide a pathway to genuinely impact lives by enhancing overall well-being. </p><p>Adela Vangelisiti, a professionally trained ballet dancer in her 50s, became a certified Silver Swans chair ballet instructor and taught at low-income senior housing developments. In an interview she said, “Of all my endeavors, this has been the most enriching in my life.” Her new career has brought her fulfillment and elevated the quality of life for others. </p><h2><strong>Flexible part-time work</strong></h2><p>One allure of a career in health and fitness lies in the flexibility it provides. Personal training and teaching group exercise classes are usually hourly work, making it easier to balance the opportunity with other commitments or interests. It can be an excellent fit for a flexible or part-time job. </p><p>Individuals like Becky Harkema, from Iowa City, Iowa, transitioned from a CEO position to a personal trainer and fitness instructor, offering virtual classes and online personal training for older adults. This work allows her to pursue her love of travel, teaching and training from anywhere. Venues like health clubs, community centers, and retirement communities actively seek professionals to lead diverse movement classes. </p><p>Certifications in various fitness and movement disciplines — such as Zumba, chair yoga, Bodypump and aqua aerobics—open doors to these opportunities. Leading classes is an opportunity to build community among participants and ensure you and your clients stay active and socially engaged. </p><p><strong>You might like:</strong> Here are some of the coolest volunteer opportunities for retirees</p><h2><strong>Creating experiences for active aging </strong></h2><p>Physical activity enthusiasts can turn their passions into reality by creating tailored fitness experiences for active aging individuals. Arlo Niederer, a retired geophysicist and avid rock climber, leads the Boomers Climb Club in Colorado Springs. The club serves as a supportive local community for fellow rock climbers to come together to practice and improve their rock climbing skills. </p><p>Lynn Jordan of Los Angeles created Joyful Boogie after touring senior living facilities for her aging parents. The programs offered at the homes didn’t excite her or make her look forward to her aging process. This inspired her to create her program that incorporated her training in yoga and dance to offer something fun, joyful, empowering and accessible for all ability levels. </p><p><strong>Also see: </strong>How to keep cycling into your 50s, 60s and 70s</p><h2><strong>Training and certifications </strong></h2><p>Acquiring certifications is highly recommended to navigate the health and fitness industry successfully. Three main types include:</p><ul class="articleList"> <li>  Personal training and group exercise   </li> <li>  Specialty certifications (e.g., yoga and Pilates)   </li> <li>  Health coaching certifications   </li> </ul><h2><strong>Harness your work history </strong></h2><p>Skills developed over the years, such as relationship building, professionalism and emotional maturity are valuable assets in an industry often skewed toward youth. Your diverse background can set you up for success as a health and fitness professional. </p><p>As Dan Duran, a former police officer who transitioned to become a successful personal trainer, noted in an interview, “All the skills you learn in other careers or in life are what I believe truly make you successful as a personal trainer. That is some maturity. The ability to communicate. Those are some of the skill sets that helped me take off,” he said.</p><p>With the growing active aging market, mature adults often seek guidance from someone who understands their life stage. As a mature fitness professional, your relatability fosters trust, especially for those embarking on their fitness journey in later years. </p><p><strong>Plus: </strong>You’re retired and ready to learn a new skill. What’s the best skill to learn?</p><h2><strong>Career opportunities </strong></h2><p>Whether you aspire to work in a gym, lead fitness classes, become a dedicated personal trainer or even venture into entrepreneurship, the world of health and fitness offers a plethora of opportunities to make a significant difference in people’s health and well-being. </p><p>The demand for dedicated professionals who can cater to the mature adult population is higher than ever, providing a fulfilling and rewarding path for those looking to embrace a second-act career in the industry.</p><p><em>Erin Eleuterio is a dedicated health and fitness professional with a commitment to improving the lives of individuals over the age of 50. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and is a certified functional aging specialist helping others develop strength and resilience. She is the creator of the “</em><em>Second Act Fit Pros</em><em>” podcast where she interviews people that have transitioned to a second act career in health and fitness and those dedicated to improving the health and well-being for the mature adult population.</em></p></main>
