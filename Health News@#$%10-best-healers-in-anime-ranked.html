    <main><h1>10 Best Healers In Anime, Ranked</h1><p>Anime has diverse character archetypes that often feature healers, who are characters endowed with the power or skill to mend wounds, revive spirits, and even defy mortality. These characters, often imbued with a blend of strength and compassion, play pivotal roles in driving the narrative forward and ensuring the survival of other characters.</p><p>From medical prodigies like Tsunade to those harnessing mystical powers like Sailor Saturn, anime healers can perform miraculous feats. While they might not always be at the forefront of battles, their significance cannot be understated. This list celebrates and highlights some of the most iconic healers in anime.</p><h2>       Akiko Yosano - Bungo Stray Dogs     </h2><p>Akiko Yosano is a prominent character in Bungo Stray Dogs. As a gifted doctor, she stands out for her unique healing ability called Thou Shalt Not Die. This ability allows her to heal any injury, but with a crucial limitation: she can only activate it on individuals on the brink of death.</p><p>As a result, her healing process can be excruciating for the recipients, as they must be severely injured before she can intervene. Besides her medical prowess, Yosano often exhibits a strict demeanor towards her patients.</p><h2>       Shinra Kishitani - Durarara!!     </h2><figure><img title="Provided by DualShockers" src="IMG/AA1gdMSM_shinra_kishitani_from_durarara.jpg" alt="Shinra Kishitani from Durarara!!"><figcaption><em>Shinra Kishitani from Durarara!!.

Though sometimes seen as vulnerable, Orihime's growth throughout the series showcases her determination, courage, and unwavering desire to protect her friends.</p><h2>       Elizabeth Liones - Seven Deadly Sins     </h2><figure><img title="Provided by DualShockers" src="IMG/AA1gdzpN_elizabeth_from_the_seven_deadly_sins.jpg" alt="Elizabeth from The Seven Deadly Sins"><figcaption><em>Elizabeth from The Seven Deadly Sins.
