    <main><h1>12 Belly Flattening Carbs You Should Eat To Stay Energized and Satisfied!</h1><h2>Oats</h2><p>Start your day with a bowl of oats to kickstart your metabolism. Oats are rich in beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that aids in digestion and prolonged satiety, making them a perfect breakfast option for a flat belly.</p><figure><img title="Oats" src="IMG/BB1m6Ba7_oats.jpg" alt="Oats"><figcaption><em>Oats.

Its high fiber content helps prevent bloating and keeps you satiated longer.</p><h2>Green Bananas</h2><p>Green bananas are high in resistant starch, which resists digestion and feeds your healthy gut bacteria, reducing bloating and promoting a flat belly.</p><h2>Sweet Potatoes</h2><p>Swap out white potatoes for sweet potatoes. They’re lower on the glycemic index, which means they’re digested slower and won’t spike your blood sugar. Plus, they’re packed with fiber and vitamins A and C.</p><figure><img title="Sweet Potatoes" src="IMG/BB1m6KC0_sweet_potatoes.jpg" alt="Sweet Potatoes"><figcaption><em>Sweet Potatoes.

It promotes healthy bacteria in the gut, which is essential for a flat belly and overall health.</p><h2>Brown Rice</h2><p>Switching from white to brown rice can have significant benefits. Brown rice has more fiber, which means it keeps your digestive system running smoothly.</p><h2>Chickpeas</h2><p>Chickpeas are not only a great source of plant-based protein but also rich in fiber. They help control appetite and reduce calorie intake at meals. <strong>Roasted Chickpeas</strong> can be flavored sweet or savory.</p><h2>Lentils</h2><p>Lentils are a powerhouse of nutrition. They’re full of fiber and protein, making them an excellent carb choice for energy and a flat belly.</p><figure><img title="Lentils" src="IMG/BB1m6DzC_lentils.jpg" alt="Lentils"><figcaption><em>Lentils.

It’s a healthier option that helps you feel full longer and supports a flat belly.</p><h2>Apples</h2><p>An apple a day could keep the belly fat away! Apples are rich in fiber and have a high water content, which helps you feel full and reduces unnecessary snacking. If you have<strong> Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</strong> you may want to avoid apples as they are higher in <strong>FODMAP</strong>s and could cause stomach upset.</p><h2>Berries</h2><p>Berries, such as raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries, are fiber-rich fruits. They’re sweet, yet low in calories, making them perfect for a flat-belly diet.</p><h2>Beans</h2><p>Beans are a fantastic source of soluble fiber, which helps fight inflammation that can cause belly fat accumulation. They’re also a great protein substitute for meat.</p><h2>Whole Grain Bread</h2><p>Opt for whole grain bread over white bread. The whole grains are full of fiber, which aids in digestion and contributes to a flat belly.</p><h2>Chia Seeds</h2><p>Chia seeds are tiny but mighty. They’re extremely high in fiber and can absorb water to form a gel, which expands in your stomach to help keep you feeling full for hours. <strong>Check out this recipe for Overnight Chia & Oats.</strong></p><h2>A Happier Healther You!</h2><p>Incorporating these 12 fantastic carbs into your diet can lead to a happier, healthier gut and a flatter belly.
