    <main><h1>15 Self Care Activities That Don’t Break the Bank</h1><p>We should all be aware of the benefits of self-care, and in an era when discussions over mental health are more open, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t make ourselves a priority. As various issues gather more attention, a new industry has developed around well-being, and it can be a costly business.</p><p>Self-care needn’t be cost-prohibitive, however. Working with a budget doesn’t mean you must compromise.</p><h2>1. Walking</h2><p>Movement is vital to our routine, and walking is free. Even gentle exercise offers advantages, so take a break and boost your step count. Walking around the yard is a good start if you have little time to spare but have space around your home.</p><h2>2. Meditation</h2><p>Learning meditation techniques shouldn’t cost a fortune, and finding free resources is possible. I’ve discovered many great routines on a leading video-sharing channel that have helped me relax and de-stress at the end of the day. Secondhand books are also available; you can borrow them for free at your local library.</p><h2>3. Focus on Your Breathing</h2><p>Meditation will also teach you about breathing techniques that can help release stress instantly. We don’t always have time to call up a video and plug in headphones, but regulating your breath offers a boost, and it’s another completely free mental health tip.</p><figure><img title="3.

Vitamin D supplied by natural sunshine offers several physical and mental health benefits while staying indoors can have potentially adverse effects. If the weather isn’t great, take a break and spend a few minutes in the yard.</p><h2>5. Watch a Comedy</h2><p>Laughter also has positive advantages for our state of mind. Even if it’s hard to raise a smile, take a moment to watch your favorite comedy show. Forced laughter is good enough to make a difference, and comedies are widely available via video sharing and TV subscription packages.</p><h2>6. Listen to Music</h2><p>Music affects our mood, and an uplifting track has the potential to switch our feelings from negative to positive. Head to your favorite streaming service or put on a CD at home. It’s another cheap way to work on self-care and battle against daily challenges.</p><h2>7. Cost-Effective Hobbies</h2><p>Taking up a new hobby allows you to focus on something different and can be a great stress-buster. Certain hobbies, particularly ones I’ve considered, such as metal detecting and archery, can be expensive, so you need to choose carefully. Bird watching and baking are among many cheaper alternatives.</p><h2>8. Put the Kettle On</h2><p>While we should all be aware of our caffeine intake, a quick tea or coffee offers an ideal break. Our favorite beverages provide comfort, so don’t feel guilty about grabbing one. A glass of water is a good substitute if you’re not into hot drinks.</p><figure><img title="8. Put the Kettle On" src="IMG/BB1i57gM_8_put_the_kettle_on.jpg" alt="8. Put the Kettle On"><figcaption><em>8. Put the Kettle On. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9. Cook Your Favorite Dish</h2><p>If you feel chicken soup is good for the soul, put it on your menu. If you prefer another dish, prepare that instead. You shouldn’t overdo your comfort foods since that can become tedious, but meal planning is an essential but often overlooked area of self-care.</p><h2>10. Yawn</h2><p>Yes, you read that correctly. Some health professionals recommend yawning to boost your heart rate and keep you mentally aware. It’s better to practice alone; otherwise, people will think you are rude or weird.</p><h2>11. Keep a Diary</h2><p>Those who pay close attention to their self-care often journal their thoughts and activities. It’s a great way to monitor progress and identify positive areas and areas that need attention. Many prefer pen and paper, as writing can also be therapeutic.</p><figure><img title="11. Keep a Diary" src="IMG/BB1iZBMR_11_keep_a_diary.jpg" alt="11. Keep a Diary"><figcaption><em>11. Keep a Diary. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>12. Make Positive Plans</h2><p>Like many others, I’ve found that having something to look forward to is essential. Making plans for a vacation or a small treat at the end of the week has positive benefits. The reward cost is up to you, but the planning stage is free.</p><h2>13. Take a Hot Bath</h2><p>Hot baths are calming and can ease stress after a long day. Another good tip is to add some Epsom salts. These help with physical aches and pains while potentially topping up our magnesium levels lowered by stress.</p><h2>14. Go Off Grid</h2><p>Why not leave all your tech at home as part of your holiday plans? Many people use going off-grid to relax while they are away. Leave the phones and laptops behind and enjoy the simple pleasures we used to enjoy before technology took over our lives. If you can’t accommodate this type of trip, put that phone away for a few hours as you head out for your daily walk.</p><h2>15. Talk</h2><p>The first step on the road to recovery is to talk to someone. If you have a trusted close friend or family member, work through your issues as they lend a sympathetic ear. It costs nothing, but talking is one of the best forms of therapy and should always form part of your self-care routine. If your budget allows, you can move on to arrange for a professional therapist to take over.</p><h2>17 Items to Cut From Your Budget You Won’t Miss</h2><p>Are you feeling the pinch in your wallet?
