    <main><h1>17 Anti-Inflammatory Lunch Recipes in Three Steps or Less</h1><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Jessica Ball, M.S., RD</strong><p>Make one of these flavorful, anti-inflammatory lunches in just three steps or less. They’re packed with inflammation-fighting ingredients like legumes, whole grains and dark leafy greens to help you combat pesky symptoms of chronic inflammation, such as joint stiffness, digestion issues and mental fog. Simple and nutritious recipes like our Fiber-Packed Spicy White Bean & Spinach Salad and 3-Ingredient Salmon & Veggie Sandwich make lunchtime easier and more delicious than ever.</p><h2>Fiber-Packed Spicy White Bean & Spinach Salad</h2><p>In this light and refreshing salad, we season white beans with ras el hanout, a Moroccan spice blend which features cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, ginger, cardamom and ground black and red pepper. If you prefer a creamier texture, gently mash some of the beans as you stir everything together. The bean salad is served on a bed of lightly dressed spinach that pairs well with the beans, but also grilled chicken or steak kebabs on another night.</p><h2>Green Goddess Wrap</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1j70FI_a_recipe_photo_of_the_green_goddess_wrap.jpg" alt="a recipe photo of the Green Goddess Wrap"><figcaption><em>Photographer: Fred Hardy, Food Stylist: Jennifer Wendorf.

If you prefer, you can ditch the wrap and enjoy the filling as a salad instead.</p><h2>Farro Salad with Arugula, Artichokes & Pistachios</h2><p>Precooked farro makes this dish come together in no time. And you can make it in the same bowl you serve it in, minimizing cleanup!</p><h2>The Best Tuna Salad Recipe for Sandwiches</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1bxoRB_a_recipe_photo_of_the_best_tuna_salad_recipe.jpg" alt="a recipe photo of the Best Tuna Salad Recipe"><figcaption><em>Photographer: Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Emily Nabors Hall, Prop Stylist: Josh Hoggle.

We use Greek-style yogurt in place of mayonnaise to bind everything together and to add a tangy, creamy finish. You could take this up a notch and make it a "Waldorf tuna salad" by adding 2 tablespoons toasted chopped walnuts, 3 tablespoons quartered small grapes and 1 tablespoon additional Greek yogurt. Serve over a bed of greens or between two slices of whole-grain bread.</p><h2>3-Ingredient Salmon & Veggie Sandwich</h2><p>This 3-ingredient salmon sandwich recipe is a great way to use up leftover cooked veggies and salmon (you can also use canned salmon). Pulling out the insides of the bread makes a nice pocket for the filling. Use those bread pieces to make breadcrumbs or croutons.</p><h2>Anti-Inflammatory Chicken & Beet Salad</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1jtOUO_a_recipe_photo_of_the_chicken_beet_salad.jpg" alt="a recipe photo of the Chicken & Beet Salad"><figcaption><em>Photographer: Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Melissa Gray, Prop Stylist: Shell Royster.

Buying packaged cooked beets cuts down on time (and mess!). Look for them in the produce section where other prepared vegetables are sold.</p><h2>Sweet Potato Curry</h2><p>The tomato rounds out the curry paste and adds body to this vegan sweet potato curry. A touch of garam masala at the end adds warm flavors.</p><h2>Red Lentil Soup with Saffron</h2><p>This hearty red lentil soup uses spices common in Persian cuisine: turmeric, cumin and saffron. Enjoy it with a warm baguette or steamed rice.</p><h2>Arugula & Cucumber Salad with Tuna</h2><p>Spicy baby arugula pairs with crisp Persian cucumbers and celery in this refreshing salad. Italian Castelvetrano olives offer a mild, buttery flavor that doesn't compete with the flavor of the tuna. If you want more punch from your olives, Niçoise olives or Kalamata olives work well too.</p><h2>Kale, Quinoa & Apple Salad</h2><p>This kale, quinoa and apple salad is perfect for fall. Fresh apples bring crisp autumn flavor, and the kale breaks down when it's massaged with the dressing. Nuts, fennel and quinoa add more layers of texture, while blue cheese lends a savory note.</p><h2>Lemony Shrimp, Kale & Potato Salad</h2><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1aBkb5_lemony_shrimp_kale_potato_salad.jpg" alt="Lemony Shrimp, Kale & Potato Salad"><figcaption><em>Leigh Beisch. Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hearty kale and potatoes put a seasonal spin on a Greek-style salad featuring feta, olives and cherry tomatoes. Russet potatoes absorb flavor like a sponge, making them a great choice for salads with flavorful vinaigrettes like this one.</p><h2> Fish Tacos with Preserved Grapefruit Salsa</h2><p>Tart preserved grapefruit and fresh grapefruit segments combine with avocado to make a complex salsa that pairs nicely with fish.</p><h2>Tuna Macaroni Salad</h2><p>This simple tuna and macaroni salad is easy to pack and enjoy for work or school. The celery and bell pepper add a refreshing crisp crunch while the dressing, packed with flavor from dill, Dijon and lemon juice, complements the tuna.</p><h2>Anti-Inflammatory Beet & Avocado Wrap</h2><p>Packed with fiber and monounsaturated fats, avocados are one of the best foods to eat to fight inflammation. Combined with beets, which contain their own inflammation-fighting phytochemicals, you'll get a lunch that packs a healthy punch. The tahini-lemon mixture adds brightness and a nutty flavor to the wrap. To julienne beets, cut them into thin rounds, then slice the rounds into matchsticks. Or to save time, simply grate the beets on the largest holes of a box grater.</p><h2>Orzo Salad with Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Feta & Olives</h2><p>This Greek-inspired orzo salad has just the right amount of tartness from red-wine vinegar and just a hint of sweetness. Fresh veggies give it crunch and texture.</p><h2>Cucumber & Roasted Red Pepper Hummus Wrap</h2><p>This easy vegetarian wrap makes a great grab-and-go lunch for work or school. Roasted red pepper hummus adds color and a little extra flavor, but any flavor hummus will work well here. Cucumber, sprouts, salad greens or spinach all add a refreshing crunch. For a peppery kick, try using arugula.</p><h2>Cucumber & Avocado Wrap</h2><p>Creamy avocado and cooling cucumber combine with a spicy mayonnaise mixture and peppery arugula in this easy vegetarian wrap. If you like the heat, add additional Sriracha or try it with chile-garlic sauce. For a cooler wrap, you can cut back on the Sriracha or leave it out completely, swapping out the arugula for baby spinach.</p></main>
