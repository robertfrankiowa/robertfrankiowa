    <main><h1>I Lost 90 Pounds in 2 Years by Running and These Major Changes</h1><p>Do you want to lose weight, the natural way? Antania Perry is a weight loss warrior who transformed her life and health with a few simple lifestyle changes. After a health scare, the mother-of-two decided to embark on a weight loss journey, and has lost 90 pounds in 2 years and is still going. The Detroit-based clinical therapist is also a NASM certified personal trainer, and started a company, Self Evolved Fitness, in order to help others lose weight holistically. She recently sat down with Body Network to tell her story.</p><h2>1 A Near Death Experience Made Her Change Her Life</h2><p>Antania's weight loss journey began two years ago after a near-death experience made her change her entire way of living. "In December of 2021, I got COVID-19 while 35 weeks pregnant, was in the ICU, and couldn't breathe on my own or move my body what-so-ever. I was 25 years old and 320 pounds. I had to have my baby via emergency c-section, coded while giving birth, and could not hold my son for the first 3 days of his life," she tells us.</p><figure><img title="1 A Near Death Experience Made Her Change Her Life" src="IMG/BB1kysmR_1_a_near_death_experience_made_her_change_her_life.jpg" alt="1 A Near Death Experience Made Her Change Her Life"><figcaption><em>1 A Near Death Experience Made Her Change Her Life. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 She Lost Almost 100 Pounds in 2 Years</h2><p>"This is what made me turn my life around and change my perspective on many things," she continues. "Over the last 2 years, I lost nearly 100 pounds, gained healthy habits, shifted my way of thinking with weight and a sense of self."</p><h2>3 She Changed Her Mind, "And My Body Followed</h2><p>Now a certified personal trainer, as well as a therapist, she blends together her expertise to create a mind and body approach to weight loss and holistic fitness training. "I had to change my mind and my body followed, this part of weight loss sometimes gets overlooked. It is more of a mental journey than a physical one. I am now dedicating my life to empower others on their wellbeing journey," she says.</p><figure><img title="3 She Changed Her Mind, " and="" my="" body="" followed"="" src="IMG/BB1oMFOw_3_she_changed_her_mind_and_my_body_followed.jpg" alt="3 She Changed Her Mind, " and="" my="" body="" followed"=""><figcaption><em>3 She Changed Her Mind, "And My Body Followed. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Subhead Goes Right Here</h2><p>Strength training, including core and stability training, were a key part of her approach to exercise. Here are her top 5 strength training exercises:</p><p>— Lat Pull Downs</p><p>— Bent dumbbell over rows</p><p>— Romanian deadlift</p><p>— Bulgarian split squats</p><p>— Kettlebell walking lunges</p><h2>5 Pilates</h2><p>Pilates are another workout Antania relied on. Why is pilates a good workout? According to the Mayo Clinic there are lots of benefits to the workout, as it "strengthens the body's inner core while increasing its flexibility resulting in improved overall health." It can also promote longer, leaner muscles, injury prevention, relief from stress and back pain, enhanced athletic performance, and heightened mind-body awareness.</p><h2>6 Running and Stairmaster</h2><p>She also attributes her weight loss to running and the stairmaster. According to the Mayo Clinic, running is great for cardiovascular health, muscle building, and weight loss. "For every mile run, the average person will burn approximately 100 calories," they say.</p><h2>7 She Faced Setbacks</h2><p>Antania faced many significant fitness challenges and setbacks along the way. "I struggled with disordered eating the majority of my life, and it has been extremely hard tackling weight loss while changing my mindset on how I view food," she says. "What has helped me is staying consistent, forming better day to day habits, and therapy. Realizing that fitness and wellness are lifelong and not just short-term things."</p><h2>8 Plant-Based Diet</h2><p>Antania has been plant-based/vegan for the majority of her journey for the last two years. "For the last 6 months, I began to incorporate some seafood for additional protein to hit my target macros," she says. "My typical diet is striving to consume foods with more nutritional value, listening to my body, and taking the 'good or bad' label off of foods. I am also mindful of my calorie and protein consumption."</p><figure><img title="8 Plant-Based Diet" src="IMG/BB1oNVzq_8_plant_based_diet.jpg" alt="8 Plant-Based Diet"><figcaption><em>8 Plant-Based Diet. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 She Avoids Dairy, Eggs, and Meat</h2><p>She also eliminated a few things from her diet. "I choose not to eat dairy products, eggs, or meat. However, do what fits your lifestyle," she encourages. "You should strive for 'what foods can I add to my diet mindset.'"</p><h2>10 You Don't Need to "Go on a Diet"</h2><p>"A fitness myth that I once believed was that you need to go on a diet to lose weight," Antania reveals. "95% of diets fail because it is not sustainable. It is truly a lifestyle change."</p><h2>11 Supplements</h2><p>Antania also takes a few supplements. She says that protein powder and multivitamins are part of her daily approach to health.</p><h2>12 She Doesn't Buy Into Health Trends</h2><p>She also doesn't buy into fitness or health trends. "It seems that people are taking an honest look at the fitness industry and there are some good creators who give evidence based data and research to support the information they share online," she says.</p><h2>13 She Tracks Her Progress</h2><p>Antania has a few ways that she measures progress in her  body goals. They include weighing herself on the scale, taking measurements and photos, and seeing how her clothes fit.</p><h2>14 She Practices Gratitude</h2><p>What other health habits keep her motivated? "Practicing gratitude and getting enough sleep," she says. She also thinks positively. "For each negative thought I have about my body I replace it with a positive one," she says. Positive affirmations and watching uplifting videos are helpful.</p><h2>15 Self-Love Is Her "Biggest Achievement"</h2><p>"Loving my body at each phase while losing weight is my biggest achievement when it comes to my body. The self love that I have gained is irreplaceable," she says.</p><figure><img title="15 Self-Love Is Her " biggest="" achievement""="" src="IMG/BB1oMFOV_15_self_love_is_her_biggest_achievement.jpg" alt="15 Self-Love Is Her " biggest="" achievement""=""><figcaption><em>15 Self-Love Is Her "Biggest Achievement". © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>16 Train Your Mind and Body, She Urges</h2><p>"My number 1 tip for someone to get similar results is to train your mind and your body simultaneously. Move your body throughout the day (5-10k steps daily), Calorie deficit for your body and goals, increase protein, and having a strength training program is the recipe for real results," she says.</p><h2>17 She Is Her Own Fitspiration</h2><p>Who is her fitspiration? "My fitness inspiration is myself and keeping in mind how far I have come and the WHY. The reason I do the hard things is for my health and soul," says Antania. She also reveals that she follows Eric Roberts on social media. "His content is wonderful, educational, and inspiring," she says.</p><h2>18 Give Yourself Grace</h2><p>What is her advice for someone just starting their fitness journey? "Give yourself grace, have a plan, and surround yourself with great people and accountability. Walk more, plan your meals, and hire a trainer you trust," she says.</p><h2>19 She Still Has 40 Pounds to Go</h2><p>Antania went from 320 pounds to 230, and she still hopes to lose 40 more. "I lost weight all over, and I am shocked by how much my face has changed," she says.</p><h2>20 "The Secret of Your Future Is Hidden in Your Daily Routine."</h2><p>Her favorite motivational quote when it comes to fitness comes from Mike Murdock. "The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine."</p></main>
