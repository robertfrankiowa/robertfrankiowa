It can influence the demand – or lack thereof – for specific goods, services, and infrastructure. In the case of seniors, health may be an indicator of longevity and overall well-being, dictating how insurance products and retirement planning should be laid out.</p><p>With this in mind, SmartAsset ranked all states (except for Florida, for which data was not available) on health metrics across the population aged 65 and older, including obesity, smoking, arthritis, mental distress, disability status and more, to find where seniors are healthiest.</p><h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3><ul>  <li><strong>New Hampshire seniors are healthiest.</strong> Just over 83% of people aged 65 and older in New Hampshire claim their health to be "good" or "excellent." The state ranks in the top 10 for every attribute of senior health, from obesity to smoking to mental health.</li>  <li><strong>Hawaiian seniors have the lowest rates of obesity.</strong> Hawaii ranked second overall for healthy seniors, thanks in part to only 16.6% of seniors qualifying as obese. Colorado, which ranked eighth overall, has the second-lowest rate of obesity at 23.0%.</li>  <li><strong>Colorado seniors have a relatively high rate of cognitive decline.</strong> Colorado generally ranks among the top 10 for most attributes across senior health, but second-to-last when it comes to experiencing cognitive decline (15.6%, compared to 16.2% in Tennessee). On the other hand, Colorado has the lowest disability rate for seniors (21.5%), as well as the highest rate of seniors participating in physical activity in their leisure time (78.5%). </li>  <li><strong>Seniors are least healthy in these southern states.</strong> Louisiana ranked last for senior health, with Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee following closely. In particular, West Virginia seniors ranked worst for both obesity (36%) and number of days spent with mental distress (12.6 days), while Tennessee has the most senior smokers (15%) and those experiencing cognitive decline (16.2%).</li>  <li><strong>Utah has the lowest rate of senior smokers.</strong> Only 4% of the population aged 65 and older partakes in smoking. Illinois (6.2%) and Connecticut (6.7%) also had relatively few smokers in this age bracket.</li> </ul><figure><img title="SmartAsset" src="IMG/BB1i393k_top_10_states_with_the_healthiest_seniors.jpg" alt="Top 10 states with the healthiest seniors"><figcaption><em>table showing 49 states where seniors are the healthiest.
