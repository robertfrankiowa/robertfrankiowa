Provided by Shape</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new lululemon survey reveals a “well-being paradox,” in which we say we want to be healthier…but are actually getting less so. Here’s how to overcome this contradiction so you can live stronger and longer.</p><p>Whether it’s setting an ambitious New Year’s resolution to work out first thing 5 days per week or vowing that you’re going to order the salad when you dine out with friends after work, many of us have had best-laid health plans…only to not stick to them. Hey, we get it: The call of the snooze button or the burger and fries is strong some days, and life is meant to be enjoyed, too.</p><p>But this chasm between intention and action is far from an isolated event—and the ripple effect of that dichotomy is making us feel wildly defeated, according to findings from lululemon’s 2023 Global Well-Being Report. The athleisure brand began releasing annual reports in 2021 to try to summarize how about 14,000 adults from around the globe feel about their physical, mental, and social health. </p><p>You might guess that since it was prime pandemic time, the collective responses in 2021 would have been at least optimistic, especially since we’re having far more conversations about holistic health, and inclusivity and have more resources than ever to disseminate wellness-related information.</p><p>However, one in three respondents to lululemon’s 2023 survey admit that their well-being is actually at its lowest point in their lifetime—even though more than 67 percent rank their health as a top priority. In fact, a mere 12 percent of those surveyed feel that their well-being is “where it should be.” </p><p>So why is there such a disparity between where we are and where we want to be wellness-wise, and how can we move the needle without overhauling our lives? We spoke with a trainer, dietitian, and psychiatrist for answers.</p><h2>What is Well-Being? And How Well Are We, Really?</h2><p>This might seem like a cut-and-dry Q&A, but even Gail Saltz, MD, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill-Cornell Medical College in New York City and the host of the <em>How Can I Help?</em> podcast from iHeartRadio acknowledges that “it’s complicated.”</p><p>Oxford English Dictionary defines “well-being” as “general health and happiness” in emotional, physical, and psychological arenas. That multifactorial aspect is clutch, Corey Lewis, CPT, CSCS, a New York City-based former professional football player, certified personal trainer, and co-founder of the mental health and wellness app 1AND1 tells <em>SHAPE</em>. “People often focus solely on physical health while neglecting their mental and emotional well-being,” he says. “Mental health and physical health are interconnected, so neglecting one can have a negative impact on the other.”</p><p>If you don't have mental well-being, meaning you are struggling with low mood, high anxiety, or some other stressor, you don't feel well, explains Dr. Saltz. Those sentiments spill over into how social you feel like being and how you move and fuel your body.“When people prioritize well-being, they often don't mean getting treatment for mental health issues, they mean eating a more balanced diet, sleeping better, exercising more, or these days, following a TikTok trend of ‘wellness,’” says Dr. Saltz.</p><p>That last aspect creates a big wrinkle since there is potential for so much misinformation that might not be helping you. TikTok trends may, in fact, be harming you—or at least might be poaching your precious time and money while making you believe you’re doing something positive for your well-being when you’re not. (Ahem, “weight loss dance” and dry scooping…)</p><p>“I think this dilemma is related to lack of access to<em> real</em> science-based information, access to good treatment, and having too much negative reality in life,” says Dr. Saltz.  The comparison trap online is also all too real, adds Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD, a Miami-based board-certified sports dietitian.</p><p>Back in 2021, people felt that the pandemic could help explain their mental, physical, and emotional health challenges in some ways. As the stay-at-home restrictions and immediate virus-related health threats eased, we’d feel better, right? </p><p>But in 2023, “there is no longer the belief that the pandemic is responsible for the extreme stresses many people face, whether they are financial, racial, cultural, relational or political,” says Dr. Saltz. “Those stresses are still there, but they are the current ‘normal,’ so there is not an anticipation of reprieve and there is still the impact on mental and physical health.”</p><p><p>lululemon’s research bears this out. Just over four in 10 respondents claim that they feel hopeless about the state of the world. Several barriers stand between themselves and making their wellness goals a reality, according to the report: </p><ul><li>30 percent say they lack enough time to think about and implement well-being-boosters</li><li>51 percent are diminishing their wellness goals because they’re too expensive to keep up</li><li>39 percent feel too much pressure to follow societal norms, which is hampering their mental health</li><li>58 percent believe they’re not their “best selves” when their well-being is lackluster</li></ul><p>As a result of less-than-stellar physical, emotional, or psychological wellness, the average respondent has missed 5 days of work or 7 days of school over the course of the past 12 months. “It <em>does</em> take time and money to implement many of the common healthy habits, and many people are stretched to their limits. Many people are financially strapped. Plus we’re spending a lot of time on social media, which mostly detracts from mental well-being. It’s also highly addictive, so it's difficult to cut that out to have more time for real and helpful attention,” says Dr. Saltz, on wellness goals or anything else that’s important to you.</p><h2>7 Ways to Boost Your Well-Being (Even When Times Are Tough)</h2><p>There are signs of progress and hope, though, and those who report they are rocking their overall well-being can give us some cues about how we can all make our ambitions a reality…for real this time. Here are some strategies to try out if you're looking to boost your well-being.</p><h3>Team Up</h3><p>Exercise with others when possible, and when you can’t, try flipping on some positive tunes to push you forward. “Movement can help boost your endorphins, powerful feel-good hormones, which can help support a better mental outlook,” explains Ehsani. Other people help keep you accountable. “Loneliness takes a major toll on well-being, and exercising with others can very much help,” adds Dr. Saltz. </p><h3>Carve Out Time For Your Inner Circle</h3><p>lululemon’s survey reveals that about 40 percent of those in the highest well-being category are spending more time with loved ones than pre-pandemic. Those in the lowest wellness ranks? About 30 percent. “Quality relationships are what fights loneliness; a major public health issue. Close relationships are a top priority for happiness,” says Dr. Saltz.</p><h3>Be Honest</h3><p>Expressing all emotions, not just the positive ones, is another key differentiator where the well-being winners stand out, lululemon found. Being able to talk about distressing feelings offers relief from the burden, and might spur you on to seek professional support if you need it.</p><p>According to Dr. Saltz, “Keeping your emotions under wraps tends to make you feel more isolated, alone, and worse overall.” If you find that you’re experiencing any symptoms of depression, experience high levels of anxiety, or would simply like an unbiased source to talk things out with, seek out a credentialed psychologist or psychiatrist, Dr. Saltz recommends. Consider one of these 8 online therapy services, or keep these tips in mind for how to find budget-friendly therapy near you (or digitally).</p><h3>Set Better Goals</h3><p>Are you not sticking to your health goals because they’re simply not the right health goal for you? “The key lies in building strong habits that align with your goals. By creating a solid foundation of healthy routines, you'll develop laser-like focus and be able to navigate through any distractions that come your way,” says Lewis. Skip the SMART goals this time and instead find a FUN goal that aligns with your aims.</p><h3>Prioritize Produce</h3><p>An April 2018 study in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> suggests that eating more fruits and vegetables might help improve your mood. If you’re feeling a bit low, try adding just one more serving each of fruits and vegetables into your day, such as a side of Brussels sprouts with dinner or a bowl of berries at snacktime, Ehsani advises. “Once you've successfully added at least one of each into your day, try to keep this up. When you feel like you’ve mastered this, start shooting for two servings of fruit and two servings of veggies each day,” she says.</p><h3>Derail Distractions</h3><p>As we mentioned, social media <em>can</em> sidetrack your intentions, but it can also offer a way to connect with others, find recipe inspiration or simply wind down. So you need not delete every app. Instead, “have a plan for each type of distraction you may have. One way to avoid being distracted from your goals is to use apps that help minimize the time spent on your phone,” Lewis says. Try an app like one sec, AppBlock or simply adjust the time limit settings within your specific apps you tend to overuse.</p><p>A long and strong life is a marathon, not a sprint. Try to be patient with yourself, and try to notice and commemorate small victories along the way. “Change takes time and consistency,” Lewis confirms. “Think about becoming just 1 percent better every day rather than trying to overhaul your entire routine.”</p><p>By adopting a holistic approach to health—with an eye to mental, physical and social well-being—implementing these expert-approved tips, you’ll be well on your way to a healthier and happier 2024.</p>
