    <main><h1>Is Anxiety a Side Effect of Obesity?</h1><p><p>Anxiety and obesity are two different health conditions that can sometimes occure together. Over 19% of American adults experience an anxiety disorder. More than double that, over 42% of American adults experience obesity. The relationship between anxiety and obesity may vary by person.</p><p>Learn about the connection between obesity and anxiety, risk factors, how to manage anxiety while having obesity, and more.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pG3XC_woman_sitting_on_edge_of_bed.jpg" alt="Woman sitting on edge of bed"><figcaption><em>Dmitrii Marchenko / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Connection Between Obesity and Anxiety</h2><p>The relationship between anxiety and obesity varies by individual. One condition can lead to the other, both conditions can be attributed to a third condition, or obesity and anxiety can occur on their own.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Anxiety may lead to emotional eating (i.e. eating to cope with negative emotions), which can contribute to obesity.</li><li>Experiencing obesity and related societal pressures may increase levels of stress and anxiety.</li><li>The types of foods eaten, such as processed food and food high in sugar, may lead to both anxiety and obesity.</li></ul><p>However, the details of these relationships, and the causes, are unclear and vary by person.</p><p>Studies have shown that people who consume more sugary, fried, and processed foods are more likely to experience both anxiety and obesity, but this does not show that one causes the other, and there may be other variables.Everyone is different, and when anxiety and obesity happen together, there may be multiple things that contribute to the health concerns.</p><h2>Risks of Having Anxiety and Obesity</h2><p>Anxiety has been found to be a risk factor for obesity, and obesity has been found to be a risk factor for anxiety. This means that having one can increase your chance of developing the other. The risks of anxiety and obesity are different for everyone.</p><p>Obesity may increase the risk of anxiety because of worries related to the effects it has on health or experiencing weight stigma. Anxiety may increase the risk of obesity when food is consumed as a way to cope with unpleasant feelings, the effect of stress hormones on increased appetite and cravings, and more. Despite the risks, there are ways to prevent and manage both medical conditions.</p><h2>How to Manage Ongoing Anxiety With Obesity</h2><p>There are many ways to manage ongoing anxiety with obesity. For example, eating fewer total calories per day has been shown to decrease anxiety among people who are obese. The types of foods that are eaten is important, too. Eating fewer sugary, fried, and processed foods can help to manage both anxiety and obesity.</p><p>Getting enough quality sleep, exercising or moving the body such as by walking or stretching, and positive social interactions can also help to manage anxiety with obesity.</p><h2>Anxiety and Obesity Medical TreatmentÂ </h2><p>Many healthy lifestyle choices can help to treat both anxiety and obesity. For example, exercise and regularly moving the body can lower stress and anxiety levels, help to reach a healthy weight, and decrease the risk of many diseases such as type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, among many other benefits. There are also medications that can be used along with healthy lifestyle choices to treat both anxiety and obesity.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing anxiety, obesity, or both, reach out to a healthcare provider such as a primary care practitioner for support.</p><p><p>Body mass index (BMI) is a dated, biased measure that does not account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age. Despite being a flawed measure, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.</p><p>Some strategies to help reach a healthy weight include:</p><ul><li>Prioritizing getting enough quality sleep</li><li>Focusing on eating fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, whole grains, and other unprocessed, whole foods</li><li>Engaging in regular physical activity such as yoga or walking</li><li>Limiting sugary, fried, or processed foods and alcohol</li><li>Manage stress throughout the day</li><li>Spend time with and talk to supportive friends and family members</li><li>Seek professional support</li></ul><h2>Better Snacking With Obesity and Anxiety</h2><p>Reducing certain foods may seem daunting, but it doesn't have to be. It can help to focus on the foods that promote health and help to manage obesity and anxiety instead of focusing on the foods to be limited. Foods that have been found to reduce anxiety include:</p><ul><li>Asparagus</li><li>Avocado</li><li>Cashews</li><li>Salmon</li><li>Sauerkraut</li></ul><p>These foods are not heavily processed and are also low in sugar, making them great options for people with obesity.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Anxiety and obesity can sometimes occur together, and each has been shown to increase the risk of the other. A direct relationship between the two medical conditions is unclear, and it is different for everyone. Anxiety may lead to overeating to cope with emotions that indirectly increase weight, and experiencing obesity and related societal pressures can increase stress and anxiety levels. Hormones and cravings can also affect the relationship between anxiety and obesity.</p><p>It can be challenging to experience anxiety and obesity separately, and even more challenging when they happen together. There are many ways to manage these conditions, such as by eating fruits, vegetables, and whole foods; exercising regularly; or taking medications. Reach out to a healthcare professional, such as a primary care provider, for support.</p>
