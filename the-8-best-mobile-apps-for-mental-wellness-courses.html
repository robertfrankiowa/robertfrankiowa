Provided by MUO</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking after your mental health and wellness is important if you want to not only cope with everyday life but make the most out of it. If you fail to maintain your mental health and wellness you'll likely struggle to handle daily stressors—both at home and at work.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a range of mobile apps where you can access anything from meditation practices and ambient music to bedtime stories and a selection of self-care tools. Moreover, these apps include mental health and wellness programs, classes, and courses. Read on to find out what they have to offer.</p><h2>       1. Mindvalley     </h2><p>Mindvalley boasts over 100 wellness programs, whether you want to improve your body, relationships, soul, career, entrepreneurship, or mind. For mental health and wellness-related programs, it's best that you select <strong>Mind</strong>. From there you can choose what aspect of your mind you want to work on—for instance, your happiness or quality of life.</p><p>Mindvalley then recommends programs or "quests" that are ideal for you. If you're not 100% happy with these programs, you have the option to browse by category and simply find a program yourself. Alternatively, you can customize your goals further to get a better result. When you do find a suitable program, you can view a breakdown of the teacher, lessons, resources, and the overall curriculum.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Mindvalley for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       2. Headspace     </h2><p>Headspace is one of the best meditation apps for relaxing and sleeping. So it is no surprise that the app features plenty of mental health and wellness programs and courses. A must-try beginner program is Managing Stress, which is led by Kessonga. This program is made up of four parts spread out over four weeks.</p><p>Each session only takes about 10 minutes a day, yet it can help you manage your stress. This is vital, as stress can put you at increased risk for a variety of physical and mental health problems, according to an article from the American Psychological Association. Additionally, Headspace provides a large library of meditation courses and single sessions.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Headspace for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       3. Calm     </h2><p>Often labeled the number one app for mindfulness and meditation, Calm is straightforward to use and full of content. The content varies, but overall it focuses on meditations, music, soundscapes, breathing exercises, and sleep stories for kids and adults. However, that content also includes free courses on topics like mindfulness, happiness, anxiety, gratitude, and self-esteem.</p><p>According to an article from the Anxiety & Depression Association of America, practicing gratitude can increase your happiness and well-being. 7 Days of Gratitude, taught by the head of mindfulness at Calm Tamara Levitt, is an excellent course to start with. The only downside about Calm's courses is that they are quite tricky to find. The best way to go about finding them is to simply type "course" into the search bar.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Calm for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       4. Insight Timer     </h2><p>From journaling and yoga to live events and music tracks, Insight Timer has it all. Moreover, Insight Timer offers over 3,000 courses—and over 1,000 more with a Premium subscription—as well as a handy <strong>New Courses</strong> button on the Home tab.</p><p>You can filter through the massive library of courses based on how long, highly rated, or popular they are. On the other hand, you can filter through them using a variety of topics, including recovery and healing, health and happiness, sleep, and love.</p><p>What topic you decide on all depends on what area of your mental health and wellness you want to focus on. Tap on each course to see an overview of the daily lessons, watch previews, or read reviews from other learners.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Insight Timer for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       5. Remente     </h2><p>Remente is a mobile app aimed at improving mental health and wellness using aspects like a daily agenda, goal tracking, journaling, and a ton of resources, including courses. Compared to other apps, Remente's courses are fairly basic. But you do have the option to choose whether you'd like to listen to each class or read through the lesson text yourself.</p><p>It is also important to note that Remente's courses are a little difficult to find among all the other articles and exercises. However, all it takes is a little browsing, and you'll find some must-try courses, like 7 Steps for a More Wonderful Life and 3 Great Ways to Handle Stress.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Remente for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       6. My Possible Self     </h2><p>My Possible Self is a mental health app that covers topics such as sleep, anxiety, stress, depression, and lots more.</p><p>The app's courses—or what they like to call guided series—are based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. According to an article from the National Health Service, cognitive behavioral therapy can be an effective way to treat different mental health conditions.</p><p>All the guided series consists of an introduction video followed by a range of different course content, some of which include tools, self-assessments, guidelines, and various learning materials and information.</p><p>My Possible Self recommends going through all of them at your own pace, although some, such as Gambling Safely or Men's Mental Health, might not apply to everyone.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> My Possible Self for iOS | Android (Free)</p><h2>       7. Wellness Coach     </h2><p>With regard to mental health and wellness programs for your mind and the body, Wellness Coach's selection is limited but impressive. The app features a library full of curated plans from Andy Lee's 33-step program on how to become a mindful leader to Corene Summer's quick 5-step plan on how to manage your stress.</p><p>Each program begins with a pre-assessment followed by a breakdown of all the levels and steps. Plus, you can track your time, progress, and how effective the program is as you advance through it. Alternatively, Wellness Coach offers a fitness plan to help you train for your next 5K race and a yoga program to learn the basics of yoga.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Wellness Coach for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       8. Intellect     </h2><p>The Intellect app's courses or Learning Paths are lovely to look at, easy to use, and straightforward to complete. Using these Learning Paths, you can enhance your mental health and wellness with interesting courses like Building Your Self-Esteem and Communicating Your Needs.</p><p>What's more, many of them only include a few sessions and a couple of check-ins, which means you can get through the learning material in a few hours or spread them out over a few days. Intellect also lets you switch between audio mode and text mode, which is a nice option to have when it comes to courses.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>Intellect for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)</p><h2>       It Is Time to Build Better Mental Health and Wellness     </h2><p>There are an impressive amount of apps available that can assist you with mental wellness, whether you're looking for quick meditations and sleep stories or full courses, classes, programs, paths, and series.
