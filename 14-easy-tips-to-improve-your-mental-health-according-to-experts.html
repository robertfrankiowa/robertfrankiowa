Don’t be afraid to respectfully set boundaries with others, and tell them when you just can’t offer support at the time.</p><figure><img title="Establish healthy boundaries" src="IMG/BB1mFf2w_establish_healthy_boundaries.jpg" alt="Establish healthy boundaries"><figcaption><em>Establish healthy boundaries.

At times, the simple act of going outside, possibly spending some time in nature, can make a massive difference. Put on your shoes, grab your keys, and head to the nearest park for a leisure stroll. Once you return home, note how your mood has changed. </p><h2>Journal</h2><p>Journaling is a great way to shut down the thousands of voices in your head and bring more clarity to your life. Consider this a form of therapy—a way to share your thoughts and worries with someone whenever you need it. A final tip: when writing, simply focus on your stream of thought instead of concentrating on grammar and syntax. </p></main>
