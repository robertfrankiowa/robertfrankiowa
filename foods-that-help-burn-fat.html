    <main><h1>Foods That Help Burn Fat</h1><h2>Fatty Fish</h2><p>Fish are high in omega-3s, and the more omega-3s in your diet, the better your body will run. Not only will eating them improve your heart health, but it will help you maintain a regular sleeping pattern as well. Although omega-3 is considered a fat, it is actually a healthy fat that your body and brain need and can use more efficiently than other fats. Regular sleep helps your body run more efficiently, which will help in meeting your weight-loss goals. Fish also contain protein, which makes you feel fuller and pushes your body to burn more fat.</p><figure><img title="Fatty Fish" src="IMG/BB1o22nN_fatty_fish.jpg" alt="Fatty Fish"><figcaption><em>Fatty Fish.

By avoiding processed versions of grains and sticking to what is natural, you are granting your body the ability to break down foods much more efficiently. On top of this, eating high-fiber grains allows your system to burn a lot more calories throughout the digestive process.</p><figure><img title="Whole Grains" src="IMG/BB1nXuvD_whole_grains.jpg" alt="Whole Grains"><figcaption><em>Whole Grains.

They boost up your metabolism so that your body burns off a good portion of the food itself during the digestive process. Lean meats are great for improving your body’s overall production and are a good source of protein for any diet.</p><h2>Almonds And Other Nuts</h2><p>Nuts are known for increasing one’s mood and regulating sleep patterns, both of which will help your body’s overall productivity. The more productive things are running, the better your system will be at breaking down fats. Also, their mood-boosting ability downplays the likelihood of experiencing cravings, helping you in keeping full control over your dietary choices.</p><h2>Dairy Products</h2><p>Milk, yogurt, and other foods high in calcium have been shown to help reduce cramps and other types of soreness that your body may be feeling. With daily aches and pains out of the way, your body is left feeling well-rested and healthy and will then burn fat much more efficiently.  Also, calcium is well-known for building up strong bones, so incorporating it into your regular diet is great for firing up your weight-loss strategies.</p><figure><img title="Dairy Products" src="IMG/BB1o1Rcb_dairy_products.jpg" alt="Dairy Products"><figcaption><em>Dairy Products.

It is filled with antioxidants, which help keep your body’s defenses in check. It also sparks your metabolism, making it a great drink to have right before a work-out. By drinking multiple glasses throughout the day, you can help in speeding up your body’s calorie-burning abilities.</p><figure><img title="Green Tea" src="IMG/BB1o1TwA_green_tea.jpg" alt="Green Tea"><figcaption><em>Green Tea.
