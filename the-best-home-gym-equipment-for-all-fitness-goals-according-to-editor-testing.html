    <main><h1>The Best Home Gym Equipment For All Fitness Goals, According To Editor Testing</h1><p>These 17 pieces of editor-tested gear will help you achieve your workout goals, right from your own pad.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1hNPc9_the_best_home_gym_equipment_for_all_fitness_goals_according_to_editor_testing.jpg" alt="The Best Home Gym Equipment For All Fitness Goals, According To Editor Testing"><figcaption><em>Health / Marcus Millan. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you lift weights, run, stretch, or have another preferred method for exercise, the most important thing is that you make sure it's part of your routine. Research shows that in addition to helping you reach physique goals, <strong>exercising actually helps you live longer</strong>—so finding a way to do it is a great long-term choice.</p><p>If you’re not able to make it to a commercial gym, you can still reap the benefits of exercise by purchasing home gym equipment. According to Jacob Sharf, an in-home and corporate personal trainer, building a home gym is absolutely worth it, especially if it’s your only workout option. Hesh Elberger, a fitness trainer at Iron Culture Gym in North Bergen, New Jersey, agrees that you can <strong>get a good workout with a minimal amount of equipment,</strong> and you can even do it from the comfort of your own basement or garage. </p><p>To find the best workout gear to outfit your home gym, we tested a wide range of fitness products to make the best recommendations in 17 categories. We focused mainly on factors like <strong>ease of use, storage, durability, and overall value, </strong>as well as ease of <strong>assembly and grip quality </strong>when applicable. Whether you want cardio equipment, strength training gear, or anything in between, this list has you covered.</p><h3>Best Dumbbells: CAP Barbell Set of 2 Hex Rubber Dumbbell</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>Right from the start, we loved <strong>Cap Barbell Hex Rubber Dumbbells</strong> for their basic design, as opposed to flashier and more colorful options on the market. They’re also <strong>durable and reasonably priced</strong>. Made from solid cast iron with chrome-plated handles, we found them to be exceptionally <strong>comfortable and easy to use</strong>. The knurling on the handle helped us maintain a good grip, even when our hands were sweaty.</p><p>The dumbbells feature a rubber coating that proved to be particularly durable, and there was no damage at all when we dropped them on concrete. Additionally, they proved to be accurate to the weight listed, down to the ounce. The <strong>hexagon shape help prevent the dumbbells from rolling</strong> when they are put on the floor, and they’re available in 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60 pound options to provide a thorough workout for any fitness goal.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>The dumbbells aren’t adjustable, so if you want more weight you’ll have to buy more, which means more money spent and more space required for storage. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One pair of dumbbells </li><li><strong>Size: </strong>9.30 x 6.20 x 2.70 Inches (for 20 pound option)</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60 pound options</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Cast iron, chrome plated, rubber coating</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.8</li></ul><h3>Best Budget Dumbbells: BalanceFrom Rubber Encase Hex Dumbbell Pair</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>Although they’re not adjustable, a single pair of these dumbbells <strong>didn’t take up much space </strong>for us in testing, fitting neatly into a corner of the room. Additionally, the rubber encasing kept them perfectly protected when we dropped them directly onto concrete. They’re available in <strong>5-pound increments from 5-50 pounds</strong>, or you can purchase a 150-pound set, which includes 5-25 pound dumbbells and a rack to hold them. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>One thing to be mindful of with these dumbbells is that there is a bit of a disparity and some inaccuracy with some of the weights. While this is fairly normal with weights, one of the 10-pound weights was almost a full pound lighter, at 9.14 pounds.</p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One set of dumbbells, or rack set with 150 pounds of weights</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>11.18 x 9.06 inches </li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or rack with 150 total pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Cast metal, rubber coating</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating:</strong> 4.8</li></ul><h3>Best Adjustable Dumbbells: ETHOS 50 lb. Selectable Dumbbell</h3><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1hNYsV_dick.jpg" alt="Dick"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>   <strong>Buy at Dickssportinggoods.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Golfgalaxy.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>Adjustable dumbbells are a highly convenient way to access to more weights without having to turn your home into a commercial gym filled with dumbbells. <strong>Ethos 50 Pound Selectable Dumbbells </strong>provide a 5-50 pound weight range, adjustable in five-pound increments. The weights are made of a steel and plastic construction. We found them to be comfortable in our hands, with a girth that would accommodate both larger and smaller hands. They were easy to grip even when our hands were wet. </p><p>The smaller profile of these dumbbells takes up about as much space as a chair, and the storage rack was<strong> light and easy to move around</strong> while still being sturdy and secure. All you have to do to adjust the weight is to place them in the storage rack and twist a dial to change the weight, which we found to turn smoothly. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>There was mild rattling with these dumbbells during use, but it was nothing that made us feel that they were unsafe or poorly made. Sometimes it also took a bit of wiggling to get the dumbbells back into the storage rack. Another thing to be aware of is that while 50 pounds may be enough for beginners, more advanced lifters may not find this to be enough weight for them.</p><h2>Product Details:</h2><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Two 5-50 pound dumbbells, storage rack</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>Not listed </li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 5-50 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Steel and plastic </li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>5</li></ul><h3>Best Kettlebell: CAP Barbell Cast Iron Competition Kettlebell Weight</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>If you’re a CrossFitter or someone who loves implementing kettlebells into a workout, <strong>Cap Barbell’s Cast Iron Competition Kettlebell </strong>is our pick for you. We found the grip on this kettlebell to be the perfect combination of smooth and rough. It’s easy on the hands, but you won’t feel like you’ll lose your grip. Even compared to more expensive options, we found these kettlebells never got slippery when wet. </p><p>Made of cast-iron with no welds or seams, as well as an<strong> industrial coated powder finish,</strong> we found this kettlebell to be particularly durable in testing. They’re available in weights of 9, 13, 18, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 70, 80, and 88 pounds. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>The kettlebells are sold individually, and while they are a great value, the cost adds up if you want multiple weights. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One kettlebell</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>7.25 x 7.875 x 5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 9, 13, 18, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 70, 80, 88 pound increments</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Cast Iron</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.94</li></ul><h3>Best Adjustable Kettlebell: Bowflex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Target.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>Kettlebells can get a bit expensive when you have to purchase more than one. We liked <strong>Bowflex’s SelectTech 840 Kettlebell </strong>because it’s adjustable and budget-friendly without sacrificing quality. The compact design comes with six weight increments: 8, 12, 20, 25, 35, and 40 pounds. </p><p>A simple turn of the weight adjustment dial enables you to easily adjust the kettlebell. It’s made from composite and earned high marks for its durability. And unlike other adjustable weight options, we appreciate that this one is not bulky at all and<strong> takes up minimal space when not in use.</strong></p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>One drawback of these kettlebells was the grip. We felt they could have come with more of a textured feel to make them easier to hold onto while working out. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One adjustable kettlebell, with weights ranging from 8-40 pounds</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> ‎8.8 x 7 x 12.5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 40 pounds max</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Composite</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.6</li></ul><h3>Best Treadmill: Bowflex Treadmill 10</h3><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1hNKBS_amazon_bowflex_treadmill_10.jpg" alt="Amazon Bowflex Treadmill 10"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>If your preferred method of cardio is running on a treadmill, our pick is <strong>Bowflex’s Treadmill 10.</strong> It’s easy to operate and includes a handful of features that make it a stand-out product. The built-in user interface in an <strong>adjustable HD touchscreen</strong> enables you to track metrics, follow trainer-led videos, stream shows, experience outdoor settings, get virtual coaching, and play music through<strong> Bluetooth speakers</strong>. Do note, though, that some of these features require a JRNY membership. </p><p>You can adjust the incline up to 15% or set a 5% decline, which is rare in treadmills. You can also set the speed as high as 15 miles per hour. We like that it provides three separate ways to adjust the incline/decline and speed, with two number pads, two handlebars, and two handrails. Additionally, we found this option to be comfortable to use, with a spacious running belt that has <strong>great traction and shock absorption</strong>. We didn’t experience any rattling or shaking when running on this machine, and we love that it comes with a built-in fan.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>The treadmill proved difficult for us to assemble. For starters, it comes in a box that weighs more than 400 pounds, and the screen was a bit difficult to put together. For taller people it can also be a bit awkward to look down at the metrics while riding. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Treadmill, HD screen, metrics, fan, media shelf, Bluetooth HR armband</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>85 x 39.6 x 65.3</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 323 pounds assembled</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Not listed</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.63</li></ul><h3>Best Budget Treadmill: Sunny Health & Fitness Treadmill with Device Holder</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Target.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>For a budget-friendly treadmill that has less features but still left us impressed, the <strong>Sunny Health and Fitness Premium Folding Incline Treadmill </strong>is the way to go. It’s much easier to assemble than the Bowflex option, requiring only a few pieces be screwed together.</p><p>This is more of a no-frills option and is great for someone who just needs a treadmill. It doesn’t feature a lot of options, but you also don’t have to connect it to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to use it, though you can connect it to the brand’s app. Instead, you simply <strong>choose how many miles you want to run and then press go</strong>. The left handle allows you to start and stop the track, while the right handle gives you freedom to adjust the speed. The speed adjusts rather quickly, going from 4 to 9 miles per hour in just 24 seconds and then back down to 4.5 miles per hour in just 13 seconds. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>There’s a bit of noise when running on this treadmill, and in testing we found we needed subtitles if watching television while using it. Additionally, you can set up an incline, but you have to do it manually, which makes it less enticing. Lastly, while 9 miles per hour may be perfectly fine for beginners, more advanced runners may find it’s not enough speed. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Treadmill, digital monitor, app, pulse sensor, bottle holder</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>63 x 26.2 x 50.2 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 112 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Alloy steel</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4</li></ul><h3>Best Weight Bench: FLYBIRD Adjustable Bench</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>If you’re looking to maximize your home gym setup, a sturdy bench is an essential component. <strong>Flybird’s Adjustable Bench</strong> checked off a lot of boxes for us and earned its spot on our list during our testing. For starters, it’s easy to assemble and <strong>comes folded in one piece</strong>, and it’s also lightweight. Both the back of the bench and the seat are adjustable, with <strong>six back positions </strong>(19°, 32°, 44°, 58°, 76°, flat)  and <strong>four seat positions </strong>(9°, 17°, 26°) to give you the ability to do flat bench, incline bench, and shoulder presses at your own comfort level. </p><p>This option can also be folded and we found it to be particularly easy to carry when we needed to transport it. Despite its lighter weight, it is still made from commercial grade steel and has a 600-pound weight limit. The padding proved to be particularly comfortable.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>One thing to be mindful of with this option is that while it is sturdy when laying down on it, we found it wobbled slightly when we used it for exercises like step ups. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One bench with adjustable back and seat</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>42.3 x 15.1 x 16.5 inches </li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 23.89 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Commercial grade steel</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>5</li></ul><h3>Best Resistance Bands: Chareada Resistance Bands Set</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>If you don’t like to use barbells and dumbbells to get a workout, resistance bands are another great option, especially when you’re on the go. <strong>Chareada’s 23-Pack Resistance Bands</strong> were our best pick when it came to quality and affordability. These resistance bands are made with an eco-friendly natural latex and come with a surprising amount of gear inside, including loop bands, a glider disk for ab workouts, a jump rope, ankle anchor, door anchor, wrist guards, two styles of handles to attach to the tubes, and a microfiber towel. The color-coded bands come in weights of 10 (yellow), 20 (green), 30 (red), 40 (green), and 50 (black) pounds. </p><p>We found the main bands to be versatile and easy to use. Taller people should have no issue with them as they are plenty long, and shorter people can just wrap them around their wrist to decrease the length as needed. Everything is intuitive, including the attachments. Additionally, we found<strong> the handles had great cushioning </strong>and worked just as well with sweaty hands as they did with dry hands. A small <strong>travel pouch</strong> makes the set super compact and easy to put in a bag or a backpack. And as an added bonus, there’s no latex smell.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>We didn’t find much use for the microfiber towel.</p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>5 resistance tube bands, 5 durable resistance bands, 2 double sided core sliders, 2 handles, 2 ankle straps, 1 door anchor, 1 cooling towel, 2 wrist wraps, 2 carrying bags</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> ‎13.66 x 9.72 x 3.82 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Latex</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating</strong>: 5</li></ul><h3>Best Indoor Cycle: Bowflex Velocore Bike 16”</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Target.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>We were impressed by <strong>Bowflex’s Velocore Bike 16”</strong> for a few reasons. For starters, thanks to the stabilizers and mat, we didn’t experience any wobbling while using it, even when we transitioned from the seated to the standing position, increased our speed dramatically, or changed the resistance level. It also comes with a one-year membership to JRNY, providing a slew of ways to work out. While it didn’t come assembled, we found it was easy to put together and the instructions were helpful.</p><p>You can seamlessly hook your feet into the pedals of this bike with ease, and we found they stayed perfectly in place throughout our rides. Additionally, the display impressed us with its large size and the option to toggle the brightness and volume with ease. This bike also made it <strong>easy to track our workout metrics, such as time, distance, cadence, calorie burn rate, heart rate, and resistance level.</strong> You can measure heart rate with the included armband via Bluetooth. You also have the option to choose from recordings of actual trainers or an AI coach that talks you through the entire workout to help keep you engaged.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>Although the seat can be adjusted up or down as well as forward and back, the handlebars are completely stationary. However, they’re also designed to accommodate different hand positions, so you’ll be able to make them work for you. We also felt that the seat left something to be desired in terms of comfort and was comparable to a standard bike seat, causing some mild soreness for the first two or three workouts. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Stationary bike, digital screen, a mat</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>59.8 x 24.1 x 55.3</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 158.3 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Not listed</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>5</li></ul><h3>Best Budget Indoor Cycle: Schwinn 190 Upright Exercise Bike</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>If cycling is your preferred method of exercise for weight loss or aerobic purposes, we found <strong>Schwinn’s 190 Upright</strong> to be the way to do it from home without breaking the bank. We found the base is wider than the previous model and did a good job of avoiding wobbling even at maximum speeds. The bike comes with an included JRNY app subscription that’s compatible with your phone to allow you to control every aspect of the workout. This feature is particularly helpful for beginners who don’t know where to start, since it comes with instructor-led programs that offer insights into cadence, resistance, burn rate, foot positioning, hand placement, and posture. </p><p>Whereas the previous model only allowed you to mildly adjust the handlebars and move the seat slightly forward and back, with this model you can tilt and adjust the handlebars as well as tighten the handlebars and the seat. With a quick-lock seat adjustment, you can <strong>raise and lower the seat easily with one hand,</strong> even while in use. But what stood out to us with this model was the comfort of the seat. The adjustable foam comfort seat is slightly larger and more padded than the previous model.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>One place this option left us desiring a bit more was the display. When connected to the app, the screen of the display goes blank. Additionally, there’s no tablet holder, so if you want to watch something on your tablet while riding, you’ll block some of the display. It also can’t connect to your watch to track your vitals.</p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Adjustable seat, adjustable handlebars, water bottle holder, 7” LCD Display</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>Not listed</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: Not listed</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Not listed</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.7</li></ul><h3>Best Plyo Box: Ultra Fitness Gear Anti-Slip Wood 3-in-1 Plyo Box</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>For the plyometric exercise lover,<strong> Ultra Fitness Gear’s Plyo Box </strong>is a great way to get that workout in right from home. It’s available in small, medium, and large size options, but for our testing we used the smallest choice. We found it to have excellent stability, not moving or slipping even when used on grass. While the ¾-inch thick plywood is thinner than other models, the wood didn’t warp or buckle, even when jumped on. The boxes have also been tested to withstand weights of up to 450 pounds. </p><p>Additional features we appreciate with this box include the handle cutouts and how easy it was to lift and move. It’s also adjustable, ranging between heights of 12, 14, and 16 inches depending on how you rotate the box. Do be aware that the smaller size is quite small, making it a good choice for beginners, but not quite enough for intermediate or advanced users.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>This option is suited for beginners but isn’t ideal for more advanced users.</p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One plyometric box</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>16.7 x 15 x 5.5 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 15.49 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Plywood</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.9</li></ul><h3>Best Free-Standing Bag: FITVEN Freestanding Punching Bag</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>As far as reasonably priced free-standing punching bags go, the <strong>FITVEN Freestanding punching bag</strong> proved to be the best choice in our testing. The all-inclusive set features not only a freestanding punching bag but also a set of gloves. It’s easy to set up, with no additional tools required. It also features suction cups to keep the bag anchored to the ground. </p><p>In our experience, the suction cups kept the bag in place without having to add sand, though we did find it to move slightly with some punches, such as upper hits. With a <strong>height range of 47 to 73 inches</strong>, the bag is a good choice for every member of the family. We found it was neither too hard nor too soft, and the price is just right.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>As you get stronger, the suction cups on the bottom may not be enough to keep the bag secure on the floor.</p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Punching bag, gloves</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> ‎9.84 x 55.51</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 205</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel, EPE foam, faux leather</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.8</li></ul><h3>Best Exercise Mat: lululemon The Workout Mat 6mm</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Shop.lululemon.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p> We love <strong>Lululemon’s The Workout Mat </strong>for its quality material and amount of thickness. We’ve tested thinner options in the past, and we found the 6mm thickness of this mat provided more <strong>cushion and comfort</strong> when doing poses that put our joints directly into contact with the floor. At 71 inches long, the mat can accommodate taller people, even during fully extended yoga positions like a plank or downward facing dog. </p><p>The top layer of this mat is made with recycled PVB to eliminate waste, and it features a raised textural design for<strong> added traction</strong>. In testing, we found the texture provided great grip, even when our hands were sweaty. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>As is often the case with yoga mats, we found this option had a slight chemical odor at first, but fortunately it dissipated quickly. Additionally, although the 6mm thickness provides exceptional support and comfort for most exercises and yoga poses, it might not be enough for sessions that include extended time lying on your back. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One mat</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>26 x 71 inches </li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 4.4 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled PVB (Polyvinyl Butyral)</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.8</li></ul><h3>Best Ab Bench: XMark Fitness Adjustable Decline Ab Workout Bench</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p><strong>XMark’s Adjustable Decline Ab Workout Bench</strong> features 12 different levels of decline. The 14-gauge steel mainframe is durable and left us feeling secure and safe. The adjustability makes it a highly versatile choice for beginners and advanced lifters alike. </p><p>The bench also comes with an ergonomic leg holder with 4-inch contoured roller pads and 2.5-inch vinyl cushions. These comfort features combined with the decline option enable you to get into positions you wouldn’t be able to access without an ab bench. We highly recommend it, <strong>especially for advanced lifters </strong>who are looking to add new exercises to their routine. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting </h3><p>One drawback we found with this bench is that it cannot lie completely flat. While it is a decline bench, we feel that adding this ability would make it even more versatile. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Decline ab bench</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>61 x 20 x 47</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 38 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Alloy steel</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.8</li></ul><h3>Best Fitness Mirror: lululemon Studio The Mirror</h3><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/AA1hf4se_lululemon_mirror.jpg" alt="Lululemon Mirror"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><p>   <strong>Buy at Mirror.co</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It </h3><p>Mirror workouts provide a fun and novel way to get your exercise in at home. In particular, <strong>Lululemon’s The Mirror</strong> included a handful of features that made it stand out in our testing. It provides you with the option to do plenty of workouts as well as live classes. The app is able to recommend classes based on what you’ve done before, and it also offers 15-minute workouts. You can do workouts that are tailored to specific body parts, such as upper body or glutes and legs. </p><p>The best thing about this mirror is its versatility. There’s no shortage of workouts to choose from, including<strong> barre, kickboxing, dance studio, vinyasa, strength, and more.</strong> It also offers beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, and we found the instructors to be helpful and encouraging. Lastly, an added bonus is that when it’s not in use, this is a sleek and stylish mirror that adds to the overall aesthetic of whatever room you put it in.</p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>One tricky thing to be aware of with this mirror is that it needs to be near an outlet, so you might need to reconfigure your space. You also have to pair your phone with the mirror every time you want to do a workout. </p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>Mirror, mirror stand, mirror lens cap</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> 1.4 x 22.4 x 56 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 70 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Carbon steel frame</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>4.9</li></ul><h3>Best Foam Roller: Trigger Point Performance GRID 1.0 Foam Roller</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Target.com</strong>  </p><h3>Why We Like It</h3><p>You may be asking yourself, how different could one foam roller be from another? Well, we found the <strong>TriggerPoint Grid Patented Multi-Density Foam Massage Roller</strong> to impress us with its design, which is more forgiving and accommodating for beginners. We found it to have <strong>softer grooves</strong> than competing foam rollers, allowing it to work into muscle knots without overly digging in. We also found the shorter length worked well for rolling your inner legs. </p><p>The roller<strong> doesn’t take up much space, </strong>and we even used the inside to store things when we needed to. The firmer core of this foam roller is a hollow and plastic tube, which we felt gave us good control over how much pressure we applied. </p><h3>It’s Worth Noting</h3><p>The smaller profile of this foam roller may make it hard to target larger areas like your back.</p><h3>Product Details:</h3><ul><li><strong>What’s Included: </strong>One foam roller, exercise instructions on packaging</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>13.03 x 5.47 x 5.43 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 1.1 pounds</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Foam</li><li><strong>Our Overall Rating: </strong>5</li></ul><h2>More Home Gym Equipment to Consider</h2><ul><li>Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells: These dumbbells came fully assembled and were easy to use. With half pound increments between 5 and 52.5 pounds, they work well for every level of lifter. However, we felt that they wouldn’t work for people with smaller hands as the grips are a bit large. Also, the storage rack slipped off a few times during testing, which we feel poses a safety hazard during movement.</li><li>NordicTrack Commercial Studio Cycle: This bike is stable, and we found it to make minimal noise and keep the floor safe, even at higher speeds. It also offers a wide range of workouts and great locations to ride like Jamaica, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, as well as beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. That being said, we found the cushion on the seat to become uncomfortable on longer rides.</li><li>Tempo Suite: We liked the Tempo Suite Mirror for its core and barre classes, its super simple setup, and the fact that it lets you stream your own music. Additionally, we loved that with some weight classes, Tempo will check your form and alert you if you’re lifting too heavily. Unfortunately, we found the app to be pretty useless as it doesn’t stream to the mirror, and the heart monitor also felt cheap. </li></ul><h2>Our Testing Process</h2><p>To find the best home gym equipment, we spoke with several fitness experts to get their advice on which items are most essential for a good home workout. Because of the wide range of products on our list, we conducted unique research for each item, rating each product on a scale of one to five. Here are some of the qualities we considered for each home gym item:</p><ul><li><strong>Dumbbells: </strong>We tested each set 2-3 times a week for at least a month, using them for movements like bent over rows, curls, forward lunges, front squats, and bench presses. We focused on factors like ease of use, grip, storage, durability, overall value, and accuracy of the amounts listed on the weights. We noted results at one, three, and six months.</li><li><strong>Adjustable Dumbbells: </strong>With adjustable dumbbells, we paid attention to the ease of setup and unboxing as well as adjustability between exercises, which we timed and tested with both wet and dry hands while following a circuit. Then we tested ease of use by running the same circuit, paying attention to details like comfort. We then dropped the dumbbells from waist high onto both gym floors and concrete slabs to test for durability. Finally, we tested grip with both sweaty and dry hands and made notes of how compact they were.</li><li><strong>Kettlebells: </strong>We followed a similar regimen for kettlebells, assembling them according to any manufacturer’s instructions and also being sure to measure them for accuracy in weight. We also measured them with a tape measure to see how much space they took up. We then ran them through a circuit of kettlebell swings, single-leg deadlifts, goblet squats, and kettlebell snatches, timing the adjustable options to see how long they took to adjust between sets. We also tested durability by dropping them from waist height onto concrete and gym flooring while wearing safety goggles, and noted how they handled the damage. </li><li><strong>Treadmills</strong>: To test the best treadmills, we started with a five-minute warmup on a zero incline at low speed, paying attention to stability, security, pace accuracy, and whether the treadmill felt balanced. Next, we increased the speed to a slight jog for one minute. Then we stepped off and timed how long it took the treadmill to go from two miles per hour to its maximum speed, then back down to four miles per hour. For treadmills with incline, we tested gradual levels and eventually the highest incline. We also tested decline for two minutes before setting the machine back to a zero incline and doing a five-minute cool down. </li><li><strong>Weight Benches: </strong>As we unboxed and assembled each weight bench, we rated its ease of setup. During use, we paid special attention to stability, adjustability, portability, and whether we felt safe while doing a variety of exercises. In the longer term, we made note of whether there were any dings or scratches after use and whether the pad experienced any sort of peeling. At the six-month mark, we re-evaluated the comfort of the padding and whether or not it got squished over time, as well as how easy the bench was to keep clean. </li><li><strong>Resistance Bands: </strong>We start testing the best resistance bands by noting any odor upon opening the box and any accessories that came with the bands. We noted if they felt well made or cheap and flimsy, as well as if they had any scuffs or damage. We worked with an on-site personal trainer to ensure that we used the bands correctly, paying attention to the quality of the bands and how they affected the movements. After completing a circuit and taking a pause, we sprayed our hands with water to mimic the feeling of sweat, then ran through the circuit again to check the grip quality. Then we packed the bands up and brought them home for at-home testing, using the bands at least three times each week and noting our observations.</li><li><strong>Indoor Cycling Bikes: </strong>We timed how long it took to unbox and assemble each bike, noting whether the instructions were clear and how many people were needed for setup. For indoor cycling bikes that came assembled, we made note of the ease of setting up an appointment, if the setup team showed up on time, and how quickly they were able to get it into the home. Then we connected to Wi-Fi and set up an account on the bike’s streaming service, connecting the bike to any health apps. We sat on each bike and noted whether the seats tipped up or down and if the seat was cushioned enough for longer rides. We also checked if there was a bottle holder, clip-on pedals or caged pedals, and other design features. We did at least eight different workouts on the bikes, or at least two per week for four weeks. We took note of how smoothly the bikes rode, the number of resistance levels, ability to track factors like heart rate and speed, clarity and helpfulness of the display, and overall stability. We also paid attention to the variety of workouts offered and how easy it was to adjust the seats, handlebars, and resistance during a workout. </li><li><strong>Plyo Boxes</strong>: We paid attention to ease of setup, if the box was usable right away, and whether there was any learning curve. During workouts, we noted how stable each box felt, how well it grew with us as we advanced, sturdiness of the box, and whether we could adjust our speed and still feel secure. At the six-month mark, we examined the quality, noting whether the surface material began to fray, the box became squishier, or there were any other effects on overall quality and stability. </li><li><strong>Punching Bags</strong>: We paid attention to the materials, mounting style, and special features such as a Bluetooth app. We then tested the punching bags for twenty minutes, starting with five minutes of easy activity and using both our upper and lower body to get a feel for the bag. Then we did five minutes at a brisk tempo, using a faster pace and increased intensity. We ended with ten minutes of higher intensity to determine the appropriateness of the bag for longer activity. We also paid attention to other features like the type of bag and whether it was a freestanding or hanging punching bag. We also noted the height, weight, and stability of each bag. </li><li><strong>Yoga Mats: </strong>To test the best yoga mats, we made note of how flat each mat laid out and if we noticed any odors. We then rated padding, thickness, grip, and portability. We tested each mat with wet and dry hands and noted whether or not they come with mat straps or carrying bags. </li><li><strong>Ab Machines: </strong>We tested a variety of ab machines, including exercise balls, ab rollers, and rowing machines. To test the decline bench that made our list, we performed Russian Twists using 6-pound medicine balls for added resistance. Next, we tested the decline bench by doing decline sit ups, adjusting to the decline we were most comfortable with. Lastly, we repeated our testing with wet ankles to simulate sweat.  </li><li><strong>Fitness Mirrors: </strong>We started by unboxing each fitness mirror or having them assembled if white glove service was included. Then we created an account with the proprietary service, noting the cost and whether the service connects to Apple Health or any other health apps. We also checked whether we were able to stream our own music, choose which muscle group we wanted to target, or add user profiles. After completing the first workout, we noted how we felt during the session, how clear the instructions were, whether or not we could track metrics, and how we felt afterward. We used each mirror for a minimum of three times per week for a variety of workouts.</li><li><strong>Foam Rollers</strong>: We used each foam roller for at least 30 seconds on our calves, quadriceps, hips, hamstrings, and glutes, noting how we felt afterward. We repeated this routine every day for seven consecutive days, using the roller after our workouts. At the end of the week, we noted if our muscles feel more loose, knots were more relaxed or gone, and if we felt more agile. </li></ul><h2>The Experts</h2><ul><li>Jacob Sharf, In-home and Corporate Personal Trainer</li><li>Hesh Elberger, Fitness trainer at Iron Culture Gym in North Bergen, New Jersey</li></ul><h2>Your Questions, Answered</h2><h3>Is investing in a home gym worth it? </h3><p>Elberger says investing in a home gym is absolutely worth it, noting that you can get a great workout with a minimal amount of equipment. Sharf agrees that a home gym is worth the time and money, especially if you don’t plan on getting a gym membership. </p><h3>How much does it cost to put together a home gym? </h3><h3>What home exercise equipment is most effective?   </h3><p>According to Elberger, a barbell, bench press, and squat rack will allow you to do a wide variety of exercises. Multifunctional options like a barbell are also effective because they allow you to do different exercises like overhead presses and curls. Dumbbells can also provide a lot of variety, especially adjustable ones that allow you to progressively overload and build strength over time.</p><p>Elberger tells us that if you can bench, deadlift, and squat, you can build a solid training program. He also notes that bands can be good for stretching as well as resistance exercise. In Sharf’s opinion, resistance bands are the way to go, especially if you’re a beginner. They’re affordable, portable, and allow you to progress quickly. If you’re more experienced, Sharf likes adjustable dumbbells for building muscle and strength. </p><h2>Who We Are</h2><p>Jack Byram is a freelance writer who covers all things health and home related.
