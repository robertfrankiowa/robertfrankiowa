    <main><h1>Certain Dietary Habits May Be Behind Colon Cancer Rise in Young People, Experts Theorize</h1><p>               </p><p>Colon cancer rates are on the rise, particularly among young adults. Routine screening is recommended for adults age 45 years or older, who should be tested every ten years. However, a new study set out to examine the prevalence of this cancer for people aged 10 to 44. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers discovered that cases of colorectal cancers were increasing for all of the age groups. The next question they are trying to answer is why. And how can we prevent it?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The diet linked to increased colon cancer risk</strong></h2><p>This study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting. Researchers from Ohio State University say people eat too much sugar and not enough fiber, leading to the production of bacteria called <em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em> in the gut. This bacteria can make the colon more vulnerable to damage and mutations-and less likely to fight off cancer cells. <em>F. nucleatum </em>is usually found in the mouth; however, scientists have found increased amounts of it in people's intestines with colon tumors. The researchers found that since <em>F. nucleatum </em>can speed the aging of cells, young people with colon cancer were biologically older (as in their cells and organs) than their actual age. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biological age vs chronological age</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1pO22F_young_man_looking_at_an_older_himself_in_the_mirror.jpg" alt="young man looking at an older himself in the mirror"><figcaption><em>Source: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>"Microbes are manipulatable-you can target them. So [as] we see that this microbe is getting to tumors and may be contributing actively to disease progression, we can harness that information and think about how to prevent that," said Susan Bullman, Ph.D., of Fred Hutch Cancer Center, who co-led the study. The study's authors hope this finding could lead to potential new treatments that can inhibit this microbe. It may also lead to improvements in colon cancer screening. </p><p>Genetics, environment, and lifestyle can impact people's biological age. This includes things like diet and exercise regimes. Therefore, the study found that a diet high in fiber can lower the risk of certain types of cancer, including rectal, gastric, esophageal, and of course, colon. This is because dietary fiber nourishes healthy gut bacteria that can help prevent damage, and promote healing in the gut.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Energy drinks?</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1pNXZ9_asleep_student_trying_to_study_with_a_laptop_holding_energy_drink_in_the_night_at_home.jpg" alt="Asleep student trying to study with a laptop holding energy drink in the night at home"><figcaption><em>Source: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another theory suggests energy drinks may be a contributing factor to the rise of colorectal cancer. In particular, an ingredient called taurine can encourage the growth of damaging gut bacteria. The University of Florida's trial is currently underway and enrolling new participants, so time will tell if this theory is correct.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More colon cancer risk factors </strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1pObqK_woman_eating_beef_berger.jpg" alt="Woman eating beef berger"><figcaption><em>Source: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to the rise of early-onset colon cancer rates. But there are theories, such as the ones previously mentioned, that point to pre-existing health conditions and lifestyle habits. These include:</p><h2>7 Reasons Why This Is The Healthiest Alcoholic Drink…Ever</h2><ul>   <li>Family history of colorectal cancer.</li>   <li>Obesity</li>   <li>Inflammatory bowel diseases</li>   <li>Sedentary habits </li>   <li>Lack of physical activity</li>   <li>Smoking</li>   <li>A diet of too much red meat and processed foods high in fat</li>   <li>Not eating enough fruits, vegetables, and high-fiber foods</li>   <li>Moderate to heavy alcohol consumption</li>   <li>Genetic syndromes like Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)</li>  </ul><p>However, young people can check none of these boxes and still be at risk. <em>"We see plenty of younger people with colorectal cancer who are healthy and fit</em>," said colorectal surgeon David Liska, MD. <em>"So, it's not just obesity or having a sedentary lifestyle. It's a combination of factors."</em></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Symptoms of colon cancer</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Hearty Soul" src="IMG/BB1pO22W_young_woman_suffering_from_cystitis_on_bed_at_home.jpg" alt="Young woman suffering from cystitis on bed at home"><figcaption><em>Source: Shutterstock. Provided by The Hearty Soul</em></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, many young people and their doctors attribute the signs to less serious health conditions, assuming they are too young for colorectal cancer. Therefore, they only get properly diagnosed when their cancer worsens. Early signs of colon cancer include:</p><ul>   <li>Blood in the stool</li>   <li>Intense belly pain that doesn't go away</li>   <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>   <li>Persistent constipation and/or diarrhea</li>   <li>Not feeling "done" after a bowel movement and other shifts in bathroom habits</li>  </ul><p>"<em>Don't assume that a change means nothing,"</em> advises Dr. Liska. "<em>Talk to your doctor so they can do an assessment. Colorectal cancer can be extremely treatable and curable, but early diagnosis is key."</em></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention tips</strong></h2><p>Young people don't need to be overly concerned, according to Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John's Cancer Institute. He comments on the aforementioned study, saying, "They use percentages, which are very high, to suggest that there is a 400% or 500% increase in very young people being diagnosed with colon cancer. But if you translate that to absolute numbers, we're talking about the difference between 1 or 2 out of a million versus 6 out of a million.</p><p>"<em>So I think when we talk about these absolute numbers versus the percentages, the percentages sound very alarming, but the actual numbers suggest that it still is not very common among really young people,"</em> Bilchik concluded.</p><p>With that in mind, there are ways to lower one's risk of colorectal cancer. Namely, knowing if a close family member ever had it, getting screened when appropriate, speaking to a doctor about any related health concerns, and leading a healthy lifestyle. </p><ol>   <li class="has-small-font-size"><em>"Microbiome signature, immune landscape and global methylation in early onset colorectal cancer."</em> ASCO.
