An impairment refers to a significant difference in your body structure or ability to function. Impairments may also be related to cognitive (brain-related) and emotional functioning. Disabilities vary widely and can affect your physical, mental, or emotional health. </p><p>Disabilities can affect several aspects of your functioning, including movement, vision, hearing, thinking, learning, and communication. A disability may be present at birth or develop later in life. About 1 in 4 people in the United States have a disability, and 7.2% of adults have difficulty living independently because of their disability.</p><p>Fortunately, there are many resources available for both children and adults to manage their disabilities and live well with their condition.  </p><h2>Types of Disabilities</h2><p>There are several different types of disabilities, which are usually grouped by how they affect your functioning. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Movement:</strong> A movement disability includes any impairment that makes moving your body more challenging. About 12.1% of adults in the U.S. have a disability that affects their ability to walk or climb stairs.</li><li><strong>Cognition:</strong> Cognition disabilities affect memory, learning, and understanding. About 12.8% of adults in the U.S. have a cognition disability that causes difficulty concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions. </li><li><strong>Vision:</strong> Vision disabilities include blindness or difficulty seeing when wearing glasses. These disabilities affect 4.8% of adults in the U.S. </li><li><strong>Hearing:</strong> People with a hearing disability are deaf or hard of hearing. This affects about 6.1% of adults in the U.S. </li><li><strong>Mental health:</strong> People with chronic mental health conditions like depression or schizophrenia may have difficulty functioning throughout the day.</li></ul><p>A disability can be short-term or long-term (chronic). Symptoms may come and go or get worse over time:</p><ul><li><strong>Chronic health conditions:</strong> Chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease are the leading causes of disability among adults in the U.S.</li><li><strong>Progressive conditions:</strong> Progressive disorders like muscular dystrophy cause physical disabilities that can get worse over time. </li><li><strong>Intermittent conditions:</strong> Symptoms of intermittent conditions can come and go depending on your overall health. An example of an intermittent condition is multiple sclerosis (MS). </li></ul><p>Disabilities can have different risk factors. They can develop in childhood or later in life. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Pregnancy exposure:</strong> Being exposed to alcohol, cigarettes, or certain infections like rubella while in utero (in the womb) raises the risk of disability. </li><li><strong>Developmental conditions:</strong> Disabilities that are often diagnosed in childhood include autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These impairments affect a child's ability to learn, process information, and communicate. </li><li><strong>Injuries:</strong> A traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury can cause long-term impairments that affect movement, cognition, and mental health.  </li></ul><h2>What Causes Disability?</h2><p>Disabilities often occur for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Genetic mutations (changes)</li><li>Having an extra or missing chromosome</li><li>Exposure to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and certain infections while in the womb</li><li>Childbirth complications, such as being born prematurely or not receiving enough oxygen during birth</li><li>Injury to the brain or spinal cord</li><li>Underlying health conditions that can sometimes occur later in life</li></ul><h2>How Does a Disability Affect Your Life?</h2><p>Living with a disability can often cause some challenges in the physical, social, economic, and emotional aspects of your daily life. Consider the following examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Higher risk of health conditions: </strong>People with disabilities may be more likely to develop conditions like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.</li><li><strong>Barriers to care: </strong>People with disabilities also often face barriers to adequate healthcare. In fact, 25% of adults with a disability in the U.S. have unmet health needs or do not have a regular healthcare provider. More resources for people with disabilities and healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about disability are needed. </li><li><strong>Emotional effects: </strong>If you have a disability, you may notice changes in your mood and self-esteem. Low self-esteem can raise the risk of anxiety, depression, substance use, and antisocial behavior. One 2022 study found that people who can accept their disability and live well with their condition usually have higher self-esteem than those who do not. </li><li><strong>Financial wellness: </strong>People with disabilities tend to have a harder time obtaining employment and earning enough money. Research shows that people with a strong support system from family are less likely to experience poverty than those who are solely responsible for their finances. </li></ul><h2>Health Complications of Having a Disability</h2><p>There are many potential health complications you might be at risk of if you live with a disability. Having a disability may increase your risk of the following health conditions and symptoms:</p><ul><li>Fatigue</li><li>Chronic pain</li><li>Obesity</li><li>Depression</li><li>Heart disease</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Bowel or bladder problems</li></ul><p>People with disabilities are 4-10 times more likely to experience violence, abuse, or neglect than those without disabilities. For resources on how to get help if you or a loved one with a disability are experiencing abuse, please visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline resource page here.</p><h2>Diagnosis and Evaluation</h2><p>There are several tests available to evaluate and diagnose a disability. Many disabilities may be present at birth or when you're still a child. However, if you develop a disability later in life, a healthcare provider can offer support.</p><p>When you see your healthcare provider, they will likely start with a thorough medical history and physical exam. They will ask several questions about your symptoms and how they affect your daily life. </p><p>Your provider may recommend further evaluation with a physical or occupational therapist and a psychologist or psychiatrist. Your healthcare team usually uses a variety of physical and cognitive tests to understand your disability and the symptoms you're experiencing. Common tools that your healthcare team may use to diagnose a disability include:</p><ul><li><strong>Functional tests:</strong> Your provider will ask you to complete a task or set of tasks to assess your ability to function. Examples include a grip strength test, walking test, jumping test, balance test, and other strength tests. </li><li><strong>Neurocognitive tests:</strong> Your provider will test your vision, hearing, and cognitive function with a variety of screenings. </li><li><strong>Questionnaires: </strong>Your provider will ask you to answer several questions about your symptoms, functioning, mental health, and daily life. </li></ul><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the three dimensions of having a disability include:</p><ul><li>Impairment in a person’s physical or mental functioning</li><li>Activity limitation due to the impairment</li><li>Restrictions in normal daily activities </li></ul><p>When you have a documented disability, you may be eligible for disability benefits through the Social Security Administration (SSA). According to the SSA, people may be eligible for benefits if they have a “medically determinable physical or mental impairment” for at least 12 months. </p><p>The 5-step process for applying for SSA benefits includes answering five questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Are you working?:</strong> To understand if you are currently able to work </li><li><strong>Is your condition severe?:</strong> To learn if your condition significantly limits your ability to do basic work-related tasks</li><li><strong>Is your condition included in the SSA list of disabling conditions?:</strong> To ensure that your condition is on the list of approved disabilities that the SSA covers</li><li><strong>Can you do the work you did previously?: </strong>To determine if your condition is preventing you from performing the work you have done in the past</li><li><strong>Can you do other types of work?:</strong> To see whether you can transfer any of your skills to other types of work you are able to perform with your disability</li></ol><h2>Rights and Legislation for People with Disabilities</h2><p>All people with disabilities deserve rights and protections under the law in the U.S. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodations, communications, and access to government facilities. This law is meant to prevent a disability from interfering with your ability to work, travel, and function in your everyday life. </p><p>Government agencies involved in supporting and enforcing the ADA include:</p><ul><li>Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</li><li>U.S. Department of Labor</li><li>U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</li><li>U.S. Department of Transportation</li><li>U.S. Department of Justice</li><li>U.S. Department of Education </li><li>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services </li></ul><h2>Resources for People with Disabilities</h2><p>There are several resources available for people with disabilities and their loved ones. Government agencies that provide support for disabilities include:</p><ul><li>Administration for Community Living</li><li>Office for Civil Rights</li><li>Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion</li><li>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</li></ul><p>Resources for employment for people with disabilities include:</p><ul><li>Americans with Disabilities Act</li><li>Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion</li></ul><p>Organizations that provide general resources to people with disabilities include:</p><ul><li>American Council of the Blind</li><li>Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</li><li>Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance</li><li>Hearing Loss Association of America</li><li>Learning Disabilities Association of America</li></ul><p>If you have a disability, talking to your healthcare provider can also help you learn more about the resources that specifically support your condition.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>A disability is any physical, mental, or emotional condition that makes certain activities more challenging. Birth defects, injuries, and certain health conditions can all cause a disability—no matter your age.</p><p>Disabilities can affect several aspects of your life such as your physical well-being, senses (e.g., vision and hearing), emotional health, and ability to carry out daily activities. However, a healthy and enjoyable life is still possible with a disability.</p><p>More research and resources about disabilities, competent healthcare providers, and community support are still necessary to improve the livelihood of people with disabilities. Fortunately, resources like the Americans with Disabilities Act can help you understand your disability, educate you about your rights, and guide you to more tips, assistive devices, and resources to live well.</p></main>
