    <main><h1>12 Ways to Lose 60 Pounds, Shared by Lauryn Bosstick</h1><p>Lauryn Bosstick is opening up about her weight loss. In a new social media post, The Skinny Confidential podcaster and author reveals exactly how she transformed her body after having a baby. "How I lost 60 pounds, post-pregnancy," she writes in the Instagram post, sharing a before-and-after photo highlighting her amazing transformation. Here is everything she did to get into shape.</p><h2>1 She Started Lifting Weights</h2><p>Lauryn reveals that she started weight-lifting. "I lift heavy weights like 4x, sometimes 5x, a week. weight-lifting completely shrinks body composition, which has been wild to watch," she wrote.</p><figure><img title="1 She Started Lifting Weights" src="IMG/BB1ordEE_1_she_started_lifting_weights.jpg" alt="1 She Started Lifting Weights"><figcaption><em>1 She Started Lifting Weights. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Building Muscle Is "Key" As We Age</h2><p>According to Lauryn, she has "been doing this consistently for 2 years." She also added that "it's not overnight, but my God, it works. Building muscle is key as we age," she said. "I am very much passionate about talking about weight-lifting for women- I feel like it needs better PR?"</p><h2>3 Why Strength Training Is a Great Workout</h2><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, strength and weight training help reduce body fat, preserve and increase lean muscle mass, and burn calories more efficiently. Strength training may also help you:</p><p>— Develop strong bones</p><p>— Manage your weight</p><p>— Enhance your quality of life</p><p>— Manage chronic conditions</p><p>— Sharpen your thinking skills</p><h2>4 Coffee Plus Raw Milk</h2><p>Lauryn starts her day with "a cup of coffee with an inch and a half of raw milk," she says. "It's filled with vitamins and minerals, plus the perfect amount of protein."</p><h2>5 Eggs for Breakfast</h2><p>Lauryn continues packing in the protein at breakfast. "My first meal is typically three farmers market eggs," she says. "I don't have a specific diet, though- I eat what I like."</p><h2>6 Lots of Meat</h2><p>She continues eating lots of protein at lunch and dinner, revealing that "every single day for the last two years" she eats "a huge bowl of meat" – organs and all. "I like the 'ancestral blend' so I get all the organs (liver !) too. the amino acids in meat have also grown my hair to the point where I don't need to wear extensions anymore. after eating like this, my body craves meat every single day."</p><h2>7 Hydration</h2><p>Lauryn also prioritizes hydration. Another one of her "random daily habits" is drinking electrolytes with lemon water "every morning before coffee."</p><h2>8 Walking</h2><p>She also gets her steps in. "I walk every single day outside in the morning. Before bed, I try to walk too, so I essentially bookend the day with walking," she says.</p><figure><img title="8 Walking" src="IMG/BB1ordER_8_walking.jpg" alt="8 Walking"><figcaption><em>8 Walking. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Sleep</h2><p>Lauryn claims that rest is also essential. "I prioritize sleep," she says. "We are a family that sleeps- like in bed at 9 pm latest. speaking of priorities." What are the health benefits of sleep? According to the Sleep Foundation, getting enough z's is a mood booster, promotes heart health, regulates blood sugar, improves mental function, restores your immune system, helps relieve stress, and aids in weight loss.</p><h2>10 Meditation</h2><p>And she makes sure to get her zen on. "I prioritize my peace- meditation," she says. She also does breathwork. "When you meditate, you may clear away the information overload that builds up every day and contributes to your stress," says the Mayo Clinic. Benefits include:</p><p>— Gaining a new perspective on stressful situations</p><p>— Building skills to manage your stress</p><p>— Increasing self-awareness</p><p>— Focusing on the present</p><p>— Reducing negative emotions</p><p>— Increasing imagination and creativity</p><p>— Increasing patience and tolerance</p><p>— Lowering resting heart rate</p><p>— Lowering resting blood pressure</p><p>— Improving sleep quality</p><figure><img title="10 Meditation" src="IMG/BB1oqZCe_10_meditation.jpg" alt="10 Meditation"><figcaption><em>10 Meditation. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>11 Pilates</h2><p>Another fitness method Lauryn attributes to helping her slim down? Classical Pilates, she reveals. Why is pilates a good workout? According to the Mayo Clinic there are lots of benefits to the workout, as it "strengthens the body's inner core while increasing its flexibility resulting in improved overall health." It can also promote longer, leaner muscles, injury prevention, relief from stress and back pain, enhanced athletic performance, and heightened mind-body awareness.</p><h2>12 Cold Plunges</h2><p>Lauryn is one of the many people who swear by cold plunges. There is limited research supporting the benefits of cold plunges, which may include easing sore muscles, bringing body temperature down, increased focus, improved sleep, and decreased inflammation, per the Cleveland Clinic. However, a 2021 study found that cold water immersion therapy promotes basic post-sport recovery.</p><h2>13 Saunas</h2><p>However, she does enjoy saunas too. Potential benefits include detoxification, increased metabolism, weight loss, increased blood circulation, pain reduction, antiaging, skin rejuvenation, improved cardiovascular function, improved immune function, improved sleep, stress management, and relaxation. However, there isn't a lot of research backing up the claims.</p><figure><img title="13 Saunas" src="IMG/BB1nrrIL_13_saunas.jpg" alt="13 Saunas"><figcaption><em>13 Saunas. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>14 Limited Alcohol</h2><p>Lauryn cut down on her drinking. "I reserve alcohol now for special occasions and vacations," she explained.</p><h2>15 Keep It Simple, She Says</h2><p>"I wanted to share my weight loss story because if I had seen a post like this three years ago…it would've changed my world," she says at the end of the post. "It becomes overwhelming when it's too complicated. simple: weights, protein, daily habits."
