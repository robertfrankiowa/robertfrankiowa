Chris McMahon, a nutrition and fitness coach, agrees. However, if plain water is too boring, he suggests driving flavored water instead.</p><h2>3 Use a Calorie Calculator</h2><p>Now, it's time to figure out how much you should be eating. "I would then use a calculator to figure out how many calories you should be consuming to lose weight. And if you want an easy calculator, you can use the one in my bio," Alex says. You canbenchmark your progress with this useful Lean Body Mass Calculator.</p><figure><img title="3 Use a Calorie Calculator" src="IMG/BB1ntMkz_3_use_a_calorie_calculator.jpg" alt="3 Use a Calorie Calculator"><figcaption><em>3 Use a Calorie Calculator. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Amp Up Protein Intake</h2><p>Next up, it's time to amp up your protein intake. "I would also aim to eat one gram of protein per pound of gold body weight," he says. According to clinical trials, consuming more protein than the recommended dietary allowance not only reduces body weight (BW) but also enhances body composition by decreasing fat mass while preserving fat-free mass (FFM) in both low-calorie and standard-calorie diets.</p><h2>5 Eat High Volume, Low Calorie Food</h2><p>"After figuring out my calorie and my protein goals, I would try to eat as much high volume low calorie as possible to meet those calories and that protein goal," he explains. He recommends "tons of lean protein, fruits, and vegetables" and trying to "stay as full as possible."</p><h2>6 Walk 8,000 to 10,000 Steps Per Day</h2><p>"I would also try to walk and do 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day, seven days a week," he says. "It doesn't matter how fast you do it or if you reach that step goal in one or ten sessions throughout the day, it doesn't matter. Just reach that number."</p><figure><img title="6 Walk 8,000 to 10,000 Steps Per Day" src="IMG/BB1ntXS7_6_walk_8000_to_10000_steps_per_day.jpg" alt="6 Walk 8,000 to 10,000 Steps Per Day"><figcaption><em>6 Walk 8,000 to 10,000 Steps Per Day. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 From Weight Loss to Brain Health: The Far-Reaching Benefits of Walking</h2><p>A 2018 study published in the journal <em>Obesity</em> found a link between walking 10,000 steps a day and weight loss and weight management. Other studies published by the <em>Journal of American Medical Association</em> (<em>JAMA</em>) in <em>JAMA Neurology</em> and in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em> also linked walking 10,000 steps a day to less dementia and less cardiovascular disease overall, with less heart disease, less heart failure and fewer strokes.</p><figure><img title="7 From Weight Loss to Brain Health: The Far-Reaching Benefits of Walking" src="IMG/AA1o21Pj_7_from_weight_loss_to_brain_health_the_far_reaching_benefits_of_walking.jpg" alt="7 From Weight Loss to Brain Health: The Far-Reaching Benefits of Walking"><figcaption><em>7 From Weight Loss to Brain Health: The Far-Reaching Benefits of Walking. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Try Not To Cheat</h2><p>According to Alex, "By far, the most important thing is to follow your calorie goal as closely as possible seven days a week, weekends included," he says. "Let me say it again for the people in the back, weekends included because the calorie deficit doesn't matter if you only follow it when you feel like it." Some experts suggest a weekly calorie goal instead of a daily one, which allows a little leniency if you happen to splurge one day.
