    <main><h1>10 Ways To Unclog Your Pores For Good, According To Dermatologists</h1><p><p>Pores: we all have them, and we've all been frustrated with clogging at some point. We even may have tried to reduce their appearance at one point with a pore vacuum or a pore minimizing product. “A clogged pore is caused by increased sebum (the oils produced by skin), dead skin cells, and dirt—stuff from the outside world, even makeup,” says dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, Associate Clinical Professor at Yale University. </p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts</strong>: Mona Gohara, MD, is a dermatologist and associate clinical professor at Yale University. Joshua Zeichner, MD, is a dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Shari Marchbein, MD, is a dermatologist and fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology. Whitney Tolpinrud, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and head dermatologist and medical director at Agency.</p><p> And, if you think you have large pores, it could just be that they're clogged and drawing more attention to themselves. “The size of your pores don't change," says dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Think of a plastic grocery bag—when it's empty, it's tight and stuck together; when you fill it up, it expands. The same thing happens when your pores are full. </p><p>So, if you want to make your pores appear smaller, keep them clean. Here, the safest and most effective ways to do so. </p><h2 class="body-h2"> 1. Use salicylic acid. </h2><p>To get the gunk out of your pores, you need the best gunk buster around—salicylic acid. "Gentile exfoliating cleansers of the salicylic acid variant are great because salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that cuts through sebum and breaks it down," says Dr. Gohara. If using a cleanser, leave it on a little longer than you normally would before rinsing to give it some extra time to work its magic.</p><h2 class="body-h2">2. Mask with charcoal or clay once a week. </h2><p class="body-text"> It's no surprise that these OG acne-fighting heroes are great ingredients for unclogging pores. "Some of my favorite ways to unclog pores are by using either clay or charcoal masks which can help draw impurities, bacteria and sebum/oil out of pores," says Shari Marchbein, MD, dermatologist and fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology. But, she cautions that masking is only a temporary fix, and should be repeated at least once a week to truly benefit your skin and reduce the appearance of pores. </p><figure><img title="lovekinship.com" src="IMG/AA1hzrp6_kinship_mint_mud.jpg" alt="Kinship Mint Mud"><figcaption><em>Kinship Mint Mud. lovekinship.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="body-h2">3. Invest in a comedone extractor.</h2><p>As satisfying as it is to squeeze a blackhead, it is the hands-down worst way to to treat a clogged pore. But, using a comedone extractor is not only safe and effective, it's also dermatologist recommended. "Comedone extractors are regularly used in extraction treatments at a dermatologists office, so they are good and safe tools to use when dealing with clogged pores," says Dr. Gohara. Just be sure to thoroughly clean it with rubbing alcohol after each use. </p><figure><img title="amazon.com" src="IMG/AA1hzhv4_tweezerman_no_slip_skin_care_tool.jpg" alt="Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool"><figcaption><em>Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="body-h2">4. Use retinol in your routine. </h2><p>For people who are prone to breakouts, or even for those who aren't but face pore insecurity (shout out to my big pore people!) Dr. Marchbein suggests using prescription retinoids like Retin A or over-the-counter options like Differin gel. "Retinoid creams can build collagen over time, thereby strengthening the walls of pores and making them appear smaller. They also act to exfoliate the skin," she says.</p><figure><img title="target.com" src="IMG/AA1hzrpb_differin1_acne_gel.jpg" alt="Differin.1% Acne Gel"><figcaption><em>Differin.1% Acne Gel . target.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="body-h2">5. Indulge in a weekly pore strip.</h2><p>It turns out those super satisfying pore strips are actually derm approved! Dr. Marchbein says, "adhesive pore strips can temporarily improve clogged pores by removing trapped dirt and oil by using an adhesive. However, these treatments need to be repeated at least once a week as pores will naturally fill back up." Keep in mind: It may be satisfying, but Dr. Marchbein says there's no permanent change or improvements on the skin from using the strips.</p><figure><img title="dermstore.com" src="IMG/AA1hzmyJ_hydropeptide_bambusa_blackhead_banisher_pore_perfecting_nose_mask_8_piece.jpg" alt="HydroPeptide Bambusa Blackhead Banisher Pore Perfecting Nose Mask (8 piece)"><figcaption><em>HydroPeptide Bambusa Blackhead Banisher Pore Perfecting Nose Mask (8 piece). dermstore.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="body-h2">6. Opt for in-office acne facials. </h2><p class="body-text">Acne facials are an effective and great way to unclog pores, just ask any dermatologist. "In office treatments, such as Hydrafacials and microdermabrasion are good examples of less aggressive in-office treatments that can improve the appearance of pores by mechanically exfoliating the skin," says Dr. Marchbein. They also allow pore clearing ingredients like salicylic acid to go deeper into the skin, "which can further contribute to glowing skin, even pigmentation and the appearance of smaller pores," she adds. </p><h2 class="body-h2">7. Try microneedling. </h2><p>You may not have expected microneedling to make this list of ways to treat clogged pores, but it can actually work wonders. "The needles go into the skin to generate these little micro channels of injury, which can physically break up the pores," explains board-certified dermatologist Whitney Tolpinrud, MD.</p><p>In addition to clearing pores, the small holes formed by the needles will allow your skincare products to penetrate deeper. "It's a really nice way to help add an extra boost to your exfoliating journey," adds Dr. Tolpinrun. "You'll start to see improvements after about a month, but you're going to see more added benefit each time you do it." </p><h2 class="body-h2">8. Use a non-comedogenic cleanser regularly. </h2><p>Some people prefer to wash their face once a day, while others do it twice. Either way, cleansing is a must, if you want to give your skin the reset it needs. "Cleansers are designed to form little microscopic spheres around the dirt, oil, extra debris, and makeup that might be on the skin," says Dr. Tolpinrud. "So just keeping that up with a good gentle skincare routine can help prevent the clogging of pores."</p><p>Treatment options and facial tools can be helpful, but sticking to a consistent skincare regimen can go a long way, too. If you're unsure which cleanser to get, Dr. Tolpinrud suggests opting for formulas that don't contain ingredients (like coconut oil, for example) that will clog your pores. Additionally, it can be helpful to swap out skincare products depending on the time of year. Do you get more oily during the summer? If so, try gel-based products since they contain more water than oil.</p><p><h2 class="body-h2">9. Exfoliate with an AHA.</h2><p>To start shedding dead skin cells and breaking up pores, try alpha hydroxy acids. Some of the most common ones include glycolic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid. If you have sensitive skin, Dr. Tolpinrun suggests lactic acid because of how gentle it is. Otherwise, glycolic acid can be used to deeply penetrate the skin. Just keep in mind that it tends to be more irritating, so starting off slow is your best bet. </p><h2 class="body-h2">10. Consider using azelaic acid or sulfur. </h2><p>Azelaic acid, which is neither an AHA nor a BHA, is a grain-derived ingredient that can treat acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation while unclogging pores and exfoliating the skin, says Dr. Tolpinrud.</p><p>Sulfur (like azelaic acid) is comedolytic, meaning it also exfoliates. "It's an ingredient that can be used [to treat] rosacea, acne, excess oil, and bacteria on the skin," says Dr. Tolpinrud. "It's not really at the forefront of consumer's minds when they're thinking about ingredients, but sulfur is great."</p></main>
