    <main><h1>Taking Magnesium May Help With Weight Loss, But Only Indirectly</h1><p>There’s a lot to navigate when you make the decision to go on a weight loss journey, including what you plan to eat, how to exercise, and what lifestyle changes you might need to make moving forward. With that, it makes sense to want to do everything you can to make sure that you’re setting yourself up for success. </p><p>One piece of advice you may have come across in your research is using magnesium for weight loss. The mineral is linked to a bunch of different processes in your body, including the development of your bones, muscle function, and regulating the rhythm of your heart, per the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Some doctors claim you can take magnesium for sleep, digestion, and that it may even help with anxiety. But what about weight loss?</p><figure><img title="d3sign - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1hYBA6_can_magnesium_help_you_lose_weight.jpg" alt="Can Magnesium Help You Lose Weight?"><figcaption><em>Magnesium supplements can help you lose weight if you have a deficiency, according to experts.

Weight loss is complicated—even in the most ideal conditions—and using magnesium on your weight loss journey isn’t a one-size-fits-all process. Meaning, this supplement very well may be helpful for you—or it could be a waste of your money.</p><p>So, how can magnesium help with weight loss, and is it something worth trying? Here’s what you need to know. </p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts</strong>: Kunal Shah, MD, is an assistant professor in the division of endocrinology at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center. Amber Core, RD, is a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Keri Gans, RD, is the author of <em>The Small Change Diet.</em></p><h2 class="body-h2">What is magnesium, exactly?</h2><p>Magnesium is an essential micronutrient and abundant mineral in your body, according to the NIH. It has a variety of health benefits and is linked to various important processes in the body, like building good bone structure, regulating your heart rhythm, energy production, muscle and nerve function, and more. </p><p>While you can easily take a magnesium supplement (usually in pill, powder, or gummy form), most of us can get enough of the nutrient through our diet. “Magnesium can easily be obtained from foods we eat, such as nuts and seeds, legumes, whole grains, bananas, dark green leafy vegetables, and soy,” says Keri Gans, RD, author of <em>The Small Change Diet. </em> </p><h2 class="body-h2">Can magnesium help with weight loss? </h2><p>Yes, magnesium can potentially help with weight loss—but it’s complicated, says Kunal Shah, MD, an assistant professor in the division of endocrinology at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center. </p><p>“Magnesium helps with weight loss if you have a deficiency,” Dr. Shah says. That’s mostly because too little magnesium is also linked with insulin resistance, which is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin—a hormone that controls your blood sugar—and can't easily take up glucose from your blood, he explains. </p><p>“There is also some thought that a magnesium deficiency can lead to a more pro-inflammatory state,” Dr. Shah says. “That pro-inflammatory state and insulin resistance can cause weight gain—but that’s <em>if</em> you have a magnesium deficiency.”</p><p>Ultimately, magnesium’s impact on weight is likely to be more indirect than direct, says Amber Core, RD, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Magnesium is known to have calming effects,” she says. That can raise the odds you’ll have more restful sleep, which can reduce the level of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, in your body, Core says. </p><p>“When we don’t get enough sleep at night, the body looks for increased energy from foods, and increases ghrelin to tell us to eat,” Core says. “By eating less during the day, we may lose some weight over time.”</p><p>People who have obesity are also more likely to be deficient in magnesium, a 2021 study found. However, Core points out that there’s no strong evidence that taking magnesium will directly cause weight loss. But, if you do have a magnesium deficiency, “you could definitely argue that supplementing with magnesium could help,” Dr. Shah says. </p><h2 class="body-h2">How To Know If You Have A Magnesium Deficiency</h2><p>Half of Americans don’t have enough magnesium in their diets, 2019 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggests. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for magnesium is 310 to 320 milligrams for most adult women and 400 to 420 milligrams for most adult men, per the NIH. </p><p>That said, magnesium deficiency can be hard to detect. Early signs of deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness, per the NIH—and certain conditions like type 2 diabetes, chronic alcoholism, or taking certain medications may contribute. You may also see symptoms like muscle cramping or twitching, Gans says. </p><p>If you suspect you have a magnesium deficiency, talk to your doctor. They may want to do a blood test to see where your levels are, Dr. Shah says. From there, your doctor may recommend that you eat more magnesium-rich foods or take a supplement, although the supplement amount would depend on your level of deficiency.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Tried-And-True Weight Loss Strategies</h2><p>Although magnesium may be helpful in some cases, experts stress that the key to weight loss isn’t as simple as increasing the amount of magnesium in your diet or taking a magnesium supplement. </p><ol><li><strong>Eat a nutritious diet full of whole foods</strong>. “Diet is going to be the most important for weight loss,” Dr. Shah says. He recommends avoiding things that can cause insulin spikes—like processed foods and refined carbohydrates—and focusing on eating a good mix of protein, vegetables, fruits, and unprocessed carbohydrates like oats and brown rice.</li><li><strong>Use a meal-tracking app.</strong> Core suggests tracking your food intake, too. “We often eat 50 to 100 percent more calories per day than we realize,” she says. “Keeping track of our food intake is key to making sustainable success.”</li><li><strong>Up your protein intake. </strong>Core recommends adding one high-protein food with each meal, too, like chicken breast or Greek yogurt. “More protein will help to keep you feeling full and support building and maintaining muscle mass,” she says. </li><li><strong>Drink more water.</strong> “Staying hydrated is important to avoid over-eating,” Core says. “Our brains often confuse hunger and thirst, so try reaching for a bottle of water before opening the pantry door.”</li></ol><p>It's also important to do your best to get a good night’s sleep, lower your stress levels, and move daily, Gans says. </p><p>If you’re trying to lose weight and are concerned that you aren’t making progress, check in with a doctor or registered dietitian. They should be able to help make personalized recommendations to get you on a path to success.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Frequently Asked Questions About Magnesium For Weight Loss</h2><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>How much magnesium should I take?</strong></h3><p>It depends. Again, the RDA for magnesium is 310 to 320 milligrams for most adult women and 400 to 420 milligrams for most adult men. If your doctor determines that you’re not getting enough magnesium and you can’t get enough of the mineral through food sources, they should help you figure out dosing for a supplement. Keep this in mind from Core, though: You shouldn’t take more than 350 milligrams of magnesium with a supplement unless your doctor explicitly recommends it. </p><h3 class="body-h3">What are the risks of taking too much magnesium?</h3><p>Dr. Shah says it’s “difficult” to overdose on magnesium. However, taking too much can lead to gastrointestinal issues like nausea, diarrhea, and stomach cramps, he says. “If you take a really high dose, you can feel super tired and potentially have cardiac issues,” Dr. Shah says. </p><p>Magnesium citrate is the most common form of magnesium supplement, Core says—you can pick it up in most grocery stores. “This form is intended to be used to raise magnesium levels in the body and prevent deficiency for those who are not getting sufficient dietary magnesium through foods,” she says. Magnesium chloride can also be found as a supplement but is less common, Core says. </p><p>Ultimately, magnesium may be a tool to help with weight loss if you have a deficiency—but magnesium alone won’t cause you to lose weight. If you’re concerned about your magnesium levels or weight loss journey, talk to your healthcare provider for personalized guidance.</p></main>
