    <main><h1>What Gen Z Eat to Lose Weight and Slash Blood Sugar</h1><p>The ACV Diet, short for Apple Cider Vinegar Diet, has recently gained popularity among Gen Z. This naturally fermented product captures the nutrients from apples through a natural fermentation process without artificial methods. It takes about three months to produce properly. But does consuming ACV help with weight loss?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Spotlight on Apple Cider Vinegar Diet</h2><p>Amidst the attention on the apple cider vinegar diet, research shows that drinking a small amount of vinegar daily can aid in weight loss. Acetic acid, a nutrient formed during the natural fermentation of apples, inhibits fat synthesis and promotes fat burning. It reduces calorie intake by suppressing sugar absorption. Studies have shown that individuals consuming apple cider vinegar saw greater body mass index and weight decreases compared to those who did not.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Difference Between Apple Cider Vinegar and Regular Apple Vinegar</h2><p>Apple cider vinegar is a naturally fermented, organic apple vinegar without chemical additives. It is rich in nutrients due to its long fermentation period and is unheated, unfiltered, and unpasteurized. A distinguishing feature is the inclusion of mother of vinegar, a substance containing bioactive components. In contrast, regular apple vinegar lacks this mother and contains sugar, making it less recommended for diet and blood sugar management.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Excellent for Detox and Fatigue Relief</h2><p>Pectin, commonly found in fruits, helps eliminate waste accumulated in the intestines. Apple cider vinegar contains pectin, which improves intestinal health and effectively treats constipation. It is also rich in vitamin C and citric acid, where acetic acid helps improve blood circulation and metabolize lactic acid accumulated in muscles, aiding in quick fatigue recovery.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Effective in Preventing Diabetes</h2><p>Apple cider vinegar helps suppress blood sugar spikes, making it beneficial in diabetes prevention. Consuming two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar daily can reduce post-meal and fasting blood sugar levels. Research has also shown that men who consumed vinegar experienced significantly reduced visceral fat and waist circumference compared to those who did not.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">When is the Best Time to Consume?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1loAVv_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood202420240327600a7b04b35aeba0b8982f65dac2e0d5jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2024/20240327/600a7b04b35aeba0b8982f65dac2e0d5.jpg"><figcaption><em>.

However, drinking it before bed is not advisable as it may reflux into the esophagus while lying down. If consumed at night, staying seated for about 30 minutes before bed is better. It’s also recommended not to brush your teeth immediately after consuming apple cider vinegar to prevent enamel wear; wait at least 30 minutes before brushing.</p><h3>Editor's Pick</h3><ol> <li>Top 10 Foods You Can Eat Without Worrying About Calories</li> <li>Slim Down Fast: 10 Secrets to Losing Sudden Weight Gain</li> <li>Why Young Americans Can’t Kick the Spicy, Sweet, and Salty Habit</li> <li>Age and Weight Loss: Breaking Down the Science Behind the Struggle</li> </ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dilution is Necessary</h2><p>Consuming undiluted apple cider vinegar can damage the esophagus and stomach lining. It should be diluted with water or carbonated water or consumed with food. Diluting 15-30 ml of vinegar in a cup of water is sufficient. If you experience heartburn or discomfort, reduce the intake amount.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why ACV is Essential for Dieting</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1loP0Y_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood202420240327ca189fd600908c468524484c7b87efb2jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2024/20240327/ca189fd600908c468524484c7b87efb2.jpg"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Those on low-carb, high-fat diets often consume ACV. People undergoing low-carbohydrate diets or intermittent fasting consume ACV to prevent sudden spikes in blood sugar levels after breaking a long fast or consuming carbohydrates in large amounts. ACV helps prevent rapid increases in blood sugar and facilitates digestion, especially after meat consumption.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Various Ways to Use ACV</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1loFrS_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood202420240327633681697ab8f2b030d6f69a3512044fjpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2024/20240327/633681697ab8f2b030d6f69a3512044f.jpg"><figcaption><em>.

It can be added to vegetable salads with olive oil and salt. Beyond cooking, a few drops can be used to wash your face or as a substitute for hair rinse.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Points of Caution When Purchasing ACV</h2><p>For first-time consumers, choosing a product with an acidity level of 0.7-1% is advisable. Starting with a high acidity can irritate the stomach and intestines. Also, check whether it’s made from 100% real apples without additives. While liquid form is more effective, starting with powder or jelly forms can be a good option for beginners.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Possible Side Effects of Apple Cider Vinegar</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1loP1b_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentfood202420240327e6a2ff7afa79a534065edc82b3bc1417jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/food/2024/20240327/e6a2ff7afa79a534065edc82b3bc1417.jpg"><figcaption><em>.

Overconsumption should be avoided as it can lead to digestive issues or decreased appetite and even cause tooth decay or esophageal burns in extreme cases. Some individuals may also experience allergies, potassium depletion, or skin rashes, so intake should be adjusted based on personal health conditions.</p></main>
