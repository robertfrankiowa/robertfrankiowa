    <main><h1>The Secrets of Longevity: 15 Habits of People Who Live to 100</h1><p>As you age, everyday tasks can become more tedious. Taking care of your body, mind, and soul is necessary, not an option.</p><p>Some people need gentle reminders of habits they should be doing, while others must implement life-altering practices. We could all use a little help now and then.</p><p>This curated list blends general reminders with actionable practices everyone can do to live a longer and fitter life. Implementing a healthier lifestyle does wonders for happiness levels.</p><figure><img title="The Secrets of Longevity: 15 Habits of People Who Live to 100" src="IMG/AA1nBupK_the_secrets_of_longevity_15_habits_of_people_who_live_to_100.jpg" alt="The Secrets of Longevity: 15 Habits of People Who Live to 100"><figcaption><em>The Secrets of Longevity: 15 Habits of People Who Live to 100.

Reducing Soda Intake</h2><p>We’ve all heard about how unhealthy soda is for the body, but have you ever thought about the psychological implications? Most people love drinking soda for its sweetened taste and fizzy mouth feel.</p><p>Unfortunately, drinking too much soda may lessen your appreciation for other drinks. After downing several sodas a day, water may seem unfulfilling and lacking. It’s best to stop drinking soda altogether, but limiting your intake is probably more achievable.</p><figure><img title="1.

Eat Unprocessed Food</h2><p>In a nutshell, processed foods are those wildly altered from their original state. They are typically sweetened, enhanced in some way, or modified to taste different. A diet consisting of only processed food is a surefire way to degrade your immune system.</p><p>Processed foods aren’t generally bad for you unless they contain a lot of additives, like salt. Ultra-processed foods include soft drinks, sweetened desserts, and more. For a more nutritious lifestyle, start eating a diet with fruits, vegetables, and other unprocessed foods.</p><figure><img title="2.

Wear Sunscreen</h2><p>If there’s one piece of advice the world needs to know, it’s to wear sunscreen daily. It only takes a few minutes to apply, and it protects our skin. Sunscreen also reduces the risk of skin cancer.</p><p>Besides health benefits, sunscreen is known to slow skin aging and diminish dark circles. Remember to reapply sunscreen to your face if you’re out and about several times a day. It also doesn’t hurt to apply it to your hands and arms.</p><h2>4. Swimming</h2><p>Swimming is simple, enjoyable, adequate exercise, and great for your physique. It’s a full-body workout that shapes your core, arms, shoulders, and more. Also, those who feel they can’t dedicate time to proper strength training should try swimming a few times a week.</p><p>Swimming helps build stamina and energy, making mundane tasks like taking the stairs or walking uphill less demanding. Many report a boost in their energy reserves, which allows them to get more done during the day.</p><h2>5. Consistent Hydration</h2><p>Water is an essential ingredient for your health. It helps with food digestion, skin care, energy maintenance, and weight loss. Our bodies store more water than needed if we don’t drink enough, leading to weight gain.</p><p>Implementing and maintaining a consistent intake of water will significantly improve your life. It only takes a few days for the effects to take place. Reap the benefits and enjoy clearer skin, a healthier body, and a lowered risk of kidney failure.</p><h2>6. Always Wear Your Seatbelts</h2><p>Many people don’t wear their seatbelts or deny their importance. Others believe wearing one is riskier than not doing it. When you’re on the road, you could be doing everything right and still get into a messy situation. Most U.S.-made cars will sound a seatbelt alarm if you don’t wear it, and that alarm becomes increasingly insistent.</p><p>Accidents happen because of human error. You must be prepared for the worst. A seatbelt may mean the difference between life and death. Make it a habit to put one on before beginning to drive. It may seem difficult initially, but watch it transform into muscle memory after a few weeks. Even if you escape being injured in an accident, your insurance company may not pay any benefits if they find out you weren’t wearing your seatbelt.</p><h2>7. Reducing Sugar Intake</h2><p>Adding sugar to foods or coffee does more harm than good. Those on the path to weight loss must steer away from sugar as much as possible. The key is consuming the most nutrients for a limited amount of calories. Adding sugar means free calories but zero nutrients.</p><p>A common excuse for consuming more sugar is that it grants a burst of energy. However, this short-lived energy boost often ends in a big crash. Additionally, consuming sugar later in the day degrades sleep quality.</p><h2>8. Regular Walks</h2><p>Walking is a simple yet effective way to increase mobility and stay active. While not a complete game changer, it best serves those with busy schedules and limited time. It’s also a surprisingly neat way to lose a couple of pounds.</p><p>A sedentary lifestyle affects all parts of life, including health. Walking is an excellent way to break that habit. Those who have neglected minimal exercise may find walking tiresome and should start with shorter distances.</p><h2>9. Fasting</h2><p>Fasting periodically during the day is a great way to lose weight and give your digestive system a break. Midnight snacks and other cravings often have us battling our common sense. Make it a rule not to eat at specific periods of the day.</p><p>It’s essential to ease yourself into the world of fasting. Going all in too early will result in losing focus and energy. The best way is to plan your meals and stick to the daily time. This also helps you build an ideal sleep routine. However, always consult your healthcare provider before implementing any fasting program.</p><h2>10. Sleeping More Than Seven Hours</h2><p>Sleeping is underrated. We aren’t talking about erratic naps, but sleeping between seven and nine hours increases energy levels. Many measure sleep by hours, but is there a better way?</p><p>A typical sleep cycle lasts between 80 to 100 minutes. Napping for a complete cycle means you won’t feel as groggy as waking up in the middle of one. A good night’s rest nearing eight hours is about five sleep cycles. That’s an entire day’s worth of energy and then some.</p><h2>11. Journaling</h2><p>Journaling seems like a practice that requires a lot of work and maintenance. It can help people destress and free their minds from problems. If you write down your emotions on a bad day or even a set of chores, you’ll be better equipped to deal with them.</p><p>Some people opt to journal away from screens on fancy notebooks, while others implement digital solutions. If you struggle with consistency and need reminders, look into Notion or Todoist. Alternatively, if you’re easily distracted, look up bullet journaling techniques.</p><h2>12. Sitting While Wearing Shoes</h2><p>A simple yet healthy habit is sitting while wearing lace-up shoes. We mean sitting on the floor, not on an elevated surface. The major benefits come from attempting to stand up after tying the laces. When you teach yourself to get up consistently, it becomes easier later in life.</p><p>As we get older, our mobility functions begin to decline. Make it a habit to remain flexible and mobile early on. Sitting on the floor may seem like a waste of time, but it will prove helpful later.</p><h2>13. Making Your Bed</h2><p>We should make our bed every day, but many neglect it. Not everyone prioritizes a tidy lifestyle or attention to detail. However, making your bed is more than a lifestyle choice. It’s the first win of the day.</p><p>People who struggle with motivation and progress can start to change that by making their bed. A made bed is a great way to build confidence. Even if you achieve nothing substantial during the day, you still return to a made bed.</p><h2>14. Bodyweight Fitness</h2><p>Bodyweight fitness is an up-and-coming form of exercise. It focuses on mobility, strength training, and flexibility. Bodyweight fitness usually mixes body exercises with minimal equipment use.</p><p>This fitness style is much more accessible than traditional strength training. It requires little or no equipment, and many exercises can be done with everyday items. There are plenty of resources online to study and build a routine.</p><figure><img title="14. Bodyweight Fitness" src="IMG/AA1nBiW1_14_bodyweight_fitness.jpg" alt="14. Bodyweight Fitness"><figcaption><em>14. Bodyweight Fitness. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>15. Challenge Your Intellect</h2><p>Keeping your mind fresh is just as crucial as maintaining physique and mobility. Learning new things is an essential part of life and should never cease.</p><p>One way to keep yourself intellectually occupied is to pick up lifelong habits or hobbies. These can be as stimulating as learning how to solve a Rubik’s cube or as relaxing as knitting. There’s so much to do. The important thing is to start learning it.</p><h2>10 States Americans Are Leaving in Droves and 5 States They Are Moving To</h2><p>Do you know what’s becoming as American as apple pie?
