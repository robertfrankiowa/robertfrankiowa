    <main><h1>The best (and worst) ‘healthy’ ready meals, according to a nutritionist</h1><p>Since the arrival of chicken Kyiv on our supermarket shelves in the late 1970s, ready meals have become a mainstay of the British diet. It’s an industry worth nearly £4 billion in the UK, and 86 per cent of us eat ready meals regularly. And why not? They’re cheap, quick, convenient and a positive boon to busy working people and exhausted parents. </p><p>But, as the old adage goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and in the case of ready meals, the significant downside is that most of them are considered ultra-processed foods (UPFs). They often contain high levels of salt, sugar and fat, and tend to be stuffed full of additives and ingredients that you wouldn’t find in your kitchen and are associated with an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental illness.</p><p>The best way to avoid UPFs is to cook all your meals from scratch, but if you don’t have the time, there are now a plethora of ready meals purporting to be healthy that you can zap in the microwave. But do they taste as good as homemade food and how UPF-free are they really? We put them to the test.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 9/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Field Doctor is a direct-to-consumer range of dietitian-designed, chef-made, nutritionally supercharged frozen meals. </p><p>This meal is well balanced, made with free-range chicken and UPF-free. It contains a whopping 30g of protein, more than half the daily recommendation of 45g (women)/55g (men). <strong>Health score: </strong>5/5 </p><p>It’s no wonder Field Doctor has a Great Taste Award for this product, because it’s delicious and definitely gives homemade vibes. A little more chicken would have been nice. <strong>Taste score: </strong>4/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>As the most expensive of the meal selection tested, it proves that you get what you pay for.</p><p><em>Available online at </em><em>fielddoctor.co.uk</em><em>, £6.95</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 8.5/10 </h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1oeaef_allplants_sticky_teriyaki_udon_noodles.jpg" alt="Allplants, Sticky Teriyaki Udon Noodles"><figcaption><em>Allplants, Sticky Teriyaki Udon Noodles. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The claim:</strong> Healthy plant-based eating made easy with chef-prepared dishes, delivered.</p><p>Apart from the salt being a little high at 2.41g (the maximum should be 6g/day) and the protein a little low at 13.1g (ideally a main meal should contain around 20g), the ingredient list looks healthy enough. <strong>Health score: </strong> 4/5 </p><p>The texture of the udon is perfect and definitely sticky, with proper chunks of veg and some spicy heat that make for a tasty meal. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 4.5/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>As one of the more expensive options, you’d expect it to score highly, but it’s just pipped at the post by Field Doctor due to the higher salt content.</p><p><em>Available online at </em><em>allplants.com</em><em> and from Ocado, £5.95</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 7.5/10 </h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1oe7I5_mindful_chef_panang_chicken_curry.jpg" alt="Mindful chef, Panang Chicken Curry"><figcaption><em>Mindful chef, Panang Chicken Curry. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The claim:</strong> Made with 100 per cent British meat, sustainably sourced fish and free-range chicken, these frozen ready meals are “as balanced as an Olympic gymnast and contain no dairy ingredients or gluten”.</p><p>The ingredients list is impressively straightforward, and the chicken is free-range. At 12g, the saturated fat content is a little higher than the other meals tested (women should have no more than 20g a day and 30g for a man). <strong>Health score:</strong> 4/5  </p><p>A good amount of chilli heat, but not much else to report flavour-wise, and the chicken is a little tough. <strong>Taste score: </strong>3.5/5</p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>This won’t transform you into a gymnast, but it does deliver on its health promise, at a price.</p><p><em>Available online at </em><em>mindfulchef.com</em><em> and Ocado, and at Waitrose, £5.50</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 8/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Scratch makes meal kits and ready meals thta “are high in protein, nutritionally dense and completely accessible for those with active, busy lifestyles.”</p><p>This meal is indeed high in protein at 21g, but it took some work to decipher the nutritional information, which is impressive – except for salt, which at 3g is half your daily allowance. <strong>Health score:</strong> 4/5 </p><p>This tastes fresh and homemade. The flavour is enhanced by the higher salt content, but is it worth the trade-off? Possibly, unless you are watching your salt intake for health reasons. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 4/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>A brand to look out for when you are on the hunt for a quick and tasty convenience option at a more reasonable price. </p><p><em>Available from most major supermarkets, £4</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 7/10 </h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>The Gym Kitchen provides high protein, macro-counted meals for health-conscious, on-the-go individuals.</p><p>It’s a shame to see modified starch – a UPF ingredient that has been changed chemically and physically using enzymes – in the ingredients of this otherwise well-put-together ready meal. The total fat (12.3g) was a little higher than some of the other meals, but with only 1.9g of that being saturated fat it’s not too much of a concern. <strong>Health score:</strong> 3/5 </p><p>The fish is tasty and firm, and the vegetables plentiful with a good bite. The tomato sauce isn’t too sweet, unlike some other ready meals. Perfectly good to eat but not stand-out delicious. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 4/5</p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>Although this has the lowest score of the independents, it is also the cheapest, making it my budget pick. </p><p><em>Available online at </em><em>thegymkitchen.com</em><em> and from most major supermarkets, £2.50</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 8.5/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Really delicious, top-quality dishes, putting in all the love and attention that you would if you were to cook them yourself.</p><p>The list of ingredients is comfortingly familiar for a veggie lasagne, except for soy sauce, which might explain why the salt content is quite high at 2.27g. Otherwise, this is a well-balanced meal with an impressive 19.3g of protein, the highest of the vegetarian meals tested. <strong>Health score:</strong>  4/5 </p><p>You could serve this up and pretend that you’d made it yourself! Delivers on taste, no question, but it has to be cooked in the oven for 40 minutes, so not as convenient as the microwaveable options. <strong>Taste score:</strong>  4.5/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>This particular meal scores well nutritionally, but it’s worth noting that Charlie Bigham’s doesn’t make grand health claims about its meals, so others might not fare so well. The sell here is the quality and freshness of the ingredients and this is reflected in the price. </p><p><em>Available from most major supermarkets, £6</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 7.5/10</h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1oe5Pv_cook_moroccan_spiced_harissa_chicken.jpg" alt="Cook, Moroccan Spiced Harissa Chicken"><figcaption><em>Cook, Moroccan Spiced Harissa Chicken. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Cook uses the same ingredients and techniques that a good cook would use at home, so all food looks and tastes homemade.</p><p>This meal contains a huge 33.9g of protein, but it doesn’t come with any accompanying rice or couscous, so you’d need to factor that into the nutrition of the meal overall. This would help increase the fibre content, which at 4.7g is quite low. It was a surprise to see maltodextrin (a highly processed starch usually used as a thickener) in the list of otherwise healthy ingredients. <strong>Health score:</strong> 4/5 </p><p>This does taste homemade, but it’s not nearly spicy enough – the harissa is barely discernible, and it is quite sweet despite the low sugar content at 1.8g. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 3.5/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>Overall, Cook does offer a quality product at a reasonable price, it’s just a shame there’s an ultra-processed ingredient used in the production.</p><p><em>Available online at </em><em>cookfood.net</em><em> and in COOK stores nationwide, £5.50</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 7/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Eat Well is the M&S health seal of approval given to products meeting evidence-based nutritional criteria, developed by nutritionists in consultation with the British Nutrition Foundation.</p><p>This meal performs well across the board: it’s low in saturated fat, sugar and salt and high in protein. Though it’s a shame about the use of pectin as a stabiliser – you wouldn’t put that in a curry at home. <strong>Health score:</strong> 4/5 </p><p>This meal doesn’t quite deliver on flavour. A little bland, the rice is too soft and the chicken is a bit slimy. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 3/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>As the original purveyor of quality ready meals, it comes as no surprise that this M&S ready meal scored well overall. It’s just a pity it doesn’t pack more of a flavour punch. </p><p><em>Available from M&S stores and Ocado,£4.75</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 7.5/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Created to fit into daily routines and help maintain a balanced lifestyle, with a focus on fresh ingredients.</p><p>Both the salt and fat are a little on the high side, and the lengthy list of ingredients includes chicken extract and chicken fat (why are these needed in a fish curry?) and generic “flavouring”, which could be anything. <strong>Health score:</strong> 3/5</p><p>This scores well for flavour, you can taste all the individual ingredients. While the vegetables and rice still have some bite, the fish is firm and the spicing is spot on. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 4.5/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> Let down by a few ingredients that tipped it into UPF territory. Shame.</p><p><em>Available online and in-store, £4.55</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 6/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>The strapline for the Sainsbury’s Flourish range is “Goodness to Thrive”, with the aim of making “sticking to healthy habits easier”.</p><p>Nutritionally this meal performs well, with very low saturated fat and sugar. Salt is a little high at 25 per cent of RI (reference intake) and it contains only 5.6g fibre (RI is 30g/day). There are no red flag ingredients except for garlic extract – why not use actual garlic? <strong>Health score:</strong>  3.5/5 </p><p>A little too sweet and bland, could use a bit more chilli and the prawns shrank to almost nothing. The pasta is a good texture though. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 2.5/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>Nothing to write home about, but at least the ingredient list didn’t contain anything too worrying. </p><p><em>Available online and in-store, £4</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 6/10 </h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1oe5PG_morrisons_nourish_smokin_chicken_chorizo_paella.jpg" alt="Morrison’s Nourish, Smokin’ Chicken & Chorizo Paella"><figcaption><em>Morrison’s Nourish, Smokin’ Chicken & Chorizo Paella. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The claim: </strong>Delicious food, designed to support, protect and nourish your body from head to toe.</p><p>While this meal is low in fat and sugar and high in protein and fibre, it has 25 per cent of your daily salt allowance. Ingredients such as acacia gum fibre and chicken extract put this firmly in UPF territory. <strong>Health score:</strong> 2.5/5  </p><p>Surprisingly tasty for one of the cheaper options. The rice has a good bite, the smoky chorizo flavour comes through, but it’s let down by the bland and pallid chicken pieces. <strong>Taste score:</strong>  3.5/5</p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>Tasty and reasonable value for money, but it does contain some processed ingredients. </p><p><em>Available online and in-store, £3.75</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 4/10</h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>The new Plant Based range from Asda provides healthy, nutritionist-approved meals as part of its Live Better range of products.</p><p>This meal contains a few watchlist ingredients, such as malted barley extract and onion concentrate, but with low fat and sugar and 12g of fibre it is still relatively healthy. As with the other plant-based options, it is lower in protein at just 10g. <strong>Health score:</strong>  3/5 </p><p>This is a disappointing meal – sloppy, gloopy, bland and with an odd back note of pickled onions, which may be that onion concentrate. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 1/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>This meal has some nutritional merit and is one of the lower-cost options, but ultimately it fails the taste test. </p><p><em>Available online and in-store, £2.85</em></p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Overall: 5.5/10 </h2><p><strong>The claim: </strong>The biggest impact we can make for our health is to eat more plants. At Tesco, we’re making that easier than ever by providing the widest and best range of plant-based options available on the UK high street.</p><p>It was going well until the last ingredient was given simply as “flavouring”, and the total sugar content is the highest of those tested at 31.2g (daily RI for total sugars is 90g). Quite low in protein at just 13g. <strong>Health score:</strong>  2.5/5 </p><p>This tastes overly sweet and with sugar listed in the ingredients it begs the question: why not leave it out? There’s not much curry flavour or any discernible chilli heat. <strong>Taste score:</strong> 3/5 </p><p><strong>In conclusion: </strong>The cheapest of all the meals tested, this is still a relatively healthy plant-based option for students or those on a tight budget.</p><p><em>Available online and in-store, £1.70</em></p><p><em>Recommended</em></p><p>How healthy is your supermarket loaf?
