    <main><h1>10 Benefits of Doing Therapy with Your Dog</h1><h2>Reduced Stress and Anxiety</h2><p>It’s no secret that dogs can make their human friends feel at ease. This is particularly true during therapy sessions since having a therapy dog present may assist in lowering anxiety and stress levels. It has been demonstrated that petting a dog releases feel-good chemicals, including dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, which can help reduce stress.</p><h2>Improved Mood</h2><p>Positive effects on mood can also be obtained from spending time with a therapy dog. According to studies, spending time with animals might enhance the body’s natural mood-enhancing hormone, endorphin synthesis. For those going through difficult times, therapy dogs’ unconditional love and support may be very uplifting.</p><h2>Enhanced Socialization</h2><p>Many patients in therapy may find it difficult to engage with others and may even feel alone. By offering a nonjudgmental presence that can facilitate people’s opening up and communication, therapy dogs can aid in bridging this gap. This may result in more socializing and better communication abilities.</p><h2>Increased Motivation</h2><p>Dogs are remarkably adept at sensing emotions and reacting appropriately, especially when trained as therapy dogs. They can recognize nonverbal clues from their human friends and, when required, offer support and inspiration. Those undergoing treatment may find this particularly beneficial as they struggle with motivation and self-worth.</p><figure><img title="Increased Motivation" src="IMG/BB1oH1fK_increased_motivation.jpg" alt="Increased Motivation"><figcaption><em>Increased Motivation.  photo by dogkind </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Physical Health Benefits</h2><p>Including your dog in therapy sessions can also benefit your physical well-being. According to studies, caressing a dog can reduce heart rate and blood pressure, enhancing cardiovascular health. Playing and walking with a therapy dog can help people become physically active.</p><h2>Reduced Pain Perception</h2><p>Therapy dogs are educated to assist and console people who are experiencing pain. Just having them around has been demonstrated to lessen the sense of pain and suffering. People who are receiving physical treatment or who are suffering from chronic pain may find this very helpful.</p><figure><img title="Reduced Pain Perception" src="IMG/BB1oDUo0_reduced_pain_perception.jpg" alt="Reduced Pain Perception"><figcaption><em>Reduced Pain Perception.

Because you and your pet are collaborating to achieve a common objective, training and working with a therapy dog may give you a feeling of purpose and meaning.</p><h2>Increased Empathy</h2><p>Human empathy has been demonstrated to rise when people interact with animals, which may benefit the healing process. Working closely with a therapy dog can help people better understand emotions and increase their empathy for others.</p><figure><img title="Increased Empathy" src="IMG/BB1oGW8P_increased_empathy.jpg" alt="Increased Empathy"><figcaption><em>Increased Empathy.
