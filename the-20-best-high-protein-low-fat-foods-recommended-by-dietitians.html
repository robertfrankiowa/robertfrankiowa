Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia</strong><p>Protein is an important macronutrient for muscle building and appetite control, two key components of weight maintenance. Fat also plays a role in weight since this macronutrient helps slow down digestion, keeping you full between meals. However, fat has more calories per gram than protein and carbohydrates: 1 gram of fat has 9 calories, whereas protein and carbs provide 4 calories per gram. </p><p>While not everything comes down to calories in and calories out when you’re trying to lose weight, a calorie deficit is needed to achieve your goals. Yet, macronutrients don’t exist in isolation, and most foods contain more than one. Many high-protein foods also contain fat and carbohydrates. So, choosing the right foods can be tricky for those looking to boost their protein intake without getting too much fat. That said, there are four types of dietary fats: saturated, trans, monosaturated and polyunsaturated. Consuming the first two in excess may increase your risk of heart disease, while the latter may help reduce it.</p><p>Luckily, this list compiles the best high-protein foods that are also low in fat, especially in saturated fat. We will also look at the benefits of afternoon and evening exercise and how it can help you with your weight and fitness goals. </p><h2>1.
