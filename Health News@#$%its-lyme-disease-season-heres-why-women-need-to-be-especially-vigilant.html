The downside is that it's also the time of year ticks tend to be most active. With that, there's a greater risk of developing Lyme disease if you live in certain parts of the country. </p><p>Estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that 476,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year. Like all conditions, there is a range with how someone experiences Lyme disease. But some data suggest that women may be more likely to struggle with more severe Lyme symptoms than men. Here's what you need to know about Lyme disease symptoms in women, plus how to stay safe out there in the hot weather this summer. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Lyme disease and how does it develop?</strong></h2><p>Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacteria <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> and, in some rare cases, <em>Borrelia mayonii</em>, according to the CDC. It's spread to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick, and happens most commonly in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and upper-Midwest areas of the country. </p><p>Symptoms usually include fever, headache, fatigue, and a skin rash called erythema migrans that often appears red and circular. If it's not treated, a Lyme disease infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. That can lead to headaches and neck stiffness, facial palsy, arthritis, heart palpitations, dizziness, and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. </p><p>It's important to point out that you won't get Lyme disease every time you have a tick bite. "Every tick, fortunately, is not infected," says William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Lyme disease is also only found in some parts of the country, although the parts where the disease is found are growing, he points out. </p><p>"There are specific species of ticks that transmit bacteria that causes Lyme disease," says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "Not every tick that a person finds on their body is the correct tick to transmit the bacteria." </p><p>Also worth noting, according to Dr. Adalja: It takes some time for a tick to be able to transmit Lyme disease to you. In most cases, a tick must be attached for more than 24 hours before it can spread the Lyme disease bacterium, the CDC says. So, if you happen to spot it and remove it before then, you should be fine. If you do end up with an infection, Lyme disease is usually treated with a few weeks of antibiotics, Dr. Schaffner says. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why might Lyme be more dangerous for women?</strong></h2><p>It's important to point out that research into symptoms of Lyme disease in women is ongoing. But several studies have found that women have a different experience with Lyme disease than men. Research has found that women tend to have more severe symptoms of the disease and are also more likely to have their symptoms be dismissed or misdiagnosed as a psychiatric condition or another chronic illness. As a result, they can go untreated for longer periods of time and end up sicker than if they were diagnosed sooner. </p><p>Women also seem to be four times more likely to develop Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS), a condition in which someone has lingering symptoms due to Lyme disease. That condition can manifest in things like chronic fatigue and memory issues, and have long-term effects on a person's life, according to the CDC. </p><p>But it's not clear why this may be the case and, again, this is still being studied. "Given its similarities to long COVID, [which affects significantly more women than men] it's not surprising to see [Lyme disease] be more common in females than males," Dr. Adalja says. "The biology of this skew is unclear, as the biology of persistent Lyme symptoms also remains unclear."  </p><p>More research is needed to understand why it’s biologically affecting more women, according to Dr. Schaffner. "One of the things we haven't studied nearly enough is the difference between males and females in getting certain infectious diseases," he says. "This merits further investigation."</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to prevent Lyme this summer</strong></h2><p>The best way to avoid Lyme disease is to do your best to avoid getting bit by an infected tick. There are unfortunately no Lyme disease vaccines available, but doctors say there are a few steps you can take to lower your risk. That includes doing your best to avoid wooded, brushy, and grassy areas, even in your own backyard, Dr. Schaffner says. </p><p>It can be helpful to wear light-colored clothes so that you can see ticks that might end up on you. Using insect repellents that are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can also be helpful in tick prevention, Dr. Schaffner says. If you’re out hiking, walking in the center of trails to avoid touching brush and grass can lower your risk, too, along with tossing your clothes in the wash and drying it on a high temperature once you're home. </p><p>Doctors also stress the importance of doing tick checks when you come inside. "Check yourself and then have somebody look at your back and the back of your hair, where they like to be," Dr. Schaffner says. (If nobody is available, you can use a hand mirror to help you look.)</p><p>If you spot a tick on your body, remove it as soon as you can by grasping it near where it's attached with a tissue or tweezers and gently pulling upward. Then, flush the tick, put it in alcohol, or place it in a sealed bag or container, and get rid of it. You'll also want to clean the bite area well with rubbing alcohol or soap and water, the CDC says. </p><p>One thing you don't need to do is to get on antibiotics right away if you have a tick bite, according to Dr. Schaffner. "Antibiotics prophylaxis - which is trying to prevent an illness by taking antibiotics before you develop symptoms - has not been shown to be effective in preventing illness." He also recommends keeping in mind that not all ticks and not all tick bites will automatically put you at risk for tickborne infections. </p><p>Symptoms of Lyme disease can take between three and 30 days to show up, so keep an eye out over the next month or so. If you happen to get sick, call your doctor right away and make sure to tell them that you were recently bit by a tick. They should be able to take things from there and ensure that you’re treated and can keep Lyme disease from progressing this summer. </p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
