The itch may be mild and hardly noticeable or bad enough that it’s hard to concentrate on other things. </p><p>Oftentimes, an itchy beard or beard rash is nothing too concerning and can be remedied at home, though sometimes it may be a sign of an infection that needs medical attention. It’s important to take good care of your beard to keep both your beard and skin healthy.</p><p>This article discusses what causes an itchy beard and tips to find relief.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1ncHL9_person_itchy_beard.jpg" alt="person itchy beard"><figcaption><em>Ted Horowitz Photography / Getty Images.

While it may seem like your beard doesn’t need much attention, it’s important to make sure the skin under your beard is healthy. Proper skin care can prevent problems like an itchy beard. </p><p>An itchy beard can be caused by a spectrum of skin problems, from dry skin to harboring a skin infection.</p><h3>Dry Skin</h3><p>An itchy beard might be a sign that you have dry skin. Dehydrated skin lacks moisture and may look dry or parched. Dry skin can also cause an itchy face. </p><p>While it may be hard to see dry skin if it’s covered by a beard, itchiness might be a sign that your skin needs care and moisturization. </p><h3>Folliculitis</h3><p>Folliculitis is when one or more hair follicles become blocked or damaged, leading to inflammation. Shaving or wearing something that constantly rubs on the skin, such as a face mask or scarf, can cause folliculitis. Such irritation of the hair follicles makes them prone to becoming inflamed. Itchiness is a common symptom of folliculitis as are pustules or pimples that may crust over.</p><p>"Folliculitis barbae" is the term used to describe folliculitis in areas of the body that are shaved, such as the beard area. Sycosis barbae is a complication of folliculitis barbae and may lead to scarring and hair loss in the affected area. </p><h3>Pseudofolliculitis Barbae</h3><p>Also known as razor bumps, pseudofolliculitis barbae is inflammation of the hair follicles, usually on the face as a result of shaving or grooming the facial hair. Using a razor with blades, as opposed to an electric shaver, can make the skin prone to pseudofolliculitis barbae.</p><p>People with tight, curly facial hair are more prone to pseudofolliculitis barbae, and most often occurs in people of African descent. The end of the hair is more likely to curve back into the skin and cause an inflammatory reaction. </p><h3>Seborrheic Dermatitis</h3><p>Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin condition in which a scaly rash develops where there is oily skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can look like dandruff, but unlike dandruff, it develops on more than just the scalp, including the beard, and may cause swelling and discoloration of the skin. The scales that develop may be itchy and greasy or dry.</p><h3>Tinea Barbae</h3><p>Tinea barbae is an infection of the beard area with a type of fungus that comes from animals, such as tinea mentagrophytes var. equinum (from horses) and tinea verrucosum (from cattle). Tinea barbae most often affects farmers. Although the lumps and pustules that result may look bad, they are usually not that itchy or painful.</p><h3>Staph Infection</h3><p>The beard can also become infected with <em>Staphylococcus </em>(staph) bacteria. A staph infection of the hair follicles in the beard area, especially the upper lip, is known as barber’s itch. The infected skin may be swollen, red, painful, or crust over. Shaving makes the infection worse.</p><h3>Pubic Lice (Crabs)</h3><p>Pubic lice, also known as crabs, are named as such because they show up in the genital area, but lice can also be found in other parts of the body, including the mustache and beard. The lice or lice eggs are usually visible and cause itchiness.</p><h2>Itchy Beard Relief at Home</h2><p>Depending on the cause of your itchy beard, you may be able to get rid of the itch at home and prevent it from happening again in the future. Itchiness that is caused by an infection should be treated by a healthcare professional.</p><h3>Proper Hygiene and Beard Care</h3><p>Caring for your beard through proper hygiene and skin care can help prevent skin problems that lead to an itchy beard, such as dry skin. The American Academy of Dermatology Association recommends several ways to keep your beard and the skin under it healthy, including:</p><ul><li>Wash your face and beard every day.</li><li>Avoid touching your beard to prevent dirt and germs from getting on your skin.</li><li>Use moisturizer on your face and beard after you wash it.</li><li>Exfoliate your skin once or twice a week if you have stubble and get ingrown hairs.</li></ul><h3>Shaving Tips</h3><p>Since razor blades are more likely to cause inflammation of the hair follicles, consider grooming your beard with an electric shaver instead. Make sure to move the razor/shaver in the direction the hair grows—not against the grain. In addition, it’s best to shave when your hair is soft, such as after a warm shower, and moisturize your beard with a beard conditioner or beard oil right after shaving.</p><h2>How to Stop Beard Itch: Medical Treatments</h2><p>If an itchy beard doesn’t go away with at-home remedies—or you think you might have an infection—it’s time to talk to a healthcare provider about medical treatments.</p><h3>Medication</h3><p>If your beard itches due to a fungal or bacterial infection, you may need to take medications or use a special ointment as recommended by a healthcare provider. For example, mild cases of tinea barbae are often treated with a topical antifungal cream, and staph infections are treated with an antibiotic medication or ointment.</p><p>If at-home remedies don’t resolve the cause of an itchy beard, a healthcare provider may recommend more involved medical treatment. It's rare that an itchy beard will require a medical procedure, and some procedures are noninvasive. For example, photodynamic therapy and certain laser treatments may be used to treat pseudofolliculitis barbae.</p><h2>How Long Does an Itchy Beard Last?</h2><p>An itchy beard may be temporary or ongoing, depending on the cause and how well it responds to treatment. For example, folliculitis usually goes away soon after treatment, but it can keep coming back. </p><p>Treating underlying skin issues, such as dry skin, with ongoing skin care and using good shaving techniques can help reduce the itchiness and keep it from returning.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>An itchy beard can be uncomfortable and distracting. There are several causes of itchiness in facial hair, from dry skin, irritation, and skin infections. Getting rid of the itch depends on the cause and might include adopting a proper skin care routine or temporarily taking medication.</p></main>
