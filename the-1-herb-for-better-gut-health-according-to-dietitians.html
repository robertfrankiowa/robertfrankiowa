Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Alyssa Pike, RDN</strong><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Alyssa Pike, RDN</strong><p>Gut health is a hot topic—and, quite frankly, for good reason. Your gastrointestinal system doesn’t just digest your food, it also houses your unique microbiome, or the trillions of bacteria and microbes that reside within your gut. To say it’s kind of a big deal would be an understatement. </p><p>Whether you struggle with a digestive condition like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or you’re simply a health enthusiast who is eager to care for your gut health, we’ve got you covered. Leading gut-health dietitians have shared their No.1 herb to add to your diet if gut health is on your radar.</p><h2>Why Is Gut Health Important? </h2><p>Feeling sick, tired, fatigued, irritable, moody? If any of these sound like something you’ve experienced before, then it’s time to take a closer look at your gut health. Feeding and fueling your microbiome to the fullest is crucial for not only your physical well-being, but your mental well-being, too. </p><p>Research has continued to show a direct impact of the gut on both health and disease–even suggesting that a healthy microbiome plays a role in longevity.,One study found that people who tend to live the longest consume more fiber, and as a result, have microbiomes that resemble those of much younger people. (It’s safe to say that fiber is our favorite F-word!) </p><p>“Prioritizing a healthy gut is crucial for several reasons, including digestive efficiency, immune support and mental health and mood regulation,” says Jessie Wong, RDN, a gut-health dietitian and founder of Poopedia, a website devoted to improving poop consistency. “Having a healthy gut optimizes the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, ensuring that the body gets the essential vitamins and minerals it needs for overall health and functioning,” she says.  </p><p>In addition, gut health is also important for disease prevention and management. “Given the microbiome is responsible for the inflammatory response, it’s crucial to optimize your gut health to prevent chronic inflammation that can occur in diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes,” says Beth Rosen, M.S., RD, owner of Beth Rosen Nutrition. “Plus, a balanced microbiome can help to reduce constipation, diarrhea, gas and bloating in digestive disease diagnoses,” she says.</p><h2>The No. 1 Herb for Gut Health </h2><p>It’s mint! This small but mighty herb packs a flavorful punch of nutrition in every bite. According to gut-health experts, mint is the No. 1 herb you need to add to your eating plan.</p><p>But, just why is this popular flavor in toothpaste and chewing gum so stellar when it comes to gut health? Mint has properties that help reduce inflammation and stomach cramping and can kill harmful microorganisms, says Wong. </p><p>Mint is the general term given to the family of plants that exhibit that minty-fresh feeling you’ve come to know. While two of the most common forms of mint you’ve likely encountered include spearmint and peppermint, the latter is the one most frequently encountered when you hear mint and gut health combined. </p><p>In fact, research has found that peppermint oil, for example, can help relieve digestive discomfort in people who have IBS, as well as quell indigestion—and it’s been shown to be safe to use for short-term relief., “Mint’s antispasmodic properties help relax the muscles of the digestive tract, while its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects promote a balanced gut environment,” says Wong. </p><p>It is worth noting that doses used in research don’t exactly translate to the same mint we’d use in a kitchen. Meaning you can’t expect a leaf of mint to alleviate symptoms associated with IBS overnight. However, drinking mint tea has been used to alleviate stomach pain and nausea. If you are interested in using something stronger, like peppermint oil, talk to your doctor before using supplements to make sure they’re safe for you. </p><p>Mint is a great choice, but it’s not the only herb that bodes well for your GI tract. “Other herbs like ginger, turmeric and fennel also offer substantial benefits. It’s essential to adopt a holistic approach, incorporating a variety of herbs and foods to support overall gut health,” says Wong.</p><h2>Tips for Including Mint in a Healthy Eating Pattern</h2><p>Adding fresh mint into a healthy eating pattern doesn’t require a trip to a specialist. “While using fresh mint leaves may not reproduce the same effects seen in clinical trials, it still adds a refreshing flavor to dishes,” says Wong.</p><p>With that in mind, Wong recommends clients use three to five fresh mint leaves in recipes. “This amount is a good starting point for adding freshness and a mild digestive benefit to their meals,” says Wong.</p><p>Rosen agrees, adding that peppermint can also be steeped as a tea. One thing to keep in mind is being careful with mint if you have acid reflux. Mint can be a trigger for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), especially if you consume a lot of it. Understanding how mint affects you will be important for deciding how to include it in your eating plan. “While this may irritate those with GERD, for others it can help alleviate indigestion and nausea,” says Wong.</p><p>To get you started on your journey using mint in your own kitchen, first and foremost, store it properly. This can be done on the counter or in the fridge, as long as you follow these tips for storing fresh mint. Next, try fresh mint in a variety of gut-healthy recipes, such as Lemon, Cucumber & Mint Infused Water, Green Jasmine-Mint Iced Tea with Lemon and Strawberry Chicken Salad with Mint & Goat Cheese.</p><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p>Mint is a powerful herb that has shown to have beneficial properties that bode well for gut health. Not only is it easy to toss into recipes during the summer months, it’s also a wonderful flavor enhancer to upgrade water. Consider stocking up on fresh mint and other herbs and spices during your next grocery haul and, we promise, your gut will thank you.</p></main>
