    <main><h1>Get Snatched With These 5 Everyday Habits</h1><p>Now that the summer season is here, so is the summer heat. We tend to dress down to stay cool, but some of us are not that confident in showing certain parts of our bodies due to our weight. </p><p>But worry no more dearest readers. Add these 5 habits into your everyday routine to help you feel better! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. What’s for Breakfast? Protein</h2><p>Did you know that having a high-protein breakfast can help reduce body fat, daily intake, and hunger? </p><p>A study found that people who had just 12g of protein in their breakfast lost more weight compared to those who had a regular breakfast. When your body gets enough protein, it starts breaking it down into amino acids. These will increase the levels of hormones that signal fullness, promoting weight loss.</p><p>Even if weight loss isn’t your goal, a high-protein breakfast can help ensure you get enough iron and fiber. Here are some recommended high-protein breakfast foods:</p><ul> <li> Eggs</li>    <li> Grilled pork or chicken breast</li>    <li> Bacon</li>    <li> Black beans</li>    <li> Greek yogurt</li>    <li> Cottage cheese</li>    <li> Protein powder</li>    <li> Nuts (especially oats)</li>    <li> Salmon</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Stay Hydrated </h2><p>Drinking water can help reduce your appetite and food intake. It also helps burn calories by digesting the water itself, aiding in weight loss. However, the amount of water needed can vary depending on your weight and age. Instead of a fixed amount, adjust your intake based on your body’s needs.</p><p>On average, men should drink 2500ml (about 85 oz) and women 2000ml (about 68 oz) per day, not solely from water but also fruits and beverages. The best method is to drink water regularly throughout the day. Keeping water visible encourages you to drink more. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Get at Least 6 Hours of Sleep</h2><p>Lack of sleep is linked to increased appetite. Not getting enough rest not only increases stress but also negatively impacts weight loss. Sleep deprivation dulls the activity of the prefrontal cortex, which helps control behavior, making it hard to resist high-calorie foods.</p><p>Graveyard shift workers often opt for high-calorie fast food because lack of sleep increases blood sugar levels after meals, boosts hunger hormones, and decreases appetite-suppressing hormones, promoting overeating. Combining these factors can lead to a desire for high-calorie foods and binge eating.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Walk or Bike to Work at Least Twice a Week </h2><p>Driving is convenient but not so great for your back. Walking or biking to work, or at least using public transportation, can help burn more calories.</p><p>If you commute for about an hour by car, switching to public transport can burn nearly twice as many calories as driving. Cycling and using stairs during your commute will increase calorie consumption even more.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Take a Photo of What You Ate </h2><p>Busy people rarely remember what they ate yesterday or today. Keeping a food diary to track what you eat throughout the day can help promote weight loss and accountability. Knowing the types and quantities of foods you eat, including snacks, helps you see if your diet is high in carbs, low in protein, or lacks enough fruits and vegetables. This can help you reduce unnecessary calorie intake.</p><p>Regular and honest monitoring of what you eat not only helps with weight loss but also encourages healthier eating habits. If writing down everything you eat is difficult, taking photos can be an effective alternative.</p></main>
