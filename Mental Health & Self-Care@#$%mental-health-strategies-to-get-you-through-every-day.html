    <main><h1>Mental health strategies to get you through every day</h1><p>Mental health has come into acute focus in recent months. Regardless of what is going on in the world around you, however, taking care of yourself should be non-negotiable. That isn't a revolutionary statement. Maybe you've even heard all of these tips before. But it never hurts to be reminded every once in a while. With that in mind, here's a refresher course on mental health strategies to help get you through every day.</p><figure><img title="Mental health strategies to get you through every day" src="IMG/BB1dH2Ar_mental_health_strategies_to_get_you_through_every_day.jpg" alt="Mental health strategies to get you through every day"><figcaption><em>Mental health strategies to get you through every day.

When put into that context, the thought of spending the 30 measly minutes after waking up without looking at a screen shouldn't be daunting at all. This is 2021, however, so of course it seems impossible. </p><p>Tomorrow morning, when your first impulse after opening your eyes—or even before you open your eyes—is to reach for your phone, don't. Think instead of what it might feel like to take deep breaths, let your mind naturally wake up and ground yourself in the moment before the day gets away from you.</p><h2>Eat a healthy breakfast</h2><p>Now that your mind is clear—emails or texts being kept at bay just for a little while longer—try to make yourself a healthy breakfast. In the Time Before COVID-19, this would be a much more difficult ask because you'd probably be rushing to get out the door. But right now? We're hardly going anywhere. We're working from home. We have time to whip up a meal before—or, hey, maybe even during—the next Zoom call. Coffee, eggs, fruit, yogurt. Take your pick. WebMD has done us the courtesy of laying out several recipe ideas complete with nutrition information.</p><h2>Make a to-do list</h2><p>Lay out what you need and want to do with your day in traditional to-do list form. It can be on paper, which we'll get to later, or in the Notes app on your phone. It doesn't necessarily matter where you write it down because having it exist somewhere outside your jumbled brain will help you be more productive, and in turn, feel better about yourself. </p><h2>But be OK with spontaneity</h2><p>So, you have your to-do list. You have every intention of checking off each task. You'll probably get more done than you would have otherwise. This is great! Just make sure you don't beat yourself up if your day goes a little off track. If things pop up that weren't part of your plan. Sometimes, the spontaneous moments turn out to be the ones that make you smile the most.</p><h2>Use a pen and paper</h2><p>There's something extremely stimulating about sitting down and putting pen to paper. This is true enough that doctors have conducted plenty of studies to prove the medical benefits, which Mental Floss summed up in 2015 as better for learning, better for writing, limiting distractions and keeping the brain sharper.</p><h2>Get artsy</h2><p>No, this doesn't mean you need to become a trained pianist or the next Bob Ross. Nobody ever needs to see this project. It can be as simple as doodling aimlessly, painting or writing a story. Allow your brain to activate its imagination and see what comes out. Think of it as a relief valve.</p><h2>Find a good therapist</h2><p>There's a difference between therapy and <em>good </em>therapy. Once you find the therapist who is right for you, it can be life-changing. There's a played out stigma around therapy, but the truth is, you don't have to qualify your reason for wanting to seek out a therapist. </p><h2>Fresh air</h2><p>In the past, this would have seemed almost too obvious to mention because everyday life used to take us outside at least once. But now? Locked inside to avoid a deadly virus? You might need reminding that there is nothing like the endorphin rush from simply going on a walk or sitting on a bench—socially distanced, of course—and breathing in fresh air.</p><h2>Move your body</h2><p>While you're outside in the fresh out, you might as well get your heart rate up. Simply being outside can do wonders for mental health, but getting in a good sweat at the same time takes it to another level. Not to mention, you'll be tending to your mental <em>and </em>physical health.</p><figure><img title="Move your body" src="IMG/BB1dH4FI_move_your_body.jpg" alt="Move your body"><figcaption><em>Move your body.

Take some time—and challenge yourself to reduce your time—away from more serious stressors by indulging in a tried and true activity. </p><h2>Indulge in a hobby</h2><p>Collect smiles wherever you can get them. Carve time out in your day to simple do something you enjoy with no strings attached—no expectations, no productivity, no means to an end other than your happiness. </p><figure><img title="Indulge in a hobby" src="IMG/AA1kVgXB_indulge_in_a_hobby.jpg" alt="Indulge in a hobby"><figcaption><em>Indulge in a hobby.

And there is a such thing as mostly harmless vices. Chocolate isn't bad in moderation, for example. Food Network was kind enough to compile a list for healthy desserts for this very purpose.</p><figure><img title="Identify healthier vices" src="IMG/BB1dGR8t_identify_healthier_vices.jpg" alt="Identify healthier vices"><figcaption><em>Identify healthier vices.

However, there are still ways to connect with the people you love. There is Zoom, which none of us knew existed prior to the pandemic but now can't avoid. There's also just the phone. Calling somebody has been an effective way to connect since the beginning of time. And if you and your family or friends are verifiably COVID-free, then there is no harm in a safe, private get-together. </p><h2>Rest</h2><p>The the easiest thing you can do for yourself is nothing. Close your eyes. Let your body and mind recharge. It's as simple as that. If you're lucky, you'll have a good dream in the process.</p><h2>Find a cause you care about</h2><h2>Practice self-talk</h2><p>You have all unwillingly been reminded that you're all you got. Pandemic or not, you will not spend time with anybody more than yourself. It's up to you to make sure that it's time well spent. Your mental health begins from within, so do your best with your inner monologue. That doesn't mean you have to lie to yourself—sugarcoat things—but it never hurts to give yourself a break. While you are your own narrator, and there's power in that, you are also probably you're own harshest critic.</p><h2>Clean</h2><p>Is that you audibly sighing? Rolling your eyes? Look, cleaning is never an appealing option at the outset. But the feeling after a good housecleaning is worth it. More than a feeling, there are proven benefits to cleaning your home.</p><h2>Then re-organize</h2><p>You're stuck in the house more than usual. Most of us feel stuck in a rut. Do yourself a favor and simulate a fresh start by reorganizing your living space. Or, depending on who you are, organize it for the first time. Either way, it feels good. </p><h2>Fall down an interesting rabbit hole</h2><p>Your physical parameters have shrunk, but the internet is a limitless playground. The next time you have extra time on your hands, fall down one of the billion rabbit holes at your disposal. Laugh at something silly. Learn something new. Repurpose your doomscrolling.</p><h2>Hold onto gratitude</h2><p>There are multiple little reasons every single day to be grateful. They get lost in the shuffle because there are also a mounting list of things to stress over. But you can't let the latter win. Did you just take a breath? There's one thing right there.</p><h2>Look forward to something</h2><p>Fill your calendar up, even if the events aren't things that you would normally circle. It doesn't have to be flashy or exceptionally exciting; all you need is the knowledge that you have <em>something</em> to look forward to. </p><h2>Pair your healthy breakfast with a well-rounded dinner</h2><p>Breakfast is traditionally known as the most important meal of the day. That doesn't give you permission to neglect dinner. Once again, Food Network to the rescue.</p><h2>Soak in the tub</h2><p>Something tells us we won't have to twist your arm on this one. Is there anything more relaxing than a good soak? The Cleveland Clinic has vouched for the mental health benefits of taking a hot bath, including an improved ability to sleep well.</p><h2>Breathe</h2><p>We breathe without realizing it. Breathing is a natural reflex, you know, because oxygen is necessary to sustain life and all. There's a difference between breathing and intentionally breathing, though. Take your pick from these apps for further guidance. </p><h2>End on a favorite note</h2><p>What's your favorite movie or television show? Watch it. Do you love to read? End your day with a good book. Whatever it is that you love to do—whatever your favorite things are—incorporate them as your final act of each day, so you can go to bed with a pure smile on your face and some peace of mind.</p></main>
