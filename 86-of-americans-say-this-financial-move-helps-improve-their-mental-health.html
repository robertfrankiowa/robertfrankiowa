But when you don't have it, or don't feel like you have a handle on it, it can mess with your mental health. </p><p>In a recent survey by Self, 86% of Americans surveyed said having control over their money helps improve their mental health. So it pays to do what you can to get a handle on your money. Here's how.</p><h2>Start with a budget -- if you have the patience for it</h2><p>One reason so many people find themselves financially stressed is because they live paycheck to paycheck with no money in a savings account to fall back on. That's really not a good way to function (though sometimes it unfortunately can't be helped). </p><p>A better bet is to have a financial cushion in the form of an emergency fund. And many financial experts will tell you that your emergency fund should have enough money to pay for at least three months of essential bills, like groceries and rent.</p><p>But to get to that level of savings, you'll need to take control of your money. And budgeting is a good way to do that -- even if it's not the most fun. </p><p>Interestingly enough, in the aforementioned survey, almost 50% of respondents said they've created a budgeting spreadsheet to take control of their money. Whether they kept up with those spreadsheets is a different story.</p><p>But the reality is that budgeting can be boring, annoying, and time-consuming. And, frankly, it doesn't always work.</p><p>Thankfully, there's another thing you can do to take the place of budgeting, and it's setting up automatic transfers into your savings. <b>Figure out how much money you can afford to part with each month, and set up a recurring transfer so that sum is taken out of your</b> <b>checking account</b><b> regularly.</b></p><p>The whole purpose of having a budget is to take control of your money and work toward your financial goals. Automating your savings really does the same thing, only without the hassle and extra work.</p><h2>Don't let financial stress ruin your outlook</h2><p>It's hard to feel good in general when you're constantly worried about money. If that's where you're at, getting into the habit of saving money -- even if it's just a small amount at a time -- could really work wonders for your outlook. </p><p>Of course, if you're willing to set up and follow a budget, more power to you. It's certainly not a bad thing to do. And it's good to know exactly where your money is going month after month. But if budgeting isn't for you, you should know that it's not your only option for getting a handle on your finances and improving your mental health as a result.</p><h2>Alert: highest cash back card we've seen now has 0% intro APR until nearly 2025</h2><p>If you're using the wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money. Our experts love this top pick, which features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee. </p><p>In fact, this card is so good that our experts even use it personally.
