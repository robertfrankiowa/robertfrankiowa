So what can we do to protect our skin?</p><p>According to Emma, it’s all about limiting your shower time.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How long should you spend in the shower?</h2><p>‘Many people are spending too long in the shower, the optimal time spent should be <strong>less than ten minutes</strong>,’ she tells Metro.co.uk.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1ojgUP_woman_applying_moisturser_after_a_shower.jpg" alt="Woman applying moisturser after a shower."><figcaption><em>Moisturiser helps too (Picture: Getty Images).

To stop the irritation, you need to remedy the dryness with a product that can replenish skin’s moisture and lock it in. </p><p>‘Products such as Dove’s Advanced Care Body Wash, that, can help to boost and retain moisture levels in the skin post shower.’</p></main>
