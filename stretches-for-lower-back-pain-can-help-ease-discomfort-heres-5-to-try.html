The practice feels good because the act of stretching activates a network of relaxing and calming nerves and increases blood flow to one's muscles. Stretching also releases endorphins that boosts one's mood and alleviates pain.</p><p>But some areas of the body are easier to stretch than others. Hamstrings, quads, triceps and neck muscles, for instances, are popular muscle groups to stretch and relatively simple to target. One's lower back muscles, by contrast, can be a more difficult area to stretch effectively, especially for anyone struggling with lower back pain.</p><p>Experts weigh in on the best way to stretch one's lower back − and when to avoid doing so. </p><p><strong><em>Start the day smarter.

"Stretching the muscles of your lower back and surrounding regions can help improve mobility and aid in injury prevention," says Stephen Dering, PT, an orthopedic clinical specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Many of the injuries I encounter in the clinic can be prevented with proper warm-up including stretching and strengthening techniques," he adds. </p><p><p class="oembed-link-desc">Is creatine safe?

"Some elements of your back will respond well to certain movements or stretches, while others may respond poorly," he explains. "For this reason there is no universal set of stretches that will improve everyone’s pain."</p><p>But there are common lower back stretches that work for many people who have tried the following:</p><ul><li> Kneel on all fours with your hands and knees hip-width apart, then round your back muscles up, pushing your spine towards the ceiling while holding the pose for 5 seconds. Then exhale while you drop your back and belly down again. Repeat the motion in both directions, inhaling and exhaling each way. </li><li>Lie on your back and lift your knees towards your chest in turn. Hold each knee with both hands for 30 seconds at a time, making sure to breathe out while relaxing your legs, hips and spine. Repeat three times with each leg. Frost says a targeted variation of this stretch can also be done by using both hands to bring each knee across your body and toward the ground. "This will cause the pelvis and spine to rotate to the opposite direction," he says. </li><li>Another common lying position stretch is called the pelvic tilt and is performed as its name implies. Simply lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat and hands behind your neck as if you were about to perform a sit up. Then, gently arch your lower back, tilting your pelvis up slightly towards the ceiling. Hold the pose for 5-10 seconds at a time and then repeat.</li><li>Sit in a chair and grasp the right arm of the chair with your left hand, then slide the other arm behind the back of the chair. "In this position, you can revolve while keeping your back straight," explains Fishman. "Hold the revolved position for 30 seconds, then reverse in the other direction," he advises. </li><li>Another sitting position stretch that targets one's lower back can be done by sitting on the edge of a chair with your knees open, then fold forward to reach toward the ground while keeping your bottom in place on the chair. Hold the pose for 30 seconds while relaxing your breathing, then repeat. </li></ul><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Should I stretch my lower back if it hurts? </h2><p>Such stretching exercises are best for stretching and targeting "garden variety lower back pain," says Fishman. That's the kind of back tension or muscle spasm that commonly results from extended periods of sitting or from excessive bending or leaning over. Stretching through such pain is OK, says Frost, within limits. "A mild increase in discomfort when you stretch is fine, so long as it remains mild and does not last for more than 20-30 min after you stretch," he explains. "If you are having more intense pain when you stretch and it lasts for hours after you get done, it would probably be best to stop the stretches you are doing and consult a professional," he adds. </p><p>It's also important to remember that some medical conditions require one to avoid lower back stretches completely. These include sacroiliac joint derangement, piriformis syndrome and scoliosis, Fishman says. Still other conditions can be helped with lower back stretches, but usually require special techniques to ensure no harm is done to the affected area. "The best way to stretch your lower back always depends on what is wrong with it," Fishman explains. For instance, someone with spinal stenosis will need to stretch their back muscles completely differently than someone with a herniated disc. </p><p>"If an individual is unsure what stretches they should be implementing for their lower back," councils Dering, "I recommend consulting a healthcare provider such as a physical therapist who can instruct them on the safest and most beneficial forms of the exercise." </p></main>
