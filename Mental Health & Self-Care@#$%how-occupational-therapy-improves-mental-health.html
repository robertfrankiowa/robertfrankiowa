However, the benefits of occupational therapy go well beyond these physical tasks. Occupational therapy is also shown to improve mental health—one more way therapists are changing lives for the better and another reason to consider a career in this growing field.  </p><h2>Physical Challenges and Mental Health Struggles: What’s the Connection?</h2><p>Occupational therapiststreat clients of all ages with physical, cognitive, or sensory challenges. Clients who have difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), like eating, bathing, and dressing, are at risk of decreased mental health, according to one study of more than 100,000 participants. </p><p>Chronic illness, which often impacts ADLs, is also associated with: </p><ul> <li>Feeling helpless or worthless</li> <li>Sadness, anxiousness, or emptiness</li> <li>Loss of interest in hobbies </li> <li>Persistent fatigue, feeling run down </li> <li>Appetite and weight change</li> <li>Difficulty with concentration and decision-making </li> </ul><p>Occupational therapy can be a valuable tool in a holistic plan to manage and improve mental health conditions. In fact, occupational therapy traces its roots back to the 18th century when caregivers noticed improvements in clients with mental illness who engaged in meaningful and productive daily activities. </p><h2>Improving Health and Wellness with Occupational Therapy</h2><p>Clients may feel anxious, frightened, or saddened by their “new normal” when tasks that were once so simple suddenly become harder. They may have fear about their prognosis and questions about how their condition will affect their ability to maintain their independence. </p><p>Let’s explore how therapy helps clients move and function more effectively in their environment and how occupational therapists help improve mental health in a few key ways. </p><h3>Education</h3><p>Clients may need more information about their diagnosis from their providers, which can leave them feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. Occupational therapists help clients understand their condition. </p><p>They educate patients on what to expect, including possible symptoms and treatment options, and encourage each patient to play an active role in their own care. Patients who are knowledgeable about their condition and engaged in decision-making may have less anxiety, which is linked to better overall outcomes. </p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Therapists help clients develop independent skills, like managing their self-care, home environment, daily tasks, and medication. As clients master these therapeutic activities, they become more confident and eager to remain active in school, work, and social environments. </p><p>Common occupational therapy interventions for mental health disorders include: </p><ul> <li>Art therapy</li> <li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</li> <li>Conditioning</li> <li>Expressive activities</li> <li>Functional living skills</li> <li>Group therapy </li> <li>Modeling</li> <li>Social skills training</li> <li>Structural tasks</li> <li>Systematic desensitization</li> <li>Vocational training</li> </ul><p>Mental health can be a barrier to self-care. The more clients stop caring for themselves, the worse they may feel. It can become an unhealthy cycle that’s hard to break. Occupational therapy works on grooming, bathing, eating, and dressing to help clients feel better about themselves and their world.</p><h3>Coping Strategies</h3><p>For clients with chronic or permanent cognitive or physical limitations, coping strategies are essential to process and manage their experiences. Occupational therapists empower clients by teaching healthy techniques to handle stress and anxiety in different settings and continue functioning in the community.  </p><h3>Goals </h3><p>Setting goals gives clients something to focus on and work toward. As they accomplish milestones along the way, they develop a sense of mastery and motivation to keep working hard. These positive strides can lead to mental health improvements. Occupational therapy tailors care plans to each client, setting short- and long-term goals and realistic timelines for achieving them. </p><p>Occupational therapists support clients in developing habits that improve physical and mental health and well-being. They model and encourage positive thinking and behavior to help clients shift away from negative thought patterns that can stall progress. When clients face setbacks, occupational therapists encourage them to stay focused and keep moving forward.</p><h2>Career Focus: Mental Health Occupational Therapists</h2><p>While all occupational therapists have a positive impact on patients’ mental health in the ways we’ve mentioned, some actually specialize in treating clients in mental health settings. </p><p>Mental health occupational therapists complete advanced training in helping individuals with psychiatric conditions work and live independently. They provide various interventions to help clients participate in daily tasks, with the premise that these occupations are vital to mental and physical health. </p><p>Some of these interventions and services mental health occupational therapists provide include: </p><ul> <li><b>Skills training</b>, including life skills, therapeutic cooking and leisure, job readiness, and other practical activities to build confidence and independence</li> <li><b>Calling and grounding strategies</b> to process information and remain calm and safe in real-world settings</li> <li><b>Self-care techniques</b> to make daily habits more manageable, allowing clients to participate in everyday activities</li> <li> <b>Discharge preparation assessment </b>to determine what clients need so they can be discharged from mental health settings safely </li> </ul><p>Mental health occupational therapists have a master’s degree from an accredited occupational therapy program and have passed the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) exam. They have also earned an accidental Board Certification in Mental Health from the American Occupational Therapy Association. </p><p>Are you ready for a new occupational therapy job?
