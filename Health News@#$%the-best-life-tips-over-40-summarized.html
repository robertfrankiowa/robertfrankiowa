The right changes made my skin clear up, my digestion improve, my confidence skyrocket, my hormones heal, and my anxiety decrease. After <em>a lot </em>of trial and error throughout my life, these ten changes have easily made the greatest impact on my body (and mind). </p><p>The best part: They’re realistic enough to keep up with consistently.  </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Stop labeling foods as “good” or “bad”</h2><p>Everything we eat has been predefined by our culture. “Sugar is <em>bad </em>for you,” “Whole30 is <em>good </em>for you,” or “I was so <em>bad</em> last week when I was on vacation” are all phrases you’ve probably heard or said too many times to count. Putting a moral value on food choices may not seem like a big deal. In fact, maybe you feel like it’s a helpful way to narrow down options. However, when we put black and white labels on food, what’s meant to nourish us becomes associated with guilt. Plus, the “want-what-we-can’t-have” mentality is not just true for bad boys; it’s true for food too, leading to cravings, binges, and serious regret. </p><p>I have so many thoughts on labeled eating, but for the sake of not going on and on (because I can), I’ll say this: Food is meant to be nourishing, satisfying, and pleasurable. I was over food plaguing my joy and eating meals that were more triggering than intuitive. Getting rid of labels helped me listen to what my body needed to eat, not what I should or shouldn’t eat. And guess what? I started craving fresh vegetables and whole grains, stopped bingeing on late-night snacks, and was able to feel satisfied after a cookie or one slice of pizza (instead of bingeing the whole sleeve or box) because I listened to my body’s cues. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Work out less</h2><p>Yes, you read that right. Working out <em>less </em>transformed my body for the better. When I went away to college, I attended regular workout classes snd I felt like I had to work out regularly, and if I could not make it to an hour-long class one day, I wouldn’t exercise at all, since anything else felt pointless.</p><p>When the pandemic happened and my precious gyms and yoga studios closed, I had limited motivation and a lot of anxiety. As a fix, I got more into restorative yoga and pilates and would go through flows for 15, 20, or 30 minutes instead of my usual hour-long classes. My new form of movement did not involve weights, fancy machines, or heart-rate monitors. Instead, I went on more walks, focused on deep breathing (instead of exasperating myself with intense cardio), and started to think every movement made a difference (rather than thinking it has to be an hour-long to be worth it).</p><p>The difference? I’m stronger than I have ever been because I’m prioritizing consistency over length or even quality, and I’m more intuitive about what my body needs. Now, I prioritize living less sedentarily and moving in ways that bring me joy. My motivation is to boost my mood instead of burning calories. My body became stronger and more energized when I stopped exercising to look a certain way or as “punishment”. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Realize that there is no “secret”</h2><p>Every season brings a new “weight loss pill,” “magic supplement,” or “miracle diet” that promises to be the cure-all to health woes and weight management. If you feel overwhelmed by what you should and shouldn’t try in the wellness space, that’s not by accident. In order to sell you limitless products and programs, you have to feel like your health is not in your control (spoiler: it is). I’ve tried popular diets, regularly tested new supplements, and have always been into trying the latest workout trend, but what I was missing was the big picture. </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"> <p>The truth is that one diet, supplement, or change won’t transform your body, mind, or life. Instead, it’s a bunch of little habits that build up into greater changes. Also, the body is not a one-size-fits-all pair of socks. What works for one person may not work for you, and vice versa. The only “secret” applicable to everybody is to listen to <em>your </em>body when it’s telling you something. </p> </blockquote><h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Add food instead of subtracting</h2><p>The problem with any diet is that it’s focused on what <em>not</em> to eat, which reinstates the labels of “good” and “bad.” One of the greatest changes that made the most difference in my eating habits is learning about food. When I knew about the nutrients and benefits that come from whole foods and plants (rather than just knowing they were “good”), I started seeing food as medicine and fuel, rather than just seeing it as a reward (like when I had an intense craving for mac ‘n’ cheese) or an enemy. </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"> <p>Focusing on eating <em>more </em>plants and whole foods has not only helped me feel my best and crave fruits and vegetables, but it has also subconsciously crowded out processed and sugary foods (totally guilt-free!). </p> </blockquote><h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Eat fruit for breakfast (or whatever your body craves)</h2><p>When I started thinking about how to add more produce, I tried eating more fruit in the mornings. After a while, I realized eating fruit surprisingly filled me up without making me lethargic or painfully bloated like I usually felt by noon.</p><p>So I let go of the idea that I needed a protein-heavy breakfast and instead listened to what my body craved: fruit. Some days, I dress up berries and pears with nut butter, coconut shreds, and goji berries like the pillar of health that I strive to be, and other days, I’ll cut up whatever fruits are in my fridge. I’ve never felt so energized, had fewer digestive issues, and even have fewer cravings throughout the day. </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"> <p>The lesson here is <em>not </em>that you should eat fruit for breakfast too–maybe your body does feel best with an omelet or avocado toast. Instead, the lesson is to listen to your body instead of outside opinions. </p> </blockquote><h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Find your real motivation</h2><p>After reading this, you might be thinking that this article is just a body-positive message, and maybe even a commentary on diet culture, but it’s not a concrete list of ways to reach your body and health goals. </p><p>I tell my clients that if they’re struggling to keep up with healthy habits, the problem is not their willpower but their motivation. The truth is that looking a certain way will <em>never </em>be motivating enough. No matter how badly we think we want to look like a fitspo post on Instagram, our deepest, truest selves know that happiness does not depend on how we look externally. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. (Actually) stay hydrated</h2><p>Drinking more water is a tale as old as time, but there’s a reason just about every expert on the planet recommends it. Drinking a big glass of water first thing when waking up, sipping on a reusable straw throughout the day (I’m partial to these pretty gold ones), and having three drinks at a time to achieve optimal hydration (like lemon water and green juice with my coffee), has made a drastic difference in how my body feels. If I start getting hungry too soon after eating, rather than going straight to the pantry to mindlessly snack, I drink a big glass of water. Of course, if I’m still hungry afterward, I’ll eat something nourishing (the body knows what it needs), but more often than not, I’ve realized that a lot of hunger cues are actually just from thirst. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Prioritize sleep first</h2><p>YI often abided by the “I’ll sleep when I’m dead” mentality, which often meant staying out late while still fitting in a workout when I could, which usually meant the crack of dawn. It’s not that going to an early morning workout class is bad (it’s not!). But I chose working out over getting enough sleep, thinking it was the better option for me. These days, if I have to choose between a workout and getting 7-8 hours of sleep, you know what I choose? Sleep. Every time. </p><p>I now think of sleep as medicine: When we sleep, the body is able to repair, detox, and help heal itself. </p><p>As much as I can help it, I protect my time and energy to ensure my body is getting good, quality sleep every night, which means putting a wind-down routine over bingeing another episode on Netflix, or letting myself sleep in after Wine Wednesday instead of fitting in a workout on a busy Thursday. Now, sleep comes first, and my body has never felt (or looked) better.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Use your hormones as your roadmap</h2><p>Since my first period at 12 years old, I’ve been at war with my reproductive cycle. I had such bad cramps, nausea, and heavy flow that my gynecologist put me on the birth control pill when I was 15. Over 10 years of birth control pills later, I started to intuitively feel that being on the pill that long was not benefitting me as I went through my healing journey, especially when I started to think about fertility. I had educated myself on the reproductive cycleand saw the power of tapping into my natural hormones. Plus, it gives you important insight into what’s going on in your body. I desperately wanted that feedback and connection to my body I hadn’t had for over a decade. (Much more on this if you search “menopause” on my blog)</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Rethink what health means to you</h2><p>Now for the biggest truth bomb of all: If you’re struggling to reach your health goals, perhaps the problem is not what you are or are not doing, but what your health goals are to begin with. On social media, we’re bombarded with hashtags like #fitspo and #dreambod, and often build health goals around a certain pants size or number on a scale. </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"> <p>But those extra 5, 10, 15, or 20 pounds are where <em>life happens</em>. That’s the extra glass of wine with your best friend, the ice cream cone at the beach in the middle of summer, and your favorite chocolate cake from the bakery down the road that tastes like the one your mom used to make. Why are we so focused on shrinking these moments, demoting them to be worth nothing more than a pants size l?</p> </blockquote><p>Instead, I’m letting my body <em>exist </em>in the healthy space it wants to be in. My “ideal weight” or “ideal body” is the one that yes, I feel most strong, energized, and healthy in but also is the one that allows me extra indulgences, fun moments, and enjoyment. No matter how you eat, work out, or meditate, you will never “achieve” health and be done with your wellness journey because health is not a destination or an end goal. It’s a never-ending practice and a tool we can use to help us live our happiest lives. Otherwise, what’s the point?</p></main>
