    <main><h1>15 Habits of ‘Biologically Younger’ People Who Defy Their Real Age</h1><p>Many struggle to maintain a timeless appearance in a world obsessed with youthfulness.</p><p>Certain habits can make us “biologically younger,” while other “harmless habits” can age us despite our efforts to do the right thing. So, how do we defy our real age as we grow older?</p><p>Here are 15 habits guaranteed to help you slow the clock as you age.</p><figure><img title="15 Habits of ‘Biologically Younger’ People Who Defy Their Real Age" src="IMG/BB1oSuOE_15_habits_of_biologically_younger_people_who_defy_their_real_age.jpg" alt="15 Habits of ‘Biologically Younger’ People Who Defy Their Real Age"><figcaption><em>15 Habits of ‘Biologically Younger’ People Who Defy Their Real Age.

Instead of getting preoccupied by a number, why not treat it like what it is?</p><p>After all, age is just a number. If you think you’re young, you feel young — and it shows. Besides, you’ll feel happier and more content when you accept things you can’t change.</p><figure><img title="Accept Your Age" src="IMG/BB1oSgYI_accept_your_age.jpg" alt="Accept Your Age"><figcaption><em>Accept Your Age.

While genetics play an important role in how our skin ages, we can also fight back against the ravages of time.</p><p>Exposure to sunshine in the morning to get vitamin D is ideal, but you should wear protective clothes if you venture outside in the heat of the day. Also, try skincare products with vitamin C to keep your skin toned and soft.</p><h2>Protect Your Nails and Hair</h2><p>Having unkempt, brittle, and lifeless hair can age us. We need a good regimen, regular haircuts, and trims to keep our hair shiny and full of life.</p><p>Likewise, brittle nails correlate with looking older than your age. Using a good hand and cuticle cream can keep your nails looking healthy and prevent chipping. However, nutrition is an important part of having strong hair and nails, leading to our next point.</p><h2>Avoid Ultra-Processed Foods</h2><p>Young-looking people pay attention to their nutrition and avoid ultra-processed foods, which contain a long list of ingredients and additives that make them taste like “real” food without the nutritional benefits.</p><p>Instead of hot dogs and cereal, which are full of sugar and unhealthy fats, consume fresh vegetables, meat, nuts, and from-scratch meals to give your skin, hair, nails, and body the nutrition they crave and stay healthy and youthful.</p><h2>Don’t Eat High-Carb Diets</h2><p>Any diet that includes sugary food and drinks and high-carb, nutritionally low food like chips and white bread is conducive to weight gain and a host of health issues that make us look old, in addition to increasing our risk for illness.</p><p>Also, avoid vegetable oils and stick to olive and coconut oil to give your body optimal healthy fats. Low-carb diets can help you keep a youthful figure and lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p><h2>Eliminate Sugar</h2><p>If we keep the same sweet tooth we were able to get away with when we were in college, sugar will turn on us and make us overweight. It will also make our skin look dull and promote wrinkle formation. </p><p>While sugar is addictive, you can eliminate it from your diet if you avoid ultra-processed foods and limit the amount of candy and dessert you consume daily. Your health and waistline will thank you!</p><h2>Drink Alcohol in Moderation</h2><p>Alcohol is no friend to looking young. It dehydrates you, making your skin look dry and wrinkles more prominent. Worse, alcohol also slows your brain, which is the opposite of what you need when you’re trying to maintain a healthy, positive outlook.</p><p>While you can still drink in moderation, you’re better off eliminating alcohol from your life to avoid these pitfalls and strengthen your immune system.</p><h2>Don’t Smoke</h2><p>If you’ve smoked for any length of time, you know that cigarettes can make your lips develop fine lines, which automatically make you look older. Worse, nicotine reduces oxygen flow to your skin, making it look wrinkled and dry.</p><p>To become a “biologically younger” person, ditch tobacco now and enjoy fewer dental and gum problems in addition to looking younger.</p><h2>Stay Active</h2><p>Staying active is a no-brainer. Sedentarism can make us overweight and cause health issues like varicose veins, aches, and pains that make us the opposite of youthful.</p><p>While you don’t need to walk a marathon every day, you should go for a walk daily and spend as much time on the move as possible to feel and stay young. Yoga and cardio are also good ways to exercise your body.</p><h2>Engage Your Brain</h2><p>Your body’s on the move, but what about your brain? This organ is all-powerful in convincing ourselves and our bodies that we’re fit, young, and well.</p><p>To exercise your brain, prevent memory issues, and improve focus, you can learn new hobbies and skills and use hacks to improve your brain health and memory. When your brain is active, you are less likely to be anxious or depressed. Instead, you feel happy and fulfilled, which is crucial to healthy longevity.</p><h2>Be Social</h2><p>Research shows that social isolation and loneliness negatively impact people’s longevity, quality of life, and mental health. Socializing with loved ones improves your mood and lowers your risk of brain degeneration and dementia.</p><p>People who look younger than their age often feel happier and more engaged when they participate in social activities. In turn, their involvement helps their minds remain agile and vibrant, which is one of their secret weapons against aging.</p><figure><img title="Be Social" src="IMG/AA1nVlRB_be_social.jpg" alt="Be Social"><figcaption><em>Be Social.

That said, completely getting rid of stress is impossible.</p><p>You can keep your stress levels low and approach life from a mindful spot where you only worry about things you can control and don’t cling to problems that aren’t yours to solve. As you manage your mental health, your emotions will also become easier to control.</p><h2>Don’t Skip Sleep</h2><p>Without quality rest, our bodies can’t maintain healthy skin or prevent premature aging. Lack of sleep also affects our appetite, increasing our hunger and making us reach for unhealthy snacks.</p><p>People who look younger understand the vital role sleep plays in stress reduction and a healthy brain and prioritize getting at least seven hours of uninterrupted slumber each night.</p><h2>Be Grateful</h2><p>Peace of mind works wonders to make us look and feel younger. Without it, we spiral into a negative mix of stress, worry, and anxiety that shows in our faces and posture, making us look older than our age.</p><p>A simple way to achieve peace of mind is to be grateful for what you have and where you are, including your age.</p><h2>Practice Mindfulness</h2><p>Mindfulness lets you become aware of your feelings, thoughts, and how your body feels. People who look younger than they are often practice mindfulness to avoid clinging to the past and overthinking the present.</p><p>With this helpful tool, they maintain their youthful spirits, enjoy better moods and energy levels, and improve health outcomes.</p></main>
