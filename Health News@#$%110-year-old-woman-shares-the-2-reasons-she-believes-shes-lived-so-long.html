    <main><h1>110-year-old woman shares the 2 reasons she believes she's lived so long</h1><p>While Ruth Onley could have never known she’d live to 110, there were hints: Her father lived until he was nearly 105, and Onley says her relationship with God definitely has something to do with it. “(God) told me my days were all numbered. But he didn’t tell me the number,” Onley laughs.</p><p>Onley, one of 10 children, was born in 1914 in Weverton, Maryland. She was educated in a one-room school until the third grade before she focused her attention on helping look after her siblings.</p><p>When she was 16, she began working for prominent families in Frederick, Maryland. Until she was 26, she looked after their homes and helped raise their children. She stopped once she married Robert Onley. Together, the couple had five children. Since then, her family has only grown, resulting in 15 grandchildren, 50 great grandchildren, 25 great-great grandchildren, and two great-great-great grandchildren.</p><p>Onley attributes her lasting health to them. “It’s the way my children take care of me,” Onley tells TODAY.com. Here are some of her other secrets for living a long life and enjoying it.</p><figure><img title="Courtesy Dawn Onley" src="IMG/BB1pRvMd_ruth_onley_courtesy_dawn_onley.jpg" alt="Ruth Onley.

Onley prepared a soul food buffet every Sunday after church for her family and neighbors. She’d make chicken salad sandwiches, roast chicken, ham, candied sweet potatoes, greens, macaroni and cheese, cabbage, fried chicken, peach cobbler and pound cake.</p><p>Onley’s also a skilled canner. Her granddaughter, Dawn Onley, says she regularly made applesauce, string beans, corn, tomatoes, jam, jelly, pickles and pickled relish.</p><h2><strong>Make every day with your partner count</strong></h2><p>Onley met her husband through her cousin. She’d known of Robert Onley for a number of years before settling down with him. They went on to have Mary, Robert, John and Jane — their fifth child passed away.</p><p>Robert Onley died in 1962, when Onley was 48. And though she was a young widow, Onley never considered remarrying. “I only married once,” Onley says. “Once your husband dies, the Lord becomes your husband.”</p><h2><strong>Never stop having fun</strong></h2><p>Throughout her 110 years, Onley’s competitive spirit has only grown. Onley’s big on games and isn’t shy about beating her grandchildren at card games, Scrabble, word searches and Connect 4.</p><p>She also spends her days crocheting and watching game shows on TV.</p><figure><img title="Courtesy Dawn Onley" src="IMG/BB1pREXE_ruth_onley_courtesy_dawn_onley.jpg" alt="Ruth Onley.

Lunch and dinner typically include meat and vegetables. As for beverages, Onley is a fan of plain, warm water.</p><p>Onley’s desserts, on the other hand, are less regimented. She’s a fan of root beer floats, banana splits and ice cream.</p><h2><strong>Let God and family be your light</strong></h2><p>Without a doubt, Onley’s faith and family have sustained her throughout her life. In addition to caregivers the family’s hired, Onley’s children spend multiple nights with their mother each month to look after her, just has Onley did with her father.</p><figure><img title="Courtesy Dawn Onley" src="IMG/BB1pRDg1_ruth_onley_and_family_courtesy_dawn_onley.jpg" alt="Ruth Onley and family.

Quoting John Newton’s “Amazing grace,” Onley says, "Through many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come. The lord hath brought me safe thus far, and the Lord will lead me home."</p></main>
