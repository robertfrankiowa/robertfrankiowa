    <main><h1>I Lost 100 Pounds Eating These Delicious Foods</h1><p>As a person who lost a hundred pounds and kept it off, I know the weight loss struggle all too well. Now, as a Registered Dietitian with a Master's degree in Nutrition and Dietetics, my ideas have worked for literally thousands of people through my work as a nutritionist and best-selling author of <em>You Can Drop It!</em>, the book based on my successful 2B Mindset program. Now, I've encapsulated those principles into my recent cookbook, <em>Love The Food That Loves You Back</em>, featuring 100 recipes that serve up big portions and super nutritious food. Here's a sneak peek about how the foods can work for you—and a mouth-watering dessert-for-breakfast recipe at the end.</p><figure><img title="I Lost 100 Pounds Eating These Delicious Foods" src="IMG/BB1noe2T_i_lost_100_pounds_eating_these_delicious_foods.jpg" alt="I Lost 100 Pounds Eating These Delicious Foods"><figcaption><em>I Lost 100 Pounds Eating These Delicious Foods. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 My Struggle With Weight</h2><p>It started at a young age, with summers spent at weight loss camps and school years marked by yo-yo dieting. This cycle continued for years, leading me to a point where I was 215 pounds at just five feet two inches tall. The constant battle with weight took a toll not only on my body but also on my self-esteem. However, it was this very struggle that ignited my passion for nutrition and set me on a path to discover a sustainable way to lose weight.</p><h2>2 The Real Success Is Keeping the Weight Off</h2><p>Losing 100 pounds was just the start of my journey. The real success has been in maintaining that weight loss and helping others do the same. Through my cookbook and the 2B Mindset program, I want to share the joy of eating well and living healthily. I believe that everyone deserves to love the food they eat and to love the way they feel. So here's what to eat to lose the weight and keep it off.</p><h2>3 Step 1: Eat "Veggies Most"</h2><p><em>Love The Food That Loves You Back</em> is filled with recipes that are not just healthy but delicious and satisfying. They reflect my journey and philosophy: you don't have to give up great taste to lose weight. In fact, I believe in eating high-volume, low-calorie foods that allow you to enjoy hearty portions without the guilt. For example, let's star with vegetables—I always say, fill your plate with "Veggies Most." Packed with fiber, they help make you feel full, and that's partly what helps with greater results in weight loss. A 12-month randomized controlled trial published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that eating more vegetables led to greater hunger satisfaction, meaning it made people feel less hungry (weight loss was related to the amount of calories coming from vegetables). So the more vegetables people were consuming, the greater weight loss results they were seeing. Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that advising people to eat big volumes of low calorie foods like veggies and soups was a more successful weight-loss strategy than advising people to restrict their portions and focus on eating less.</p><figure><img title="3 Step 1: Eat " veggies="" most""="" src="IMG/AA1nIulr_3_step_1_eat_veggies_most.jpg" alt="3 Step 1: Eat " veggies="" most""=""><figcaption><em>3 Step 1: Eat "Veggies Most". © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Veggies are Your New Comfort Foods, if Cooked That Way</h2><p>The words "comfort food" (in conversation or in hashtags) usually conjure up the same images—nana's lasagna, a pint of ice cream, or some other heavy dish. They're called that because, in the moment, they make you feel better as they load your belly and satisfy cravings of salt, sugar, or size. The only problem with too many of those comfort foods is that they're often the source of discomfort—sometimes because of how you feel after eating it and sometimes because they can be part of what contributes to your weight gain and poor health. I think it's time we redefined what "comfort" means. Comfort foods should make you feel satisfied.  Comfort foods shouldn't make you feel guilty. Comfort foods should do your body more good than harm. Comfort foods should make you happy. Vegetables—when you know how to make them in exciting ways—hit all of those checkmarks.</p><figure><img title="4 Veggies are Your New Comfort Foods, if Cooked That Way" src="IMG/BB1jz6yS_4_veggies_are_your_new_comfort_foods_if_cooked_that_way.jpg" alt="4 Veggies are Your New Comfort Foods, if Cooked That Way"><figcaption><em>4 Veggies are Your New Comfort Foods, if Cooked That Way. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Find Your Favorites</h2><p>Green, white, red, yellow, orange. Leafy, crunchy, squishy. Veggies come in all shapes, sizes, flavors and textures—and there's one (or many) for you. As you're working on "Veggies Most"," find the few that you really like and make them a staple. It can be broccoli, cauliflower, squash, or peppers. Whatever your veggie lovin' (or soon-to-be veggie lovin') heart desires. I just want you to have a few that you love. That way, you always know you have something on hand to fill your plate. And remember, these can come in all forms—raw, frozen, canned, grilled, flavored with any hundreds of spices or accessories. Just as long as you have your go-to veggies, you'll never have to guess, scramble, or go without.</p><h2>6 Step 2: Protein. Have it at Every Meal.</h2><p>While some people have a good idea about what protein is (yes, it's found primarily in meat, but it's also in other foods, like fish, eggs, beans, grains, and other veggies), not everybody understands its role. Some people associate protein with muscle-building—i.e. if you have a lot of protein, your muscles are going to bulk up to the size of small cars. Protein is a building block for muscles, but it's not true that eating protein will muscle you up to sizes you don't want.In fact, the opposite is true: Protein can help slim you down, while maintaining a lean physique. In your body, protein gets broken down into amino acids, which are indeed important building blocks for cells in your body. The main reason why I like them is that they go a long way in helping you feel satiated—which certainly is one of the key components to curbing hunger throughout the day. So if you make sure to get enough protein—then you can really fend off hunger pangs and cravings—enemy No. 1 for people who want to lose weight. </p><figure><img title="6 Step 2: Protein.

Have it at Every Meal.. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Start the Day With Protein</h2><h2>8 Mix Up Your Protein Sources</h2><p>Part of the reason why I love protein sources is that they pair beautifully with your plant-based power. Think about all the options you have—veggie omelets, chicken fajitas, salmon salads, Asian stir fry, so many. I also love sneaking  veggies in a smoothie, like mixing chocolate protein powder with spinach, nut butter, and almond milk for a delicious (and easy to make on-the-go) meal. The point is that there are so many different ways to consume protein that you don't have to feel limited by just a few options. </p><h2>9 These Meals Were the Cornerstone of My Weight Loss Journey</h2><p>In the cookbook, I'm thrilled to share with you the very meals that have been a cornerstone of my weight loss journey. It kicks off with breakfast – it's not just the first meal of the day; it's a celebration of a fresh start. I've packed in recipes like Chocolate Cream Rolls, Protein Oats, and a game-changing Tempeh BLT. Or try Seasonal Breakfast Boats, featuring the exotic tastes of papaya and sweet potato. Make them a morning ritual that'll have you feeling full, reducing those 11 am cravings.</p><p>And veggies become your new best friends. I'm talking about dishes like Thai Peanut Hearts of Palm Spaghetti and Eggplant Sesame Noodles – meals that'll make you rethink everything you thought you knew about plant-based eating. And for my fellow crunch enthusiasts, the Roasted Wonders section is a treasure trove. You'll make Eggplant Parm Fries and Air Fried Mini Bell Peppers. This isn't just about eating well; it's about loving every bite along your journey to health and happiness.</p><h2>10 Here's One of My Favorite Recipes From the Book</h2><p>CHOCOLATE CREAM ROLLS</p><p>Who wouldn't want "cake" for breakfast???</p><p>Serves 2</p><p>Ingredients</p><p>2 bananas</p><p>4 eggs</p><p>1 tsp. vanilla extract</p><p>1½ cups plain Greek yogurt (nonfat or 2 percent) or dairy-free "Greek style" yogurt</p><p>1 tbsp. cocoa powder</p><p>Pinch of salt</p><p>1 tbsp. honey, maple syrup, or monk fruit (or use stevia drops to taste)</p><p>Directions<ol><li>Preheat oven to 350 F.
