    <main><h1>Why You Need to Visit This Luxury Wellness Resort That Sits Atop a Crystal Mountain</h1><p><p>The sun is shining brightly through the surrounding trees as my driver navigates the winding roads leading to the boutique wellness resort I’m about to call home for the next five days thanks to a press trip. A luxury escape nestled in a quartz mountain (which is said to have healing properties—but the science on that is iffy), The Retreat Costa Rica is a necessary reminder to take care of yourself—complete with an array of services and packages to help you do it well. </p><p>Health and wellness life coach Diana Stobo opened The Retreat Costa Rica in 2016 to fulfill her dream of creating a place where people could come to heal and feel their best. With just 18 rooms, the intimate resort features lush greenery, stunning views, and a calming energy I could feel the moment I stepped foot on the property. Not to mention the unparalleled spa, one-of-a-kind dining, and exceptional service. Imagine a place so tranquil and beautiful, every detail purposeful and pointed. </p><h2 class="body-h2">The accommodation</h2><p>There are three types of rooms on the property, and I was lucky enough to stay in Papaya—one of the “luxury lofts”—a generous suite with sprawling mountain views, a large outdoor balcony, a plush king-sized bed, and a beautiful open floorplan. There is a soaking tub adjacent to the floor-to-ceiling window, which I would sit in nearly every night to relax and take in the stunning scenery. Also wonderful was the waterfall shower (complete with high-quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash—trust me, I’m picky about my personal care products). Other nice touches included an aromatherapy diffuser, cotton bathrobe and slippers, and tranquil decor.</p><p><p>The rest of the resort is as gorgeous and relaxing as the rooms. There are two pools—the main pool near the lobby and restaurant, and a second one at the spa (more on that later.) Each pool has beautiful views, comfortable lounge chairs, and a hot tub. Next to the main pool, restaurant, and lobby is a reading room (complete with games, comfortable seating, and a library of books) and a self-service coffee and tea area. Plus, since the resort is so intimate nothing is more than a five-minute walk away. </p><h2 class="body-h2">The activities</h2><p>My favorite activity at The Retreat was the yoga classes offered twice a day. I began each morning at 8 a.m. with an energizing flow to help awaken my mind and body and returned to the yoga studio at 4 p.m. for restorative practice and meditation. Cynthia, the residential yoga instructor, was wonderful. She even gave me a few pointers that improved my postures and poses, which I will take with me on my yoga journey.</p><p>The Retreat also offers events like wellness cooking classes, mocktail classes, tea tastings, and sound healing. Since I loved the mocktails o much, I made sure to attend that class. The bartender, Jonathan, began by taking us to the garden to pick some fresh herbs he’d be using during the class. Then we sat at the bar and watched him make two fabulous drinks (and sipped plenty while we watched). I’ll admit I was a bit skeptical of the bell pepper sour he made using red bell pepper, lime, orange, basil, and agave, but it turned out so delicious. He also walked us through how to make a mango mule, with mango, lime, orange, basil, vanilla-infused agave, coconut oil, and ginger beer.</p><p><p>While there are several exciting tours and excursions (like a visit to La Fortuna and the Arenal Volcano, a surfing adventure in Jaco, a coffee farm tour, and more), I decided to stay on the grounds during my trip and opt for a more relaxing, restorative vacation. I did, however, embark on a nature hike that departed from the property and featured several trails winding through the crystal mountain. The hike ended up being a little too intense for me (disclaimer: I am <em>not</em> someone who hikes regularly) so I decided to turn back after about 15 minutes. But this could be a great activity for those more active and adventurous than I am. </p><h2 class="body-h2">The food</h2><p>Perhaps the highlight of my trip, the food served at Sol Terrace (the on-site restaurant), was one-of-a-kind. It has what The Retreat describes as an “inclusive chef’s choice menu,” meaning that <em>there is no menu</em>—each meal is determined by the chef, using fresh and organic ingredients. All menu items are anti-inflammatory, plant-based, mostly grain-, dairy-, and refined-sugar-free. </p><p>I’ll admit: This had me nervous. I am by no means the healthiest or most adventurous eater, and I was unsure if I would enjoy the food. Luckily, I couldn’t have been more wrong. Every meal was more delicious than the next, and I left with so many ideas about new dishes to make and foods I knew I wanted to eat more of at home. </p><p>Each breakfast came with a first course of fresh fruit, fresh juice, chia or oat puddings, and granola. The second course included some variation of an egg dish a grain-free muffin. The only time I had an issue was when the egg dish was a poached egg—I am super picky about how I like my eggs. But after telling my waiter, they were happy to make them scrambled instead—which were delicious. </p><p><p>Lunch is always vegetarian with delicious salads for the first course and innovative veggie-based dishes for the second. My favorite one consisted of a salad with balsamic dressing, strawberries, and cucumber followed by baked quinoa balls topped with goat cheese and cherry tomatoes on a bed of spinach and hummus. Bonus: Lunch is always served with a delicious mocktail—my favorite was the ginger and pineapple. </p><p><p>The three-course dinner was my favorite of all the meals. Each started with a soup (the carmelized onion and turmeric were incredible); then a main dish with your choice of protein (including vegan options); and a delicious dessert (the dark chocolate-covered cashew ice cream topped with vegan caramel sauce was a highlight).</p><p><h2 class="body-h2">The spa, treatments, and wellness packages </h2><p>Devoted to nurturing the mind, body, and spirit, the Vida Mía Healing Center and Spa is central to the experience. The menu of massages, beautifying facials, ayurvedic practices, and energy-balancing rituals are all designed to promote everyday healing.</p><p>I spent <em>a lot</em> of time here. Even when I wasn’t being pampered with spa treatments, this was one of my favorite areas to relax and spend downtime. The spa is split into two levels, each with vast views of the surrounding mountains and greenery. The first is home to the gym, jacuzzi, sauna, cold-water cascade, and locker room. The second holds a stunning pool, lounge chairs, and a meditation deck (plus the entrance to the nature hike). </p><p>While The Retreat offers a few different wellness packages, I decided to pick and choose specific treatments from their spa menu that appealed to me. For those focusing on fitness and weight loss, consider following the Naked Challenge or Fitness Reboot. A program based on stress reduction and detoxification of the body and mind, the Emotional Healing and Recovery program includes treatments and experiences for mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Mastering Menopause is another offering, focusing on self-empowerment, hormonal health, and physical fitness. You also have the option to speak with the staff about your personal wellness goals to craft a program perfect for you. </p><figure><img title="The Retreat Costa Rica" src="IMG/BB1nLnxA_vidamiaentrancejpeg.jpg" alt="VidaMia_Entrance.jpeg"><figcaption><em>Vida Mia Spa entrance .

This 40-minute indulgence combines deep massage with seven adjustable shower heads flowing onto the skin and was truly the most relaxing experience. The hydrotherapy treatment claims to promote circulation, muscle relaxation, and nervous system relief. </p><p>I also had the opportunity to experience a personalized Ayurvedic treatment that left me feeling revitalized and rejuvenated. After speaking with an Ayurvedic expert, trained in India, I received a 90-minute treatment that started with a head and shoulder massage, followed by a full body massage and body scrub. </p><h2 class="body-h2">The bottom line</h2><p>If a relaxing and intimate wellness vacation is what you’re after, I highly recommend considering a trip to The Retreat Costa Rica. While it may be a bit of an investment, I feel it’s well worth it. Every detail here is so perfectly executed to rejuvenate the mind and body well beyond your vacation.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
