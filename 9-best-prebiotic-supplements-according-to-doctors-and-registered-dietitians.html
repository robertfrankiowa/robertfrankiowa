    <main><h1>9 Best Prebiotic Supplements, According to Doctors and Registered Dietitians</h1><h2>Omni Biotic AB 10 Microbiome Restoration Probiotic</h2><p>Glassman is a fan of combo products like this one that include probiotics and prebiotics in one dose, which can simplify your routine. Omni Biotic adheres to stringent quality and manufacturing guidelines, and performs third-party testing, which can give you some peace of mind regarding the safety and efficacy of the ingredients. Glassman also points out Omni Biotic’s unique delivery mechanism, which may help get more of the probiotics in the product to your large intestine where they’re needed. This vegan supplement is a powder (portioned and packaged as daily, individual servings) containing freeze-dried probiotic bacteria and prebiotic fiber. According to the company, when you dissolve the mix in water, the microbes rehydrate and eat the prebiotic nutrients, fortifying them to successfully pass through the acidic environment of the stomach and small intestine. Research has shown this product to be effective in reducing diarrhea caused by antibiotics, and to be beneficial in the treatment of C. Diff, a bacterial infection in the intestines.</p><p><strong>Doses per box:</strong> 30<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Non-GMO corn starch, inulin, rice protein, FOS<br> <strong>Key</strong> <strong>strains of probiotics</strong>: Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Lactobacillus paracasei W20, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37<br> <strong>CFU count:</strong> 5 billion</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> This powder contains 10 different strains of probiotics, as well as various forms of prebiotic fiber, and variety is key to a healthy gut, says Lemein. Its delivery method may mean that more of the bacteria actually survive the stomach to get to your lower digestive tract. The tasty vanilla flavor is another bonus.</p><h2>Mindbodygreen Organic Fiber Potency+</h2><p>This fiber supplement gets a seal of approval from Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, for its three types of prebiotic fiber, including guar fiber, green kiwifruit, and an organic mushroom trio. It’s low in FODMAPs (or fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols)—these are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and ferment in the colon, which often cause problems for people with digestive issues like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), says Ajmera. In addition to prebiotics, this vegan powder contains a probiotic strain that can promote regularity—another positive for the IBS girlies.</p><p><strong>Doses per bag:</strong> 20<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Guar fiber, New Zealand green kiwifruit powder, reishi mushroom, maitake mushroom, oyster mushroom<br> <strong>Key strain of probiotic:</strong> Bacillus subtilis<br> <strong>CFU count:</strong> 5 billion</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> “Beyond boosting gut health, it’s also a great choice for supporting satiety and appetite control, thanks to the inclusion of guar fiber,” Ajmera says. “It’s also certified organic and third-party tested, so you can be sure you’re actually getting what’s listed on the label.” Reviewers say it’s virtually tasteless, or describe it as having a very subtle oat-like taste, which makes it easy to mix into water, coffee, and other drinks.</p><figure><img title="Mindbodygreen Organic Fiber Potency+" src="IMG/BB1oOKXf_mindbodygreen_organic_fiber_potency.jpg" alt="Mindbodygreen Organic Fiber Potency+"><figcaption><em>Mindbodygreen Organic Fiber Potency+. Courtesy of brand</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Organic Fiber</h2><p>Featuring 5 grams of prebiotic fiber per serving from sources like acacia (a warm-climate shrub), orange peel, and baobab fruit, this powder supplement can ease constipation to help you stay regular, says Ajmera. Navya Mysore, MD, also recommends this Garden of Life fiber for constipation, noting that you should drink plenty of water when you’re taking added fiber to help it function in your body properly and reduce the likelihood that it’ll cause an upset stomach. Acacia fiber, research shows, may be particularly good for people who have IBS-C (irritable bowel syndrome with constipation).</p><p><strong>Doses per bag:</strong> 32<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Acacia fiber, orange peel, baobab fruit, apple peel, cranberry seed</p><p><strong>Key strain of probiotic:</strong> None</p><p><strong>CFU count:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> This powder is an affordable way to add prebiotic fiber to your diet, and you can pair it with a probiotic for even better gut health (Glassman recommends looking for ones with Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium lactis for constipation). Not only is it certified organic, but it’s also certified gluten-free and certified vegan, an ideal option for those with dietary restrictions. It comes in unflavored and citrus, so you have a couple of options when it comes to taste and mixing.</p><h2>Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic</h2><p>This is another doctor- and dietitian-loved combination pill, containing 24 different strains of probiotics, including Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, which is known for promoting heart health and good cholesterol, and Bifidobacterium breve, which shows promise for improving skin health, says Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN. “The outer capsule is actually the prebiotic! It’s made from Indian pomegranate whole fruit extract, which has antioxidant benefits, too,” Largeman-Roth says.</p><p>Seed also has a unique delivery mechanism that may help the probiotics survive their journey to your lower gastrointestinal tract. It’s a capsule within a capsule, which helps protect bacteria as it travels through stomach acid, and serves as a barrier to oxygen, moisture, and heat, so the pills don’t have to be refrigerated. Dr. Mysore says that Seed is a high-quality choice for anyone looking to maintain their gut microbiome during and after taking antibiotics, and for regularity during travel. It can also help with IBS and SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), she says. Largeman-Roth also appreciates that these pills come in a refillable jar.</p><p><strong>Doses per bottle:</strong> 30<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Indian pomegranate, rice fiber, rice extract blend <br> <strong>Key strains of probiotics:</strong> Bifidobacterium longum SD-BB536-JP, Bifidobacterium breve SD-BR3-IT, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SD-LP1-IT</p><p><strong>CFU count:</strong> Company uses a different unit of measurement, and contains 53.6 billion AFUs</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> Seed is expensive—and it has skyrocketed in popularity—but it may be worth the hype given the large number of probiotic strains and solid delivery method (and you can lower the cost a bit if you sign up for a subscription). The product is GMP compliant and free of common allergens, and various clinical trials back up the company’s claims. “I was totally influenced but it works great,” says Elle Choi, director of social and content marketing for Marriott International. She says it’s helped her stay “very regular,” and improved her morning breath, “which I knew was caused by stomach acids,” she says. Alexa M., a graphic designer, has also noticed more consistent BMs with Seed. “I started taking it after my therapist suggested I try some probiotics to help my stomach, which has been a bit wrecked due to anxiety, and now I keep taking it because it helps with regularity and makes me feel good,” she says. “I like the routine. I don’t think all the time, ‘oh my stomach is upset’ anymore.”</p><p><strong>What to note:</strong> Seed recommends you work up to taking two pills a day, but that may be a bit much for some people. Margaux Anbouba, senior beauty and wellness editor at <em>Vogue</em>, uses Seed to help manage gut issues associated with celiac disease. “I love it but it’s really powerful—I was never able to go up to two pills a day because I found it too intense,” she says. “It didn’t necessarily give me a stomach ache but I was more aware of my stomach than I wanted to be.”</p><h2>Thorne FiberMend</h2><p>Thorne’s FiberMend is a prebiotic powder with a solid serving of soluble fiber, which is great for promoting regularity, lowering cholesterol, and keeping blood sugar levels steady, says Ajmera. “Plus, it contains green tea phytosome, which includes some of the health-enhancing compounds found in green tea like EGCG, a type of antioxidant,” she says. Known for producing high-quality and effective supplements, Thorne is a reputable manufacturer that Ajmera highly recommends.</p><p><strong>Doses per bag:</strong> 30<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Partially hydrolyzed guar gum, rice bran, arabinogalactan, pectin</p><p><strong>Key strain of probiotic:</strong> None</p><p><strong>CFU count:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> Consuming soluble fibers, like those found in this powder, can help you feel full longer, because when they dissolve in water, they form a gel-like compound in the gastrointestinal tract which slows down digestion. Thorne specifically uses clinically-studied ingredients and all their products are free of additives and allergens like eggs, gluten, and nuts. This powder is pretty affordable, to boot.</p><h2>Life Extension Florassist Prebiotic Chewable</h2><p>These chewable, vegetarian tablets are a great option if you can’t stomach the idea of swallowing another big pill. “They include 1,000 mg of xylooligosaccharides, a type of prebiotic fiber that can stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, including bifidobacteria,” says Ajmera. Bifidobacteria are a major piece of the pie when it comes to healthy digestion and a strong, efficient immune system. Ajmera also points to the fact that Life Extension products are third-party tested to ensure quality, safety, and purity.</p><p><strong>Doses per bottle:</strong> 60<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Xylooligosaccharides</p><p><strong>Key strain of probiotic:</strong> None</p><p><strong>CFU count:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> These strawberry-flavored chewables offer a more pleasant way to get your prebiotics, since drinking a full glass of water with a powder or taking a capsule certainly isn’t for everyone.</p><h2>Nature’s Way Fortify Optima Advanced Care 90 Billion Probiotic + Prebiotic</h2><p>This capsule includes Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a strain of Lactobaccilli that’s shown to keep the vaginal microbiome happy and healthy, says Largeman-Roth. It also includes several strains for gut health and includes 75 mg of prebiotic fiber. Certain bacteria strains (like those in these once-a-day, delayed-release capsules) are more sensitive to heat and humidity, which means they need to be refrigerated to maintain their potency.</p><p><strong>Doses per bottle:</strong> 30<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Chicory root, gum acacia fiber, inulin, cellulose<br> <strong>Key strains of probiotics:</strong> Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG<br> <strong>CFU count:</strong> 90 billion</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> This supplement contains a wide range of probiotic strains and multiple forms of prebiotics—and variety is always a good sign. Largeman-Roth appreciates that it’s formulated specially for women’s health issues. The capsules are chocolate-flavored, which might make them a bit easier to take. Largeman-Roth hasn’t used this probiotic/prebiotic combo specifically, but has had good luck with other Nature’s Way products in the past.</p><h2>Ritual Synbiotic+</h2><p>This delayed-release capsule contains prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics (specially the short-chain fatty acid butyrate), which are the waste left behind after probiotics consume prebiotics. “They’re helpful for slowing the growth of harmful bacteria,” says Largeman-Roth, and they may help strengthen the intestinal barrier. The strains of probiotics included in this pill are two of the most well-studied varieties, shown to help support gut health and digestion via the growth of more healthy bacteria.</p><p><strong>Doses per bottle:</strong> 30<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Bacteriophages myoviridae and siphoveridae<br> <strong>Key strains of probiotics:</strong> Bifidobacterium anamalis ssp lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus<br> <strong>CFU count:</strong> 11 billion</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> Like many other Ritual products, Synbiotic+ is vegan, allergen-free, and third-party tested, notes Ajmera. She and Largeman-Roth both call out its mint-essenced flavor, which reviewers love. <em>Glamour</em> reviewer Sammy V., who works for a sports apparel brand, says she much prefers the taste of Ritual’s Synbiotic+ to other similar products she’s tried. “Taking Ritual on an empty stomach every morning has never upset my tummy, which is great,” she says, though it’s hard to tell if this prebiotic/probiotic combo has helped her stomach issues. “I wanted a subscription one that was a bit more simple. Ritual offered a nice multivitamin and pre-pro combo but didn’t try to push much else. Whereas other brands, for example, made me feel like if I was worried about everything (which I am) then I’d need five pills morning and night. And those made me nauseous.”</p><h2>Benefiber Prebiotic Fiber Supplement</h2><p>These powder sticks contain prebiotic fiber in the form of wheat dextrin, though it’s formulated in a way that meets FDA requirements for a gluten-free label. These little guys are individually packaged and super easy to take on the go. Dr. Mysore says Benefiber is a great addition to your diet if you’re feeling backed up, and offers good bang for your buck in terms of nourishing your microbiome. The easily dissolvable powder means you can take it with just water or even mix it into foods.</p><p><strong>Doses per box:</strong> 28<br> <strong>Types of prebiotic fiber:</strong> Wheat dextrin</p><p><strong>Key strain of probiotic:</strong> None</p><p><strong>CFU count:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Why we like it:</strong> “I’ve used this product because it’s easy to travel with,” says Largeman-Roth, who is a fan of Benefiber. “Unfortunately, traveling can wreak havoc on your digestion, often causing constipation due to changes in your routine. The clear product mixes in with water or juice and doesn’t have a flavor. If you like flavor, they also have a strawberry lemonade option. This is great if you’re already taking a probiotic or you just want to boost the amount of fiber you’re getting daily.”</p><h2>How do prebiotics impact gut health and overall health?</h2><h2>What are the downsides to taking prebiotics?</h2><figure><img title="What are the downsides to taking prebiotics?" src="IMG/BB1hdgyk_what_are_the_downsides_to_taking_prebiotics.jpg" alt="What are the downsides to taking prebiotics?"><figcaption><em>What are the downsides to taking prebiotics?.

Glamour</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Is it better to take prebiotics or probiotics?</h2><h2>What time of day should I take prebiotics?</h2><h2>What should you look for in a prebiotic supplement?</h2><p>When choosing a prebiotic supplement you want to look for reputable brands backed by clinical research that meet quality assurance standards, says Glassman. Look into the ingredients, especially if you’re picking out a combo product, and make sure the strains of probiotics included are ones specifically geared toward your health concerns. Trustworthy companies will make their manufacturing process transparent and the research they cite easily accessible. You’ll also want to look into how much prebiotic fiber the product contains. Per the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP), you need a dose of at least 3 grams of prebiotic fiber per day—or more—to see a benefit.</p><p>Third-party certifications are also a great sign. Look for ones from independent organizations, like the United States Pharmacopeia, NSF International, or ConsumerLab.com, which can help you feel confident in a product’s quality. Supplements that have been produced under Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP (a system that ensures product consistency and adherence to assurance standards) are also stand-outs.</p><figure><img title="What should you look for in a prebiotic supplement?" src="IMG/BB1hrxTZ_what_should_you_look_for_in_a_prebiotic_supplement.jpg" alt="What should you look for in a prebiotic supplement?"><figcaption><em>What should you look for in a prebiotic supplement?.
