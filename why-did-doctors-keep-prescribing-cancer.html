    <title>Why Did Doctors Keep Prescribing Cancer?</title>
    <meta name="description" content="For years, estrogen therapy was-and continues to be-prescribed as a treatment for women experiencing symptoms of menopause. Estrogen is a sex hormone found in both men and women (though in smaller amounts in men). The main source of estrogen is the ovaries in women, although the adrenal glands also make small amounts of this hormone […] The post Why Didn't Doctors Caution Patients About the Link Between Hormone Replacement Therapy and Cancer? appeared first on The Hearty Soul.">

    <main><h1>Why Did Doctors Keep Prescribing Cancer?</h1><h2>Years of Medical Advice without Science to Back It Up</h2><p>Although there were concerns that this treatment could contribute to the development of breast cancer, many physicians believed that the benefits outweighed the risks. So for over half a century, <em>"multiple observational studies</em>" were used to justify the beneficial effects of menopausal hormone therapy until a randomized clinical trial was done .</p><p>Women on these hormones seemed to have lower heart attack rates, and since heart disease was (and continues to be) the number one cause of death of women, these hormones seemed like a beneficial form of treatment all around .</p><p>However, there were other factors involved-for example, women who had access to this form of therapy also tended to be of higher socioeconomic class, which means they not only had a healthier diet but had regular checkups and tended to participate in exercise, which would have worked to lower their heart attack risk .</p><p>Doctors continued to prescribe estrogen without much science to back up this form of treatment-that is, until a large experiment conducted in the 1990s called the Women's Health Initiative revealed the dangers of menopausal hormone therapy.</p><figure><img title="Years of Medical Advice without Science to Back It Up" src="IMG/BB1n8AIS_years_of_medical_advice_without_science_to_back_it_up.jpg" alt="Years of Medical Advice without Science to Back It Up"><figcaption><em>Years of Medical Advice without Science to Back It Up.

It may also be used to manage risk for osteoporosis and heart disease later in life . However, research was soon published that prompted millions of women to stop taking their hormone medication.</p><p>One study was done on women from 50-79 years of age who had their uterus intact. These women received combined estrogen and progestin as a form of treatment and experienced invasive breast cancer and heart disease as a result. Based on the invasive breast cancer, the trial was halted prematurely .</p><p>The study concluded that the risks outweighed the benefits when using combined estrogen and progestin in healthy postmenopausal women .</p><p>Another study looked at women without their uteruses with estrogen therapy alone. These women, who spanned the same ages as the other group, saw an increased risk of stroke and blood clots, although an insignificant decrease was found in breast cancer incidents .</p><figure><img title="What the Women's Health Initiative Studies Revealed" src="IMG/BB1n8yoJ_what_the_womens_health_initiative_studies_revealed.jpg" alt="What the Women's Health Initiative Studies Revealed"><figcaption><em>What the Women's Health Initiative Studies Revealed.

Based on some research, when applied appropriately, hormone replacement therapy is considered to be beneficial .</p><p>Using hormone therapy for a limited amount of time a certain amount of time after menopause, experts insist that it has benefits, but only when used short-term and only as necessary . Today, the role of estrogen in breast cancer continues to be controversial. Some research shows that women who have had their uterus removed benefit from hormone replacement therapy and have fewer heart attacks .</p><p>For years, doctors believed the benefits of hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women outweighed the risks-with the results of the Women's Health Initiative in 2002, things seem to have changed. The problem is that patients and physicians alike are often in disagreement about the appropriate use and benefits of estrogen therapy.</p><figure><img title="So Why Didn't Doctors Caution Their Patients?" src="IMG/BB1n8tfT_so_why_didnt_doctors_caution_their_patients.jpg" alt="So Why Didn't Doctors Caution Their Patients?"><figcaption><em>So Why Didn't Doctors Caution Their Patients?.

(In addition, the word symptom is often associated with disease, which menopause is not!)</li>   <li><strong>Transgender women are affected too.</strong> Transgender women may take Premarin to induce female sex characteristics during their physical transition [18]. Some research shows that while taking these hormones, transgender women experience an increased risk of breast cancer [19].</li>   <li><strong>Watch out for pharmaceutical birth control.</strong> If you take oral birth control, you also have a slightly increased risk for breast cancer, as these hormones raise estrogen levels in the body [20].</li>  </ul><p>Today, your choice to take estrogen is an individual decision that can only be made by you after reviewing the risks and benefits with your trusted physician!</p></main>
