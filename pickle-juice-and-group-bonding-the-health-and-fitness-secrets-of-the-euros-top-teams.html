    <main><h1>Pickle juice and group bonding: The health and fitness secrets of the Euro’s top teams</h1><p>Sitting in front of the television watching the Euros all summer might be fun, but it’s not particularly healthy. By the time the football tournament reaches its final stages, some of us have been almost completely sedentary for almost a month, refuelling on a diet of heavily salted snacks and carbonated drinks. But, if you pay close attention, you might actually be able to improve your health and fitness while bingeing on non-stop football matches this summer. </p><p>The Euros is basically a gathering of the world’s most finely tuned, expensively developed young athletes. “There was a time when football lagged behind other sports in terms of sports science,” says James Witts, author of <em>Training Secrets Of The World’s Greatest Footballers: How Science Is Changing The Modern Game</em>.</p><p>“But nowadays, the sheer amount of money involved in the game means that elite football is at the very forefront of athletic conditioning. It’s about basic accountability: if you’re paying a player £300,000 a week, then you’d better make sure they are keeping in the best shape possible.” </p><p>For this reason, the latest trends in fitness, diet, recovery and sports psychology are all being driven by the Beautiful Game. Here’s what normal people with busy lives can learn from the training practices of Euro 24’s eight quarter-finalists.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Drink pickle juice like England</h2><p>“Every team at the tournament will focus on muscle recovery because the break between matches is so short,” says Nicolas Dyon, a football fitness coach who has worked with elite clubs in France and Switzerland. “Combating cramps in games requires proper hydration.”</p><p>When Kieran Trippier, England’s left back, suffered cramps in the opening match against Serbia, he was seen drinking a small sachet of ‘pickle juice’ at the side of the pitch. The unpleasant-sounding drink has been found in studies to reduce cramp 40 per cent faster than drinking plain water. Not only does it help replace lost salts during exercise due to its sodium potassium and vinegar content, it is also thought to help trigger a reflex in the mouth which sends signals to the brain to stop muscles from cramping.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1ptsnW_kieran_trippier_suffered_cramps.jpg" alt="Kieran Trippier suffered cramps"><figcaption><em>When Kieran Trippier suffered cramps in the opening match against Serbia, he was seen drinking a small sachet of 'pickle juice' - Icon Sport.

Studies also suggest it can help ease hangovers, control your blood sugar levels, boost gut health and prevent bad breath by killing bacteria that breeds in the mouth.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Frame pressure as a positive thing, like Germany</h2><p>A great mental approach for any of us who are trying to get back in the gym after a period of slothfulness: remember yourself at your very best and resolve to get back there.</p><p>Germany have not won a trophy since 2014 – an unusually long dry spell putting huge expectations on their talented squad. Young manager Julian Nagelsmann has encouraged his players to embrace the situation. “His technique is to remind them that they are under pressure precisely because they are the best,” says Jonathan Harding, author of <em>Mensch: Beyond The Cones</em>, a book about football coaching and culture in Germany.</p><p>After they defeated Denmark, Nagelssman said that he wanted his players to “delete their hard drives and recognise how good a team they are”. Rather than let the pressure make them nervous, he is asking them to channel it in a positive way, put negative memories in the past and perceive themselves as potential champions. The phrase he likes is “pressure is a privilege”.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1ptnUN_julian_nagelsmann_head_coach_of_germany_leads_a_training_session.jpg" alt="Julian Nagelsmann, head coach of Germany, leads a training session"><figcaption><em>Julian Nagelsmann, head coach of Germany, leads a training session - Shutterstock.

If our workouts are boring, stressful or overly exhausting, we will find any excuse we can to avoid them. “The Spanish tend to spend more time than most just playing with the ball,” says Andy Brassell, a writer, broadcaster and European football expert. </p><p>“This keeps them stimulated and mentally fresh – the players feel more engaged with the training. You can see it in their performances. There is a certain joy to the way Spain have played in this tournament so far. Whereas footballers used to be treated like school children and told what was good for them, now there is a greater focus on understanding what players actually enjoy.” It’s a reminder for all of us. </p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Stay focussed on your goal, like the Netherlands</h2><p>Blocking out negative thoughts to stay focussed on your own fitness goals breeds resilience. It helps footballers get through the high-pressure experience of a tournament.” When Gary Lineker described England’s performances in the group stage as “s--t,” several players seemed disgruntled and hit back at the BBC anchorman in subsequent interviews. </p><p>Not all teams are quite so sensitive. “Dutch players will have seen England’s response and laughed,” says Brassell. “Lineker’s words were gentle in comparison to the sort of thing the Dutch media throw at their team. The difference is that Dutch players are very used to that. They express opinions in a very forthright manner and don’t take criticism too personally.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Use tech like Turkey</h2><p>Popular apps like Strava and MyFitnessPal can perform a similar, personalised function for time-poor ordinary folk who want to monitor their health and fitness. “Turkish teams will also focus on quality of rest,” says Brassell. “They send advance parties to team hotels to make sure that every player has the same mattress and bed sheets as they do at home. They even fill rooms with pictures of loved ones to make them feel more relaxed. All of these things help optimise sleep in small ways.”</p><p>“The top clubs in Turkey have had to focus a huge amount on preparation and time management,” Brassell adds. It’s a familiar problem to anyone who has to juggle a long commute to a busy job with childcare and trips to the gym. The Turkish have combat these problems with meticulous planning on the go. “Each player will receive personalised videos informing them about opponents or analysing performances, which they watch on their phones while travelling to games.” </p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Bond like France</h2><p>A sense of togetherness is essential in any successful team sport. At tournaments like the Euros, it can be hard to keep non-playing squad players happy and motivated. But tournament favourites France have a tradition to combat this. “They call their squad players and substitutes Les Coiffeurs,” says Andy Brassell. “It means ‘the hairdressers’ and is pretty literal. In the past, the inactive players would spend their time cutting their teammates’ hair in the hotel rooms. They spend so long together in these resorts between games, they need stuff like that to keep them active and involved.” It seems improbable that this bonding habit has reached the England camp yet. But for any of us engaged in team sports, it’s always worth finding activities to bond over outside of match days.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1ptsoa_tournament_favourites_france_focus_on_bonding.jpg" alt="Tournament favourites France focus on bonding"><figcaption><em>Tournament favourites France focus on bonding to keep players' engaged - UEFA.

The band measures sleep, strain, recovery, stress, calories, and more, and offers personalised insights to help him increase every aspect of his health over time. “Tracking performance using tech is essential for modern athletes,” says Nicolas Dyon. &NoBreak;&NoBreak; “Footballers closely monitor wellness before each training session and use live data to avoid injury,  anticipate tiredness and optimise their training load accurately so as to be at their peak for the next match.” </p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1ptsol_cristiano_ronaldo_wears_a_whoop_tracking_device_on_his_wrist_which_measures_sleep_strain_recovery_stress.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo wears a WHOOP tracking device on his wrist, which measures sleep, strain, recovery, stress, calories, and more"><figcaption><em>Cristiano Ronaldo wears a WHOOP tracking device on his wrist, which measures sleep, strain, recovery, stress, calories, and more - Getty Images Europe.

This is said to keep  him cosier and help blood flow while he sleeps. According to the manufacturer, the hi-tech jim-jams can also help with arthritis (and menstrual pain). More research is needed, however, and the sleep set costs £150. It might be better to improve your sleep like NBA star LeBron James, who switches off all electricals 45 minutes before he goes to bed.</p><p><em>Recommended</em></p><p>Is this the tech that's going to win England the Euros?</p></main>
