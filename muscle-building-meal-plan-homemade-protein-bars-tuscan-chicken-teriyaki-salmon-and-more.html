In the heat of the summer, I prefer not to turn on my oven, so I love these two options--a simple slow-cooker recipe and refrigerated pudding. Both options are a great way to start your day with fruits and veggies.</p><p>Slow-Cooker Breakfast Sweet Potatoes by Casey Barber</p><p>Sweet potatoes are a starchy veggie that is delicious when topped with yogurt and chopped fruit. It’s the ultimate well-balanced breakfast with carbs for energy, yogurt for protein and fruit for antioxidants. These can help fuel your workout or repair tired muscles after a workout– a win-win!</p><p>Coconut Chia Pudding by Sweet Potato Chronicles</p><p>Chia pudding takes 5 minutes to make, and it’s yummy and high in protein. It’s a simple grab-and-go breakfast for busy mornings. Eat this after an early morning workout to help with muscle growth. </p><h2>Lunch</h2><p>Lunch should be delicious and satiating and quick to throw together. These options include colorful summer produce and tons of nutrients to boost mid-day energy. Plus, they can fuel an afternoon or evening workout. </p><p>Grilled Chicken with Peach-Dijon Glaze and Salad by Rick Martínez</p><p>A simple grilled chicken with a peach glaze over a bed of leafy greens sounds fancy, but it’s incredibly simple. This lunchtime recipe is full of protein to keep you full and contribute to muscle growth. </p><p>Couscous Salad with Watermelon and Feta by Will Coleman</p><p>This gorgeous salad combines seasonal summer fruits and veggies with pearled couscous under a herby vinaigrette. It’s truly easy to make and delicious. Top it with your favorite protein, like chickpeas, black beans, grilled salmon, chicken or tuna. </p><h2>Dinner</h2><p>Dinner is the meal that most people struggle to find the time to make, so this week’s picks are tasty, quick and enticing. Eat any of these meals after a workout to get plenty of muscle-building protein and inflammation-fighting antioxidants. Even if you skipped the workout that day or are on a weight loss journey, you’ll love how filling and nutritious these meals are. </p><p>Baked Vegetable Pasta with Pickled Peppers by Yasmin Fahr</p><p>Treat yourself to a hearty baked pasta on a Monday! It may look decadent, but it’s packed with veggies, like broccoli, mushrooms, herbs and peppers. Ricotta cheese has a lot of vegetarian protein, so this meal will keep you full long after eating. </p><p>Tuscan Chicken by Alexis deBoschnek</p><p>There’s nothing better than a comforting one-pan meal in the summer. This creamy Tuscan chicken includes cherry tomatoes and spinach and sits in a creamy sauce. To reduce the fat, use ¼ cup of chicken broth instead of the butter, and try half-and-half instead of heavy cream. </p><p>One-Pan Teriyaki Salmon by Jessica Sepel</p><p>The only way I’m asking you to turn on your oven in the summer is for a one-pan meal. This simple teriyaki salmon is flavorful, full of heart-healthy omega-3’s and includes veggies, like sweet potatoes and broccoli. You’re going to love the ease of preparation and minimal clean-up. </p><p>Trisha Yearwood's 'Sweet-Pea' Burgers by Trisha Yearwood</p><p>Embrace the small but mighty chickpea with this delicious veggie burger recipe. This tasty meatless recipe is great for your health and your wallet. </p><h2>Snacks</h2><p>This meal plan includes two types of snacks. The first is carb-rich pre-workout snacks to prevent fatigue during a workout. And the second is post-workout snacks with carbs and protein to aid in muscle recovery and growth. </p><h3>Pre-workout snacks</h3><p>These snacks emphasize carbohydrates, which are the main fuel source for exercise. Ingredients like bananas and oats offer healthy carbs to prevent fatigue during exercise. Eat any of these snacks 60-minutes before a workout to feel that extra burst of energy. </p><p>Dark Chocolate Granola by Will Coleman</p><p>Banana 'Sushi' by Rachel Mansfield</p><p>Dylan Dreyer's Oatmeal-Banana Balls with Chocolate Chips by Dylan Dreyer</p><p>After a workout, the muscles need a combination of carbohydrates and protein to recover, grow and reduce fatigue. Recovery nutrition also prevents you from getting too hungry and overeating other less healthy foods. These two options are simple to make and check all the boxes. </p><p>Honey Nut Protein Bars by Daphne Oz</p><p>PB & Berry Breakfast Bowl by Joy Bauer</p></main>
