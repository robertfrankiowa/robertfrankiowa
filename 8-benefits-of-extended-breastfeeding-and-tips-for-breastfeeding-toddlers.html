    <main><h1>8 benefits of extended breastfeeding – and tips for breastfeeding toddlers</h1><p>It's not always easy to continue your breastfeeding journey once your baby's not so little anymore. You may be feeling judged and wonder whether it's time for weaning.</p><p>The fact is, there are significant benefits to extended breastfeeding, so don't let others pressure you to stop before you and your child are ready.</p><p>"Mothers who decide to breastfeed beyond the first year need support," says the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). "They often report feeling ridiculed or alienated in their choice and conceal their breastfeeding behavior to minimize unsolicited judgement and comments."</p><p>Monica Murphy, RNC, IBCLC, an inpatient and outpatient lactation consultant and member of the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board, makes a point of encouraging moms who choose extended breastfeeding.</p><p>"I take the time to congratulate them for their commitment and dedication," she says. "They should be acknowledged, since all of the leading health experts agree on the nutritional and immunological benefits of extended breastfeeding, as well as it being good for overall well-being."</p><h2>What is extended breastfeeding?</h2><p>Extended breastfeeding means breastfeeding for longer than might be expected. In the United States, extended breastfeeding generally means nursing past your baby's first birthday. In many countries, however, breastfeeding for much longer is considered normal, healthy, and common – and not at all "extended."</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States:</p><ul> <li>about 83% of babies are breastfeed at birth</li> <li>at 3 months, 71% of babies are breastfed</li> <li>at 6 months, 58% of babies are breastfed</li> <li>at age 1, 38% of babies are breastfed</li> </ul><h2>When should you stop breastfeeding?</h2><p>It's entirely up to you. You may decide that you're ready to stop, or you may have other reasons. Or maybe you want to keep breastfeeding, but your active toddler just isn't interested anymore.</p><p>If you do want to keep nursing, however, you have plenty of support from experts.</p><p>The AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, meaning a baby has only breast milk – no other liquids or foods. The group supports breastfeeding for 2 years or more if you and your child want, and recommends giving baby foods starting at about 6 months.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recommend that babies begin breastfeeding at birth and breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months. Foods can be introduced at 6 months, they say, while breastfeeding continues for two years or more.</p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends babies be breastfed exclusively for the first six months of life. They also support breastfeeding beyond this time frame for as long as mutually desired by mother and child.</p><p>The USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends breastfeeding until children are 12 months or older, along with providing complementary foods.</p><h2>Benefits of extended breastfeeding</h2><p>The benefits of breastfeeding are well documented. Breast milk provides your baby with antibodies that protect them from illness now and in the future. Breastfeeding may lower your baby's risk of allergies, eczema, and obesity and boost their cognitive development. There are benefits for moms, too, from reducing the risk of postpartum depression to lowering stress levels and reducing the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.</p><p>While you and your baby will benefit from any amount of breastfeeding, the advantages accumulate over time. "For many outcomes," says WHO, "the positive effect of breastfeeding is greater the longer breastfeeding is continued."</p><p>Extended breastfeeding can provide:</p><ul> <li><strong>Continued nutrition</strong>. Even once your child gets most of their nutrition from solid food, breast milk still provides calories, growth hormones, valuable immunities, vitamins, probiotics, and enzymes. In fact, breast milk changes to meet your baby's needs. Research has shown that breast milk from mothers who have been lactating for more than a year has significantly increased fat and energy contents – perfect for an active toddler – compared with the breast milk of women who have been lactating for a shorter time.</li> <li><strong>Added protection from illness</strong>. Studies show that breastfeeding toddlers are sick less often than their peers. And, according to the AAP, research shows that children who nurse for more than 6 months are less likely to develop childhood leukemia and lymphoma than formula-fed children, perhaps because of their strengthened immune system.</li> <li><strong>Help during illness</strong>. When a toddler gets sick, breast milk may be the only thing they'll consume. This helps them stay hydrated and boosts their immune system.</li> <li><strong>Health benefits for Mom</strong>. "There are continued benefits from breastfeeding beyond 1 year, and up to 2 years, especially for the breastfeeding parent's health," says the AAP. "This includes protection against diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancers of the breast and ovaries."</li> <li><strong>Comfort</strong>. Breastfeeding can be an important source of reassurance and emotional support. If you travel and stay overnight in unfamiliar places (or move to a new home), for example, the comfort of breastfeeding may be the best way to ease your child's fears and make them feel more secure. This support may be helpful as your child becomes more self-reliant, too. The strong connection your child feels with you while nursing will foster independence, not make them overly dependent or clingy.</li> <li><strong>Menstrual delay</strong>. You may be able to delay getting your period for a year or more­ – an advantage if you dread the thought of dealing with cramps and bloating again. (But remember that you can get pregnant while breastfeeding.)</li> <li><strong>Weight control</strong>. Continued breastfeeding may help with weight. Some research shows that breastfeeding combined with a healthy diet and exercise may keep you slimmer for years to come.</li> <li><strong>An easier transition</strong>. Weaning your child when you're both ready can feel more natural and less abrupt than picking an arbitrary end point.</li> </ul><h2>Tips for extended breastfeeding</h2><ul> <li>Have some responses ready when someone asks you the inevitable question: "Is your toddler still nursing?" Sometimes a simple "yes" is the best response. Or, the next time you're nursing in public and someone asks, "Are you ever going to stop breastfeeding?" you could say, "Yes, in about 10 minutes."</li> <li>Don't feel that you need to continue nursing on demand, which is the recommended way to breastfeed infants, unless you want to. Maybe you don't want to stop in the middle of errands to breastfeed your toddler. It's okay to have them wait until it's convenient. Some moms prefer nursing at set times during the day – like in the morning, before naps, or before bedtime – and have their toddlers drink from a cup during meals and snacks.</li> <li>If your child seems to be nursing out of boredom or to get your attention, engage them in other ways. Toddlers are eager to explore the world and need stimulation to fuel their rapid development.</li> <li>Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy breastfeeding diet that includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, protein, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods. To stay hydrated, drink a glass of water every time you breastfeed. And if you're not sure you're getting all the nutrition you need, talk to your healthcare provider or a dietitian.</li> <li>Make sure your toddler is also eating nutritious, well-balanced meals so they continue to grow at a healthy rate.</li> <li>If you're pregnant and breastfeeding, be prepared for your milk supply to change with your hormone levels. You might produce less milk as your body starts redirecting resources toward your developing baby, and the taste of your breast milk may change. But many women can nurse a toddler while pregnant – it just takes extra time and energy, so you'll need to be doubly sure you're eating well and drinking enough fluids.</li> </ul><h2>How to wean after extended breastfeeding</h2><p>Weaning a busy toddler who's eager to move to the next activity may be easier than weaning a younger child. Or it may be harder – especially if you have a stubborn child who digs in their heels about things.</p><p>Here are some tips that can make weaning your toddler a little easier:</p></main>
