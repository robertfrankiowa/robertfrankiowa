    <main><h1>Are Luxury Fitness and Sports Recovery Destinations Replacing Spas?</h1><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Is the traditional spa dead? A crop of new, luxury sports destinations - think pain recovery and lavish sports facilities - might argue, yes. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> As the wellness boom causes an uptick in services, high-end fitness and sports recovery programs are the hot experiences to try right now. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> "There has been a significant rise in luxury fitness and recovery concepts," says Dr. Jonathan Leary, founder of social self care destination Remedy Place. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Equinox may have been one of the first to make fitness luxe, but newer concepts like Padel Haus are staking their claim in the market. Sports hospitality, too - such as new fitness-centric hotel concept Siro - is a growing trend, according to the Global Wellness Institute. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Now, with a slew of new devices, treatments and luxe locations, customers are regularly communing at sports destinations like they would a spa. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> "We are seeing a growing demand for advanced, science-backed experiences that provide both immediate and long-term benefits," Leary says. "Treatments like cryotherapy, infrared saunas, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and lymphatic compression are becoming increasingly popular due to their effectiveness in enhancing recovery, reducing inflammation and improving overall performance." </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Therabody, known for its massage guns, operates a chain of recovery-centric outposts called Reset by Therabody that offer a slew of recovery treatments like lymphatic drainage and infrared saunas, and sees a wide variety of clients, according to Therabody executive chairman and chief strategy officer Benjamin Nazarian. Clients are coming in both for sports recovery and overall longevity. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> With this segment on the rise, here's a look at five concepts combining sports with a luxury, spa-like feel. </p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> 1. Optimize by Equinox </h2><figure><img title="Provided by WWD" src="IMG/BB1ogg0L_equinox_launches_optimize_by_equinox.jpg" alt="Equinox launches Optimize by Equinox."><figcaption><em>Optimize by Equinox. Provided by WWD</em></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> "[Equinox is] a luxury experiential brand and so what goes within our four walls and locker rooms is something that is of higher standards and a very rigorous development process," Julia Klim, Equinox's vice president of strategic partnerships and business development, tells WWD. </p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> 2. Siro One Za'abeel </h2><figure><img title="Provided by WWD" src="IMG/BB1ogaMd_siro_hotel.jpg" alt="Siro Hotel"><figcaption><em>Siro Hotel. Provided by WWD</em></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Luxury wellness hotel Siro's Za'abeel, Dubai-based location by Kerzner International is built around five key pillars of biohacking: sleep, nutrition, mindfulness, recovery and of course, fitness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> The hotel has its Fitness Lab with up to 50 specialized workout classes weekly, personal training and an array of gym equipment. In the Recovery Lab, guests can opt into performance-enhancing treatments, including electric muscle stimulation, compression therapy, cryotherapy, IV drips and more. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> With the successful opening in Dubai, a new Siro location will open in Montenegro later this year, with hotels in Los Cabos, Mexico, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to follow in 2027 and 2028, respectively. </p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> 3. Remedy Place </h2><figure><img title="Provided by WWD" src="IMG/BB1ogne1_remedy_place_ice_bath_studio.jpg" alt="Remedy Place Ice Bath Studio"><figcaption><em>Remedy Place Ice Bath Studio.. Provided by WWD</em></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> While Remedy Place has made a name for itself as a social wellness destination, where guests are prompted to enjoy treatments and services together, many of the treatments are centered around sports recovery specifically - think hot and cold therapy and lymphatic drainage. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> "We've seen firsthand how social interactions can amplify the benefits of traditional self care routines, especially when comparing them to isolated spa experiences," Leary says. "When people come together with a shared purpose, whether it's in a sauna suite or our breathwork ice bath class, they not only realize how much better they feel but they also witness the power of connecting with who they're doing it with." </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Remedy Place currently has outposts in the Flatiron neighborhood of New York City and West Hollywood, with more on the way. </p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> 4. Reset by Therabody </h2><figure><img title="Provided by WWD" src="IMG/BB1ogqw0_reset_by_therabody_manhattan_west.jpg" alt="Reset by Therabody Manhattan West"><figcaption><em>Reset by Therabody Manhattan West.. Provided by WWD</em></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Reset by Therabody has locations in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Manhattan Beach, Calif., where guests can experience Therabody devices, as well as sports recovery treatments like infrared sauna sessions, cryotherapy, manual stretching and more. According to the team, contrast therapy, which can be helpful in boosting circulation and easing pain, is particularly sought after.</p><h2 class="heading larva //  lrv-a-font-primary-xl u-font-size-38@desktop-xl u-font-size-26 u-font-size-22@mobile-max  "> 5. Padel Haus </h2><figure><img title="Provided by WWD" src="IMG/BB1ogg0V_padel_haus.jpg" alt="Padel Haus"><figcaption><em>Padel Haus. Provided by WWD</em></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> Padel Haus combines sports, social time and luxury under one roof. Following the padel boom post-COVID-19, the concept has opened several locations across New York City and now is expanding to Nashville with its biggest club yet. </p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m  "> The new location, set to open in August, will include eight indoor courts, a juice bar, rain showers, a rock-climbing wall and social and coworking spaces. Plus, more ultra-luxe padel locations are on the way. According to Padel Haus founder and chief executive officer Santiago Gomez, the company plans to grow its East Coast presence and expand nationwide, as padel continues to gain traction as a social sport. </p><strong>More from WWD</strong></main>
