And a large body of research has shown it's safe. Still, several myths about fasting have gained traction among clinicians, journalists and the general public: that fasting can lead to a poor diet or loss of lean muscle mass, cause eating disorders, or decrease sex hormones.</p><p>In a new commentary in <i>Nature Reviews Endocrinology</i>, UIC researchers debunk each of these. They base their conclusions on clinical studies, some of which they conducted and some done by others.</p><p>"I've been studying intermittent fasting for 20 years, and I'm constantly asked if the diets are safe," said lead author Krista Varady, professor of kinesiology and nutrition at UIC. "There is a lot of misinformation out there. However, those ideas are not based on science; they're just based on personal opinion."</p><p>There are two main types of intermittent fasting. With alternate-day eating, people alternate between days of eating a very small number of calories and days of eating what they want. With time-restricted eating, people eat what they want during a four- to 10-hour window each day, then don't eat during the rest of the day. The researchers conclude both types are safe despite the popular myths.</p><p>Here's a look at their conclusions:</p><h2>Intermittent fasting does not lead to a poor diet</h2><p>The researchers point to studies showing the intake of sugar, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, sodium and caffeine do not change during fasting compared with before a fast. And the percentage of energy consumed in carbohydrates, protein and fat doesn't change, either.</p><h2>Intermittent fasting does not cause eating disorders</h2><p>None of the studies show that fasting caused participants to develop an eating disorder. However, all the studies screened out participants who had a history of eating disorders, and the researchers say that those with a history of eating disorders should not try intermittent fasting. They also urge pediatricians to be cautious when monitoring obese adolescents if they start fasting, because this group has a high risk of developing eating disorders.</p><h2>Intermittent fasting does not cause excessive loss of lean muscle mass</h2><p>The studies show that people lose the same amount of lean muscle mass whether they're losing weight by fasting or with a different diet. In both cases, resistance training and increased protein intake can counteract the loss of lean muscle.</p><h2>Intermittent fasting does not affect sex hormones</h2><p>Despite concerns about fertility and libido, neither estrogen, testosterone nor other related hormones are affected by fasting, the researchers said.</p><p>The other authors of the article are Vanessa Oddo and Sofia Cienfuegos at UIC and Shuhao Lin, formerly at UIC and now at the Mayo Clinic.</p><small>                 This story was originally published on Medical Xpress.
