    <main><h1>20-Minute Full-Body Workout You Can Do in Your Living Room</h1><p>If you want to get a full-body workout in the comfort of your own home, investing in a few kettlebells is a must. "One of the greatest aspects of using a kettlebell for exercising is that you can use one light or medium kettlebell weight and an area roughly the size of a yoga mat to get a fun, full body strength and conditioning workout in as little as 15 or 20 minutes," Nikolai Puchlov, Head Coach & Founder, Pro Kettlebell, tells <em>Body Network</em>. He created a home kettlebell workout exclusively for our readers, which tones and strengthens your entire body.</p><figure><img title="20-Minute Full-Body Workout You Can Do in Your Living Room" src="IMG/BB1machS_20_minute_full_body_workout_you_can_do_in_your_living_room.jpg" alt="20-Minute Full-Body Workout You Can Do in Your Living Room"><figcaption><em>20-Minute Full-Body Workout You Can Do in Your Living Room. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 What to Know Before You Start</h2><p>A great thing about kettlebell workouts is that they are high-intensity, low-impact, and can burn a lot of calories in a short time. And, like other forms of strength and weight training, you continue to burn more calories post-workout than other cardio-based forms due to post-exercise oxygen consumption. Puchlov adds that they help strengthen your muscles and joints and "provide cardio benefits at the same time." This workout can easily be modified to the appropriate level by using lighter or heavier kettlebell weights and/or increasing or decreasing the pace at which you perform the exercise. </p><h2>2 Bodyweight Warm Up</h2><p>First, start with a short bodyweight warm-up.</p><p>1. 30 seconds of air squats</p><p>2. 30 seconds of toe touches</p><p>3. 30 seconds of standing folding stars</p><p>4. 30 seconds of high knees</p><h2>3 Buns and Guns Kettlebell Exercises</h2><p>The first set of kettlebell exercises works the "buns and guns," says Puchlov.</p><p>1.
