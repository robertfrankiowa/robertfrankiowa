    <main><h1>The 15 Best Superfoods to Add to Your Diet</h1><h2>Avocado</h2><p>More than just a trendy food for local eateries, avocado is great for you. It's full of protein and healthy fats as well as very filling without being bad for you. Add it to your rice, throw some slices on your toast, or have it with eggs. It's all good!</p><figure><img title="Avocado" src="IMG/BB1ph9Sb_avocado.jpg" alt="Avocado"><figcaption><em>Avocado.

If you like sushi, salmon goes great in hand rolls or as sashimi. Or, if you're looking for something more conventional, seared salmon steaks make for a classy dinner.</p><figure><img title="Salmon" src="IMG/BB1pgYz0_salmon.jpg" alt="Salmon"><figcaption><em>Salmon.

They can help reduce your risks for heart disease, too! Not to mention, they're really tasty. Just make sure you don't serve them to anyone with a nut allergy!</p><h2>Broccoli</h2><p>Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables (that's cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, and the like) are a great source of fiber. They're also rich in the vitamins your body needs to build muscle and keep you healthy! Make sure to work these into your lunches and dinners.</p><h2>Leafy Greens</h2><p>You need leafy greens in your diet for vitamin A and vitamin C, which are critical for your overall health. They're also rich in calcium, which is great for your bones. Spinach, collard greens, and chard are all good examples of this kind of green.</p><h2>Eggs</h2><p>If you're not eating eggs with your breakfast (or any other meal for that matter) then you need to remedy that. Eggs are a stellar source of protein, and they're jammed full of nutrients that will help you build muscle and stay in shape.</p><h2>Ginger</h2><p>You might not eat a lot of ginger, but you should if youâ€™d like to see some health benefits. Ginger is common in Eastern cuisine and deserves a spot on your plate, too! It offers a variety of nutrients your body needs in a tasty, spicy package.</p><h2>Blueberries</h2><p>Blueberries aren't just delicious, they're also great for you. They're loaded with fiber and antioxidants, and they're really great to eat if you're fighting off some kind of illness like a flu or cold. Add them to your yogurt if you don't want to just snack on them!</p><figure><img title="Blueberries" src="IMG/BB1ph5xl_blueberries.jpg" alt="Blueberries"><figcaption><em>Blueberries.

Of course, that assumes you're not getting a variety of yogurt that's super high in sugar. Get plain yogurt and sweeten it with berries or other healthy fruits. You'll get lots of great probiotics for your trouble!</p><h2>Sweet Potatoes</h2><p>The name of the game with sweet potatoes is "antioxidants." These tasty little root vegetables are full of them! They're also high in fiber and vitamins, and you can have them every day as long as you're eating plenty of calcium (remember those leafy greens)!</p><figure><img title="Sweet Potatoes" src="IMG/BB1ph5xp_sweet_potatoes.jpg" alt="Sweet Potatoes"><figcaption><em>Sweet Potatoes.

And that's a shame, because these tasty red fruits are loaded with vitamin C and have been shown to reduce the likelihood of certain cancers. Try to get them into your diet in a way you can stomach if you don't already eat them!</p><h2>Olive Oil</h2><p>Olive oil might be expensive, but it's a rare healthy fat that can actually be used in a variety of recipes without introducing ingredients that are bad for you. Consider cooking your meats and veggies in olive oil instead of things like butter or margarine.</p><h2>Whole Grains</h2><p>You should be eating more whole grains. Not just the partial grains, mind you, but the whole thing! Jokes aside, whole grains have B vitamins, lots of minerals, and can help lower your cholesterol. They're also capable of protecting you from diabetes and heart disease!</p><h2>Legumes</h2><p>Okay, "legumes" doesn't really narrow it down, but stick with this one. Kidney beans, black beans, soybeans, peas, and other foods in this category are great sources of protein and fiber. In fact, a lot of vegan athletes rely heavily on legumes for the amount of protein they need to stay in shape!</p><h2>Green Tea</h2><p>Sure, green tea isn't technically a "food," but it gets good nutrients into your body, so just roll with it. The best thing you get from green tea is a truckload of antioxidants, which are good for your overall health.</p></main>
