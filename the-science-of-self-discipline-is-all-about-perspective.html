Either you eat the cookie, or you don't. You cave and pour yourself a drink after work, or you head to the gym. Previously, it was believed people were either good or bad at resisting these temptations; they were either disciplined or not. However, recent insights challenge the notion that willpower is fixed and finite. By understanding the role of mindset in shaping our reserves of self-control, individuals can unlock strategies to bolster their willpower, leading to enhanced productivity and happiness.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Challenging the Myth of Fixed Willpower</h2><p>Until recently, the prevailing psychological theory proposed that willpower resembled a kind of battery, writes David Robson, a science writer and author of <em>The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life</em>. "You might start the day with full strength, but each time you have to control your thoughts, feelings or behavior, you zap that battery's energy," he writes. "Without the chance to rest and recharge, those resources run dangerously low, making it far harder to maintain your patience and concentration, and to resist temptation."</p><p>‍</p><p>This theory is/was known as "ego depletion". People who had high self-control might have bigger reserves of willpower initially, but even they would be worn down when placed under pressure. However recent studies show that our personal beliefs about willpower may be more influential than actual resource depletion.</p><p>‍</p><p>In 2010, a study published in <em>Psychological Science</em> indicated there were two distinct perspectives that influenced willpower and self-discipline: limited and non-limited mindsets. </p><p>‍</p><ol>  <li><strong>Limited mindset: </strong>These individuals feel that mental exertion exhausts resources, making it harder to resist temptations. </li>  <li><strong>Non-limited mindset:</strong> These individuals believe mental stamina replenishes itself, enabling them to resist temptations more effectively. </li>  </ol><p>‍</p><p>The study found that those with a non-limited mindset tend to be more productive even after a busy day, while those with a limited mindset feel less energized and productive. But here's the thing: The research shows how you think about willpower and determination tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>‍</p><p>In other words, if you think being busy provides the fuel to keep you staying busy, then that's what happens. If you think being too busy is draining and requires a period of rest, reset, and even "reward," then that's what happens.</p><p>‍</p><p>Just as willpower is not finite, the mindset that triggers it is not set in stone, either. It's all about our perspective.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Breaking the Barriers of Self-Imposed Limits</h2><p>Shifting from a limited to a non-limited mindset can be transformative, but it requires intentional effort, explains Veronika Job, a motivational psychology professor at the University of Vienna who published the study describing the different mindsets.  </p><p>‍</p><p>"I would not say people have <em>infinite</em> reservoirs of self-control, but it's more like this very simplistic idea of a muscle," she says. "Some people think if you use it once it gets fatigued. That's not how our self-control works." </p><p>‍</p><p>She says, for one, information is power: knowing the science of how mindsets influence self-discipline is a step toward developing more willpower. Additionally, she recommends that you "pursue goals you actually like." If it feels good to do something, you're more likely to choose to do it again.</p><p>‍</p><p>Reflecting on past experiences, too, where you surpassed perceived limits or deliberately pushed beyond self-imposed boundaries can aid in embracing a non-limited mindset. A study published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> found that thinking back on a time when you worked on a difficult task well past what you might have considered your limits can help you better embrace a non-limited mindset. Another study suggests that purposely pushing oneself past a self-imposed limit, such as exercising after 6 p.m. if one typically avoids it, can facilitate this shift. This mental shift not only enhances willpower but also cultivates resilience and perseverance, crucial attributes for navigating life's obstacles.</p><p>‍</p><p>Still, there is no "silver bullet" to developing more willpower. Studies show these perspectives begin to form in us when we're in kindergarten, and undoing patterns won't happen overnight. But we do have the power to train and mold behaviors to best suit our lives today, and that change can be hugely beneficial.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Ultimately, mastering self-discipline isn't about enduring hardship but about shifting perspectives and unlocking the boundless potential within. By challenging the myth of fixed willpower and embracing a non-limited mindset, individuals can tap into their innate reserves of resilience and perseverance. While there's no shortcut to developing willpower, adopting strategies that align with one's preferences and strengths can make the journey more enjoyable and sustainable. </p><p>‍</p><h2>Sources</h2><p>BBC</p><p>Inc</p><p>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</p><p>Psychological Science</p><p>Frontiers in Psychology</p><p>CNBC</p><p>‍</p><p>Dr. Livingston enjoys taking care of patients from the mild to the wild.
