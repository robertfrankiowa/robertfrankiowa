    <main><h1>18 Effective Ways to Continue Working Well Into Your 70s</h1><p><p>There is evidence to suggest that the longer you work, the longer you live. Furthermore, continuing work in your 70s can have numerous benefits, including financial stability, mental engagement, and social interaction. While many people long for the days of retirement when they can kick back and do as little as possible, others dread the thought and want to keep working for as long as possible. Here are 18 ways to help you keep working into your 70s.</p><figure><img title="18 Effective Ways to Continue Working Well Into Your 70s" src="IMG/BB1lU7Gw_18_effective_ways_to_continue_working_well_into_your_70s.jpg" alt="18 Effective Ways to Continue Working Well Into Your 70s"><figcaption><em>18 Effective Ways to Continue Working Well Into Your 70s.

With a lifetime's worth of experience and knowledge, you will be an expert at something by the time you reach 70, so why not log on and offer your services online? Numerous platforms, such as Fiverr and Upwork, allow anyone to register as a freelancer and offer services such as editing, administration support, accountancy, coaching, writing, and creative design. </p><h2>Volunteering</h2><p>If you don’t feel like the full-time commitment of employment, <strong>volunteering </strong>can give you all of the benefits of working with fewer constraints. Plus, volunteering allows you to choose a cause you’re passionate about and give back to it meaningfully while also benefitting from social engagement, routine, and the mental agility required for working. </p><h2>Consulting</h2><p>By reaching your 70s, you can offer consulting services in some areas. Whether it’s investing, people management, or interior design, you most likely have some hidden knowledge and skills that people would love to hear about and pay you for, too.</p><h2>Tutoring</h2><p>You might not have considered yourself a teacher or tutor before, but you most likely have some skills that young people or even children are keen to learn, and this could be quite a lucrative yet flexible way to keep working and earning into your 70s. We're sure that you have something that you are passionate about, whether it’s playing tennis, baking, painting, or DIY. Now is the time for you to indulge in your passions. </p><h2>Remote Work</h2><p>Working from home makes any kind of job much more accessible to people who might normally struggle to sit in an office for 40+ hours per week. </p><p>Whether you have some health issues in your later years or caring responsibilities for your grandchildren, <strong>remote work</strong> is a great option that allows seniors to work flexible hours from the comfort of their own homes. </p><figure><img title="Remote Work" src="IMG/BB1n2Aag_remote_work.jpg" alt="Remote Work"><figcaption><em>Remote Work.

Part-time work offers seniors the option of working fewer hours, like 15 or 20 hours per week, which you might find much more manageable than a 50-hour work week.</p><h2>Starting a Business</h2><p>Why not use all those years of life experience to <strong>start your own business?</strong> It could be something simple like baking cakes in your kitchen or making tables in your garage, but it’s still work. It would mean that you would be more in control of your own time, and finally, you could be your own boss.</p><figure><img title="Starting a Business" src="IMG/BB1mIqkn_starting_a_business.jpg" alt="Starting a Business"><figcaption><em>Starting a Business.

Usually, there is a small fee to pitch a stall, or you could ask other traders if they need staff, either way, markets are great for social interaction, stimulating the mind, and making a bit of extra money. </p><h2>Public Speaking</h2><p>You might be surprised to learn that there is a high demand for public speakers in almost any subject. This can also be quite a lucrative business. Another benefit of this work is that instead of working 40+ hours per week, you can earn the same amount for a couple of hours of work.</p><figure><img title="Public Speaking" src="IMG/BB1oNXNx_public_speaking.jpg" alt="Public Speaking"><figcaption><em>Public Speaking.

Coaching is a great way to keep working into your 70s, and all it involves is sharing some of your life wisdom and kindness.  </p><h2>Technology</h2><p>If you want to stay active in the workplace into your 70s, keeping up with technology will be your greatest asset, along with your life experience, of course. <br>In 2024, nearly all forms of work require IT literacy, so knowing how to use a computer or smartphone and process electronic payments are all skills that will help keep you in the labor market. </p><h2>Courses</h2><p>No matter what age you are, we all need to refresh our skills and knowledge now and again to keep up to date with new information, working practices, etc. Taking courses at your local college or online can boost your confidence and skills and make you more appealing to employers. </p><h2>Crafting / Art</h2><p>Another great way to keep working into your 70s is to start making crafts or handmade art. Crafting can be a profitable venture, whether it’s hand-knitted blankets, paintings, or handmade baskets. Plus, engaging in making art has been shown to benefit our physical and mental well-being<strong>. </strong></p><h2>Board Membership</h2><p>You hear about many seniors sitting on boards of big companies or local organizations, and this is because board membership is seen as a privileged position that is not only well respected but also well-remunerated in some circumstances. </p><h2>Real Estate</h2><p><strong>Selling real estate</strong> can reap big financial rewards for relatively low input, and if you want to keep working into your 70s, a job that doesn't require too much physical exertion is usually a good idea. </p><p>Therefore, showing potential buyers around nice properties is a great option for seniors who are keen to keep working into their 70s. </p><h2>Investing</h2><p>By the age of 70, I’m sure that you know a thing or two about money and investing. Why not use some of that knowledge to start investing in the stock markets or helping others manage theirs? Yes, it can be a risky business, but with some patience and life experience, of which you likely have both, investing can be quite a profitable venture. </p><h2>Garden Design</h2><p>People love their gardens, and if horticulture is something that you enjoy, you could become a garden designer in your senior years. This means you still get to work with plants and enjoy the outdoors without any of the heavy lifting of being an actual gardener. </p><h2>Driver</h2><p>Driving is a great option for anyone who wants to keep working into their 70s because not only do you get to enjoy relaxing in your car, but you also get to utilize your brain for driving, maps, and navigating directions on your client's journeys. </p><h2>19 Grim Realities of Dating After 50 That Are Often Overlooked</h2><p>19 Grim Realities of Dating After 50 That Are Often Overlooked</p><h2>26 Things That Will Be Extinct Because Millennials Refuse to Buy Them</h2><p>26 Things That Will Be Extinct Because Millennials Refuse to Buy Them</p><h2>24 Outdated Slang Terms You Absolutely Shouldn’t Be Using Anymore</h2><p>24 Outdated Slang Terms You Absolutely Shouldn’t Be Using Anymore</p><h2>25 Hardest Parts About Getting Older That No One Ever Talks About</h2><p>25 Hardest Parts About Getting Older That No One Ever Talks About</p></main>
