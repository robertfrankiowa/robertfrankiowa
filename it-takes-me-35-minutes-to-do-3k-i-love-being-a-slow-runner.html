    <main><h1>It takes me 35 minutes to do 3K. I love being a slow runner</h1><p>As I jogged through my local park, I took in all the tell-tale signs that autumn had finally arrived.</p><p>The leaves were starting to turn red and gold, there were plenty of puddles to splash through on the pavement after a recent storm, and there was certainly a slight chill in the air.</p><p>In fact, I spent so much time taking in my surroundings, that I’d completely forgotten all about my distance and speed.</p><p>By the time I reached home I realised it had taken me 35 minutes to run a 3K – hardly record breaking, and a long way from my personal best pace. Yet, I wasn’t the least bit concerned.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, I’d felt a sense of joy with jogging.</p><p>I didn’t start running until I was in my mid-thirties. I’d managed the occasional 400 metres in PE at school, but much preferred other forms of exercise such as gymnastics or dance.</p><p>Like many people looking to keep fit without needing a gym membership or expensive equipment, I decided it was my best option. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1i44G5_sarah_standing_in_front_of_a_white_wall_wearing_running_gear_and_a_marathon_sign_on_her_top_that_reads_10.jpg" alt="Sarah standing in front of a white wall, wearing running gear and a marathon sign on her top that reads '10841'"><figcaption><em>Runner’s high is definitely real (Picture: Sarah McPherson). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>I started with Couch to 5K, following the run-walk-run approach, and after a few false starts I made it to the end of the programme. At some point along the way I realised I was enjoying myself on runs rather than just ticking off a workout. I ran 5K non-stop and then I kept going.</p><p>I realised pretty quickly that I was built for endurance rather than sprinting, and as a beginner, I made steady improvements.</p><p>Gradually I worked my way up to longer distances – I trained for a 10K race, then a half marathon – then I aimed for faster times, setting new PBs pretty regularly.</p><h2 class="metro-factbox-title orange trophy">                    Live your best life with Metro's parkrun partnership   </h2><p>This year Metro has partnered with the iconic charity parkrun to bring you a thriving new content series.</p><p>In a coming together of two game-changing powerhouses, Metro has been chosen as the first official media partner for parkrun as it celebrates its 20th birthday in 2024.</p><p>It's not just for the runners, though - it's for everyone.</p><p>Come with us as we embark on a series of boundary-pushing wellbeing content designed to elevate and champion, but also to support mental health and societal cohesion. Whether you run, walk, jog or strut...</p><p>Read the stories of those who have found their calling, their community or had their lives changed through the simple act of lacing up their trainers (not that you have to do parkrun in trainers...as we'll show you later on).</p><p>Get ready to be empowered, inspired, and energised!</p><p><em>Register for parkrun here. The best part is that it's free and you only need to register once. </em></p><p>Runner’s high is definitely real and I got such a buzz whenever I crossed a finish line or completed a distance in a faster time. It felt like I was winning a competition against myself!</p><p>A couple of years later in 2018, having amassed quite a collection of medals and seeking my next challenge, I signed up for a full marathon.</p><p>It took me over six hours, but I completed it, and then I did it again the following year. I shaved seven minutes off my time, though I still didn’t break the six-hour barrier.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1i4gkb_sarah_takes_a_selfie_in_a_field_with_runners_standing_behind_her.jpg" alt="Sarah takes a selfie in a field, with runners standing behind her"><figcaption><em>I was going into events with the sense that I hadn’t trained enough (Picture: Sarah McPherson). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>While this may sound like a success story, I found the more I chased PBs in races and marathons, the more I was falling out of love with running.</p><p>I found longer training sessions difficult to fit around my schedule, and struggled to motivate myself to run consistently.</p><h2 class="metro-factbox-title pink exclamation">                    Join the country's biggest running club (even if you're a walker)   </h2><p class="">Joining parkrun is free - it doesn't matter if you're a keen runner, a jogger, a walker, a social stroller or are keen to volunteer and cheer from the sidelines.</p><p class="">Register for parkrun here.</p><p class="">Did we mention it's free (tick) and you only need to do it once (tick tick).</p><p>Soon it became harder to beat my previous times and I plateaued. Then I even started to go backwards, logging personal worst race results and feeling unsatisfied with my performance. I was going into events with the sense that I hadn’t trained enough, and my times were slower than some of my first races.</p><p>When the pandemic hit in 2020, my motivation to exercise suffered even more.</p><p>Though running outdoors was allowed, I often went weeks at a time without clocking up any miles. And as races were cancelled, there wasn’t even the elusive hope of a PB for inspiration.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1i44Gc_sarah_takes_a_selfie_holding_up_a_medal_that_reads_round_sheffield_run_2022.jpg" alt="Sarah takes a selfie holding up a medal that reads 'round Sheffield run 2022'"><figcaption><em>Having amassed quite a collection of medals, I signed up for a full marathon (Picture: Sarah McPherson). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>I gained some weight, felt more unfit than ever, and my self image suffered. </p><p>As restrictions lifted I tried to find the will to get back out, but found myself making excuses – bad weather, or a long day at work – and even if I did go I’d do 2K round the block and then give up. It didn’t feel the same anymore.</p><p>Then, in early 2022, I had a minor car accident. I suffered a soft tissue injury to my lower back, which resulted in several months of pain and physiotherapy, so of course, I barely ran at all for the rest of that year. </p><p>January came around, and I was sick of the way I was feeling, so I promised myself I would get out running again. New year’s resolutions may not always work, but there is something about the start of the year that provides a bit of a boost, and that was enough for me to get my running shoes on again.</p><p>Slowly I started trying to rebuild the habit (and my fitness) and at times it was hard to come to terms with how far I had fallen.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1i44Gf_sarah_stands_in_a_field_with_runners_behind_her___on_her_top_is_a_sign_that_reads_884_sarah.jpg" alt="Sarah stands in a field, with runners behind her - on her top is a sign that reads '884 sarah'"><figcaption><em>Soon it became harder to beat my previous times and I plateaued (Picture: Sarah McPherson). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>My distances were shorter, I felt sluggish, and my pace was disappointingly slow. I was essentially starting from scratch, and it seemed like I’d never get back to where I had been before. But I told myself that didn’t matter – at least I was running.</p><p>I was getting outdoors more regularly, and spending time in the open air, running through local parks and woods. I felt more connected to the changing seasons and realised I was enjoying myself, even though I felt like a beginner again.</p><p>Suddenly, I wasn’t constantly pushing for each run to improve on the previous one, or beating myself up if I didn’t hit a particular pace. I was just running.</p><p>I set a goal in the summer of this year of completing a 10K in under 75 minutes, and felt really good when I succeeded in September.</p><p>Now, I just try to focus on putting one foot in front of the other, rather than what the timer says.</p><p>As a runner, it’s easy to get sucked into always striving for the next big PB time or race distance, and compare yourself negatively to the super-fit people at the front of the pack (or even your past self).</p><p>But I have come to realise that when I don’t put as much pressure on myself, I am happier, more motivated, and as a result, perhaps even more likely to improve simply because I’m more likely to run regularly if I’m enjoying it. </p><p>And, having been an on-and-off Parkrunner since early on in my running journey, I was interested to read about their decision to remove speed records from their website.</p><p>Statistics and data can be very motivating for some people, but Parkrun has always been about participation and inclusivity – it’s a run (or walk) not a race – so I can understand how seeing record times that feel impossible to most of us might be off putting for new participants. </p><p>If removing records helps more people get out for a weekly Parkrun without feeling pressure to perform, that can only be a good thing.</p><p>We don’t have to always push for peak performance to bring benefits, both mental and physical. In fact, studies suggest that practising self-compassion in sport can actually improve women athletes’ performance more than self-criticism.</p><p>Maybe it’s time we considered that, actually, being nice to ourselves can be far more beneficial that constantly telling ourselves we can do better. I know it’s certainly helped me.</p><p>By accepting my limitations – in that I may never run as fast or as far as I once did – I’m actually becoming a happier runner. And that’s the best PB I could ever hope for.</p></main>
