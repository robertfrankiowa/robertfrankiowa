    <main><h1>Here Are 14 Lifestyle Changes Are Recommended for Anxiety</h1><p>Anxiety is a feeling of fear, worry, or uneasiness. It can be mild or severe and range from temporary to chronic. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting nearly one-third of adults at some point in their lives.</p><p>Anxiety can affect anyone, but certain factors increase risk, including genetics and traumatic experiences. When anxiety becomes so severe that it interferes with daily life, treatment is needed to overcome it. A combination of medication and lifestyle changes are recommended for anxiety. Here are 10 lifestyle changes suggested for anxiety:</p><h2>1. Reduce Your Use of Caffeine and Alcohol</h2><p> Both caffeine and alcohol are stimulants, and they can make your anxiety worse. If you have trouble cutting back on these foods and beverages, talk to your doctor about medications or other ways to help you quit them or reduce your intake.</p><h2>2. Eat a Balanced Diet</h2><p>Eating nutritious foods and staying hydrated helps your mind and body function at their best, which can help you reduce stress and cope with challenging situations more effectively. Limit caffeine and sugar since these substances can increase anxiety.</p><figure><img title="2. Eat a Balanced Diet" src="IMG/AA1kJ3Ku_2_eat_a_balanced_diet.jpg" alt="2.

Start a Journal</h2><p>Keeping a journal is an effective way of identifying the issues that cause anxiety for you so that you can make plans to avoid them. It can also help you recognize when you’re feeling anxious so that you can take steps to calm yourself down.</p><h2>4. Practice Relaxation Techniques</h2><p>Relaxation techniques such as yoga, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness meditation can help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety by inducing relaxation. They may also help prevent them from recurring by lowering stress and helping you gain control over your feelings and emotions.</p><h2>5. Create a Bedtime Routine</h2><p> Anxiety often causes insomnia, but lack of sleep also increases anxiety, forming a vicious cycle that’s difficult to break. If you have trouble sleeping, try setting a regular bedtime schedule, practicing relaxation techniques before bed, avoiding naps during the day, turning off electronics before bed, or getting out of bed.</p><h2>6. Get Enough Sleep</h2><p> If you’re not getting enough sleep, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by stress and worry. Don’t let this happen; aim for the recommended 7-8 hours every night; if you’re having trouble falling asleep at night, try taking a warm bath or reading a book before bedtime (not on an electronic device)</p><h2>7. Don’t Smoke</h2><p>Smoking cigarettes increases anxiety sensitivity, which can heighten anxiety levels in certain people. If you’re having trouble quitting smoking on your own, ask your doctor for help. Various medications are available that can make the process easier for you.</p><h2>8. Keep Calm and Carry On</h2><p>Stressful events happen, but you don’t have to let them get the best of you. Learning how to manage your stress will help keep anxiety at bay. Be mindful of your thought patterns, and be sure to question the negative or repetitive thoughts that may be fueling your anxiety. You can also try different types of relaxing movements to help keep calm. Try yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body.</p><h2>9. Meditation</h2><p>Meditation has been shown in studies to reduce stress and anxiety by as much as 20%. It works by quieting the mind, which allows you to focus on the present moment instead of worrying about what could happen in the future or dwelling on things that occurred in the past. Try meditating for 10 minutes every day! You’ll notice an immediate difference in how you feel and react to things around you.</p><h2>10. Engage in Talk Therapy</h2><p>One of the best things you can do to help manage your anxiety is to engage in talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). CBT is a talk therapy that focuses on your thoughts and beliefs and how they influence your feelings. DBT helps people learn how to cope better with stress and regulate emotions. Psychodynamic therapy helps people understand the unconscious factors that might be contributing to their anxiety and making it worse.</p><p>These therapies are all effective when done with a licensed therapist. Some therapists will do sessions over the phone, while others will meet with you in person. The critical thing is that you work with someone who understands anxiety disorders and can help you learn how to manage them effectively.</p><h2>11. Take Medication</h2><p>Anxiety medications can ease symptoms, but they’re not suitable for everyone, and they’re not the only answer. Sometimes, the side effects of anxiety medication can be worse than the symptoms they treat. It’s a good idea to discuss all your options with a doctor before taking medication for anxiety.</p><p>Antidepressants are more commonly prescribed for anxiety than sedatives, though they take longer to work. They also take care of depression when it occurs, along with anxiety.</p><h2>12. Add Enjoyable Activity to Your Routine</h2><p> Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your body and mind. Try yoga or tai chi if more intense workouts aren’t your thing — any activity is good for anxiety!</p><h2>13. Identify Triggers</h2><p> Anxiety is a normal human response to stress. It helps individuals cope with stressful situations, such as sitting exams or making important decisions. However, people with anxiety disorders feel anxious most of the time without any apparent reason or trigger.</p><figure><img title="13. Identify Triggers" src="IMG/AA1dd9Gy_13_identify_triggers.jpg" alt="13. Identify Triggers"><figcaption><em>13. Identify Triggers.  Shutterstock. </em></figcaption></figure><h2>14. Drink More Water to Calm Anxiety</h2><p> You’ve probably been told before that drinking water is essential to being healthy. Staying hydrated has many benefits, which can help you manage your anxiety, too.</p><p>The human body is made up of around 70 percent water. Your brain contains a high percentage of water. When you get dehydrated, your brain doesn’t work as well. Staying hydrated helps the cells in the body function more efficiently, including the cells in the brain. Being well-hydrated can help you think clearly and make decisions more easily when anxious or stressed out.</p><h2>18 Startling Life Lessons Threatening Our Kids’ Futures</h2><p>Raising kids is like building IKEA furniture without a manual: all those mysterious parts and no idea where they go.
