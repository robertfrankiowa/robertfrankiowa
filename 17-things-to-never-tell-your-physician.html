    <main><h1>17 Things to Never Tell Your Physician</h1><p><p>Many people hate seeing a doctor, but it’s necessary for staying in good health. Communication is essential; if your doctor doesn’t know what’s wrong, they can’t make a correct diagnosis. However, some things are best not to mention, so below is a list of 17 things not to say to your doctor.</p><h2>A False Medical History</h2><p>Your medical history is always relevant, so you should never lie to your doctor about it. Even if you think it’s embarrassing, you should always answer any questions from your doctor honestly. Withholding vital information about your medical and surgical past could lead to a misdiagnosis, as your doctor doesn’t have all the facts.</p><h2>That You’ve Diagnosed Yourself</h2><p>When something seems wrong, Googling your symptoms is natural, but don’t attempt to diagnose yourself or tell your doctor you’ve done it. The Conversation warns that self-diagnosing can lead to anxiety, stress, and dangerous misdiagnoses, so it’s best to listen to your doctor and let them do their job.</p><h2>Anything Unreasonable</h2><p>Doctors encourage patients to be open with them and ask questions but don’t say anything unreasonable that might impact that trust and communication. Making demands will only harm your relationship with your doctor and could force them to decide not to treat you anymore.</p><h2>That You Distrust Medical Professionals</h2><p>Medical anxiety is common, but never speak down to your doctor or say that you don’t trust medical professionals. You may have had bad doctors in the past, but painting all doctors with the same brush won’t help. If you feel you can’t trust your doctor, you may need to find another one.</p><h2>That You Want Unnecessary Medication</h2><p>Some people try to take advantage of doctors by using their appointments to ask for unnecessary medication. This is inappropriate and would get the doctor into a lot of trouble, so never do it. If you think you need medication but haven’t been prescribed it, get a second opinion.</p><h2>Your Political Opinions</h2><p>Medical appointments are supposed to be 100% professional, so mentioning your political opinions to your doctor is not a good idea. Not only are they irrelevant and unnecessary, but they could make the doctor feel scrutinized or threatened. Keep the focus and conversation on your health.</p><h2>Any Lies About Your Diet or Lifestyle</h2><p>Research by the National Library of Medicine found that more than one in five people don’t disclose unhealthy diets or lack of exercise in consultations. We frequently lie about things we’re ashamed of, even to doctors. However, doctors aren’t there to judge you, so not mentioning these things will only negatively impact your communication and health.</p><h2>Any Doorknob Complaints</h2><p>Waiting until the end of your consultation to share important information is one of the most detrimental things you can do. This is known as a ‘doorknob complaint’ in the medical world. Only mentioning concerns at the end of your appointment gives your doctor no time to analyze your symptoms with the attention they require.</p><figure><img title="Any Doorknob Complaints" src="IMG/BB1p7g91_any_doorknob_complaints.jpg" alt="Any Doorknob Complaints"><figcaption><em>Any Doorknob Complaints.

Never ask your doctor to examine a friend or family member without an appointment or fabricate any prescriptions for you, because they won’t do it and might distance themselves from you to protect their credibility.</p><h2>Anything Exaggerated</h2><p>Many people worry their health concerns won’t be taken seriously, but exaggerating your symptoms is never a good idea. According to the Society of Clinical Psychology, patients who over-report symptoms cast doubt on their plausibility and are sometimes accused of faking the problem. To avoid this, try not to exaggerate when talking to your doctor.</p><h2>That You Think You Know Better</h2><p>It isn’t easy to disagree with your doctor’s opinion, but never tell them you’ve done your own research and think you know better. You’re welcome to consult other practitioners, but telling your doctor that they are wrong will come across as arrogant, harm your relationship, and lead to a risky self-diagnosis.</p><h2>Anything Rude</h2><p>While doctors try to stay professional, they have feelings, too, and won’t appreciate being spoken to rudely or disrespectfully. They’re there to help you, but they’ll part ways with patients who make it hard for them to do their jobs and make them feel uncomfortable or threatened.</p><h2>That You Just Want a Sick Note</h2><p>Nobody loves going to work every day, but never mention that you’re just trying to get a sick note. If you genuinely need one, you’ll get one, but trying to pressure a doctor into providing an unnecessary sick note won’t go down well. In fact, they might take you less seriously.</p><h2>Anything Overly Personal</h2><p>It’s great to trust your doctor but remember that the relationship is supposed to be professional. Verywell Health writes about how patients want to be able to trust, negotiate with, and share their worries with their doctor, but that this can lead them to overshare. Becoming overly personal will disrupt your professional relationship.</p><h2>That You ‘Pay Their Wages’</h2><p>It’s arrogant to tell anyone you ‘pay their wages’ because you pay taxes. You certainly won’t create a good relationship with your doctor if you speak to them that way. If you become frustrated during your appointment, it’s a good idea to step outside and cool off before you say something disrespectful like that.</p><h2>That You Understand When You Don’t</h2><p>Sometimes, your doctor will throw lots of information at you during a consultation, and it’s okay if you can’t keep up. Don’t claim that you understand everything they’ve said if you don’t, because you won’t have all the facts when managing your condition at home. Your doctor will be happy to repeat themselves.</p><h2>That You’re Fine When You’re Not</h2><p>It’s okay not to be okay, especially when speaking to your doctor. Don’t hide symptoms or pretend to be fine when you’re suffering or scared because they won’t be able to help. Doctors want to continue strengthening their relationships with patients, so always tell them how you’re really feeling.</p><figure><img title="That You’re Fine When You’re Not" src="IMG/BB1nKUFD_that_youre_fine_when_youre_not.jpg" alt="That You’re Fine When You’re Not"><figcaption><em>That You’re Fine When You’re Not.
