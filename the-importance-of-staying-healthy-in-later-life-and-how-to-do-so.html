    <main><h1>The Importance of Staying Healthy in Later Life and How to Do So</h1><p>Later life is usually defined as the stage in life when one retires from their job, which is usually in the mid to late 60s— sometimes earlier. Later life is also associated with declining health. The good news is that this isn’t always the case for everyone, but there are many age-related diseases and illnesses that can impact one’s quality of life.</p><h1>Why Is It Important to Stay Healthy in Later Life?</h1><p>There are many diseases and illnesses that are more common in later life that can dramatically impact one’s quality of life. Some of the most common health conditions associated with aging include:</p><ul> <li>Vision and hearing loss</li> <li>Osteoporosis (bone loss) and osteoarthritis </li> <li>Diabetes</li> <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li> <li>Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia</li> </ul><p>All of these diseases can require extensive care, which may require a nursing home residence. While nursing homes are skilled medical facilities that provide 24/7 care to their residents, there’s also a high occurrence of neglect and abuse in these facilities. Some of the most common occurrences include:</p><ul> <li>Bedsores</li> <li>Choking</li> <li>Dehydration and malnutrition</li> <li>Falls and dropped patients</li> <li>Wheelchair accidents</li> </ul><h1>3 Ways to Stay Healthy in Later Life</h1><p>When it comes to staying healthy in any stage of life, it’s important to focus on both physical and mental (social, emotional, cognitive, etc.) health. Here’s how you can stay healthy in later life.</p><h2>1: Eat Healthy</h2><p>Eating healthy is the number one way to avoid a variety of age-related health issues— and these health issues can also happen at an earlier age. Poor eating habits cause weight gain and weight gain tends to lead to diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and high cholesterol— all of which put extra stress on the heart. Sometimes these conditions can occur in the absence of weight gain, but the culprit is still poor eating habits. The simplest way to improve your eating is to eat less and switch out the bad for the good; for example:</p><ul> <li>Whole grains instead of refined grains and white bread</li> <li>Unsaturated fats (olive oil, avocados, etc.) instead of saturated fats</li> <li>Raw honey as a sweetener instead of sugar</li> <li>More fruits and vegetables, less processed foods</li> <li>Lean protein and fatty fish, less red meat</li> </ul><p>Some people have special dietary needs, so it’s important to consult your physician, dietician, etc. for a more accurate account of what you should be eating. Also, remember to drink plenty of water daily.</p><h2>2: Get Physically and Mentally Active</h2><p>The second most important part of maintaining a healthy weight and preventing various health conditions is to be physically active for a minimum of 150 minutes per week. This equates to 30 minutes of moderate activity five days a week, but it doesn’t mean you have to go to the gym every day. You <i>can</i> go to the gym, but you can also try:</p><ul> <li>Yoga</li> <li>Walking</li> <li>Swimming</li> <li>Pilates</li> <li>Lifting weights</li> <li>jogging/running</li> <li>Dancing</li> <li>Aerobics</li> </ul><p>While keeping your body active, it’s also important to keep your mind active as you age. This can be done by learning new skills, such as an instrument or a new language, or you can try something creative like art or writing. Spending your leisure time doing crossword puzzles and jigsaw puzzles can also help decrease your risk of developing dementia and keep your brain healthy.</p><h2>3: Stay Social</h2><p>Another part of keeping your brain healthy (mental health-wise) is by staying socially active. As we age, we tend to become more isolated, whether by choice or by circumstance. This leads to an increase in the risk of depression in older age— a mental health disorder that usually starts at a younger age.</p><p>One way to stay socially active in later life is to move into a retirement community. This allows you to be around others your age and engage in the social activities and amenities that the community has to offer. You can also get to know your neighbors in your own neighborhood and attend community events.</p><p><i>It’s never too late to put these tips into practice, but the earlier you start, the better the outcomes.</i></p></main>
