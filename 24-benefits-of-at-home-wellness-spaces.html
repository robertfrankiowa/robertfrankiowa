    <main><h1>24 Benefits of At-Home Wellness Spaces</h1><p>Wellness rooms originated in the corporate space as an escape from the open office environment. They are dedicated areas where workers can relax and take a break from their work.</p><p>At home, a wellness space is any indoor or outdoor area that can work to help you take a break from chores and focus on calm and peace. What your wellness space looks like depends on your inclinations. However, the benefits will apply to you regardless of where and how you set one up. </p><h2>1. Reduce Stress</h2><p>Having a space dedicated to making you feel good reduces stress. Include things that soothe and calm you in your dedicated area, like soft lights, a sound machine, and comfortable seating. When you intentionally sit in a space designed to reduce stress, your brain will find it easier to comply.</p><h2>2. Practice Yoga</h2><p>A wellness space is the perfect spot to practice yoga to your heart’s content, away from prying eyes. You can also store your mat and accessories in the room. Alternatively, you can make sure there’s an area where you can sit and meditate after each yoga session to reward yourself for your hard work.</p><h2>3. Heal Your Mind With Sound</h2><p>You’re the boss of your wellness area. That means you can decide what you hear when you’re enjoying your retreat. Sound machines, shown to promote relaxation and sleep and boost productivity, can help you unwind and eliminate unwanted thoughts and ruminations.</p><h2>4. Promote Exercising</h2><p>If you’re a procrastinator, it’s easy to put off burning calories by walking when you have no dedicated space or time for it. Turning your wellness space into a home gym or entering it with exercise on your mind will help you avoid procrastinating and get down to exercising, greatly improving your physical and mental health.</p><h2>5. Find Inner Peace Through Aromatherapy</h2><p>Maybe you already go to the gym daily, so exercising at home isn’t your thing. If that’s the case, turn your wellness space into a corner of paradise with aromatherapy. Pleasant smells are a good way to lighten your mood and prevent anxiety. They can also improve your sleep, appetite, and depression.</p><h2>6. Connect With Your Mind and Body</h2><p>If you’re a spiritual person, you can use your wellness space to connect with your mind and body. You don’t need any particular furniture or designs to reflect on your thoughts and listen to your body. Invest in a comfortable armchair or lounge chair and let your inner peace fill you.</p><h2>7. Have a Stress-Free Sanctuary</h2><p>While our homes should be our sanctuaries, they sometimes fail to protect us from stress and worry. When you have a wellness space, you can leave all your worries at the door and immerse yourself in relaxation. You can use a light projector with soothing lights, a white noise machine, or even your pet’s company.</p><h2>8. Create a Reading Nook</h2><p>If you’re an avid reader, having a reading nook is the best way to indulge in your favorite hobby. You don’t need a lot of space for a reading nook. Even if you only have space in an attic or a corner of your office, dedicating the space to reading will make it feel more relaxing and welcoming.</p><h2>9. Write Your Own Book</h2><p>Maybe you’re not only an avid reader but also a budding writer. In that case, sneaking a desk with your laptop and favorite writing tools into your wellness space will give you the perfect incentive to overcome writer’s block. Again, you don’t need a lot of room for this kind of space. A small unused room or even part of your garage could do the job.</p><h2>10. Practice Mindfulness With Journaling</h2><p>Journaling helps many people stay in the here and now and overcome anxiety, stress, and worries. Pouring thoughts out on paper is a great way to excise them from your head and relax. If you have a small desk in your space, you can handwrite your worries in your journal and enjoy the calm leaving them behind.</p><h2>11. Enjoy Your Hobbies</h2><p>Maybe writing, journaling, and reading aren’t your favorite hobbies. Maybe you like gardening or creating beautiful crafts or quilts to relieve stress. Your wellness space can still help you enjoy your hobbies. Set out a wellness space in your backyard if you love to be close to your flower beds. Similarly, store and play with your quilting materials in your indoor space.</p><h2>12. Stimulate Your Senses</h2><p>A wellness space isn’t necessarily a room or large area. Your bathtub can be your designated space. Likewise, a small outdoor pool can be where you relax or recharge. Make the most of using spaces like these to stimulate your senses. Have a bubble bath or carry a refreshing drink into the pool. Likewise, you can use soft, muted, or ambient lights during the day.</p><figure><img title="12.

Breathe Better With Plants</h2><p>The best way to make your wellness space welcoming is to surround yourself with plants. If your sanctuary is indoors, bring in your favorite flowers and plants. If you’re outside, you can take advantage of the fresh air and plants that naturally grow. Plants like lavender, peppermint, and aloe vera reduce stress.</p><figure><img title="13.

You can let all your worries melt away when everything surrounding you is conducive to calm and relaxation. Be mindful of your surroundings and put intent into relaxation. That way, you can enjoy your zen spot regardless of how much stress you experience daily.</p><h2>15. Cater To Your Comfort</h2><p>The typical wellness space in the corporate sector is quiet, uses muted colors, and hosts the most comfortable seating in the house. You should cater to your comfort by investing in the best ergonomics. Comfort breeds deep relaxation, and that’s what your special area is all about.</p><h2>16. Increase Relaxation With Lounging Options</h2><p>As we mentioned, comfortable seating is a must. However, you can take it one step further and, if the space allows, bring in a comfortable lounge chair, loveseat, or even a water bed. Invest in quality pillows and blankets if you need a nap in the middle of your busy day. They will help you wake up rejuvenated and ready to return to work.</p><h2>17. Harness the Power of Water</h2><p>Whether you enjoy water sounds or love to immerse yourself in a jacuzzi, water has a powerful healing effect on the mind and body. An ocean projector with wave sounds can promote well-being in a small room. A hot or cold tub in your backyard lets you benefit from water’s soothing effect on your tired muscles after a long day.</p><h2>18. Break From Work and Recharge</h2><p>Those who work from home often realize that with the boom of skipping long commutes comes the bane of inviting work stress into the heart of their home. Wellness spaces are ideal for these workers, enabling them to leave their work behind and recharge their batteries whenever they need a break.</p><figure><img title="18. Break From Work and Recharge" src="IMG/AA1foO12_18_break_from_work_and_recharge.jpg" alt="18. Break From Work and Recharge"><figcaption><em>18. Break From Work and Recharge.

If you keep your space minimalistic in its decor, you can enjoy endless versatility. A reading nook can become a mindfulness station. A quiet spot outside can quickly change to a small seating area for a couple of hours to enjoy time with friends.</p><h2>20. Fulfill Your Unique Needs</h2><p>You may need specific things to relax that other people don’t get. Nothing stops you from fulfilling your needs when you have a wellness space in your home. Unlike corporate wellness spaces, your rooms are yours to design and organize as you wish.</p><figure><img title="20. Fulfill Your Unique Needs" src="IMG/BB1iAixc_20_fulfill_your_unique_needs.jpg" alt="20. Fulfill Your Unique Needs"><figcaption><em>20. Fulfill Your Unique Needs.

Having a wellness space can improve your morale and even help prevent illness. When you use your wellness space to enjoy your well-deserved breaks from work or chores, you’re likely to be able to put a lot more effort into them later.</p><h2>22. Make the Best of an Unused Room</h2><p>You may have a room in your home that you’re unsure what to do with. Maybe you’re an empty-nester whose children’s rooms are bare. Or maybe you’ve got that attic space you’re unsure what to do with. A wellness space is the best way to use this room and improve your physical and mental health.</p><h2>23. Create Your Wellness Ritual</h2><p>A wellness ritual lets you find meaning in yourself, your environment, and being present. You can incorporate meditation and mindfulness into your ritual or close your eyes and let your senses take in your surroundings in your wellness space.</p><h2>24. Improve Your Mood During the Cold Months</h2><p>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of low mood that occurs more often during the cold, dark months of winter. We don’t know what causes it, but we can reduce its symptoms. You can use your wellness space for light therapy, using a light box to simulate exposure to sunlight and improve your mood every day.</p></main>
