    <main><h1>Studies Show Dancing Is a Great Way to Improve Your Brain Health</h1><p> [table-of-contents] stripped </p><p>Setting — and completing — a fitness goal can be amazing for both your mind and body. However, we often set unrealistic goals that are difficult to sustain for a long period of time. If your overall goal is to move more or increase the intensity of your current exercise regimen, setting specific and achievable targets can be the secret to lasting change.</p><p>The best part about fitness goals is that they don’t have to be (and shouldn’t be!) big things that require you to overhaul your routine. “The research is very clear that small improvements in physical activity can have large impacts on our physical and mental health,” says <strong>Tommy Wood, BM, BCh, PhD,</strong><strong> an assistant professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at the </strong><strong>University of Washington</strong><strong> and the co-host of </strong><strong>Better Brain Fitness Podcast</strong>. “Any increase in physical activity above and beyond what you’re doing now will be beneficial — even adding 1,000 steps to your day or joining a fitness class once a week.”</p><p class="body-tip"><em><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> You should clear any long-term changes to your fitness routine with your primary healthcare provider beforehand. </em><em>Weight loss, health and body image are complex subjects — before deciding to switch up your exercise and fitness levels, we invite you to gain a broader perspective with our exploration </em><em>into the hazards of diet culture.</em></p><p>Whether you choose to focus on a particular fitness skill or exercising more in general, the most important thing is to think about your values. “For example, if the initial goal is to ‘lose 10 pounds,’ drill down a bit deeper and ask yourself <em>why</em> that is an important goal for you,” says <strong>Jacque Crockford</strong><strong>, DHSc, an ACE Certified Personal Trainer</strong>. “Very generally speaking, weight loss goals usually have nothing to do with actually changing the weight on the scale. Doing this value assessment is essential as it will help to solidify what is important on an intrinsic level, versus chasing an external goal, which has been shown to lead to long-term behavior change, versus short-term solutions.”</p><p>Not sure where to start? Consider the expert-approved fitness goals below and remember that whatever goals you set are unique to you and need to be suited to your lifestyle. It’s also smart to consult your healthcare provider before starting any new fitness regimen.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>How to set a S.M.A.R.T. fitness goal</strong></h2><p>"Setting smart fitness goals are so important to keep you focused and accountable," says <strong>Kirsten Ferguson, Peloton Tread Instructor</strong>. Try to make each goal <strong>(S)pecific, (M)easurable, (A)chievable, (R)ealistic and (T)imely</strong>. "Far too often, people set fitness goals without a plan, with no time limit and they aren’t realistic to achieve and when they don’t happen right away, unfortunately people quit." She adds that with every goal you set, it's important that they are not only realistic but also small and manageable. Choose a goal that is meaningful to you and create a timeline to make it happen.</p><h2 class="body-h2">Realistic fitness goals</h2><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>1.Walk</strong> more </h4><p>“Often, we think that exercise has to be ‘hard’ for it to be beneficial, but a huge amount of research shows that walking is associated with improved health across the board,” says Wood. “ It requires no equipment and can have impressive health benefits.” Yes, you can walk a dog or park your car farther away from places you need to go, but Wood also likes the three strategies below for upping your step game if you have a sedentary job.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Walk during meetings</h3><p> “This could be a meeting with a colleague that you take outside rather than sitting in a meeting room, or taking a call while walking,” he says.</p><h3>Use walks to break up your day</h3><p> “Brief walks and time outdoors are a great way to improve focus and feel energized when you return to your desk,” says Wood. “If you feel yourself flagging, head for a quick walk to give yourself some time to refresh. You’d be surprised, but taking that time away from a task might help you complete it even faster!”</p><h3>Invest in a treadmill desk</h3><p>“This is not for everybody, but if you’re tied to your desk all day and can fit one into your office, a treadmill desk is an easy way to get some walking done during all those endless video calls,” says Wood.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>2. Do an elevated plank challenge</strong></h4><p>Planks are excellent moves to improve your core strength, but they’re not for everyone. “Traditional plank exercises can be really hard on your core and pelvic floor, as well as your wrists. This is especially true if you have diastasis recti," says <strong>Ashley Nowe,</strong><strong> a certified pre- and postnatal corrective exercise specialist and the founder of </strong><strong>Get Mom Strong</strong>. Diastasis rectis is a thinning of the connective tissue between your abdominals which tends to occur during pregnancy and causes your left and right abdominals to separate. “A better option for many is to add a little elevation to your plank. This makes it easier to engage your deep core muscles, and better protect your pelvic floor,” explains Nowe.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Perfect your plank</h3><p>Press your palms firmly down on a stable chair or countertop. Without letting your shoulders round, inhale through your nose and exhale out your mouth while you lift your pelvic floor and draw your tummy in and up. Hold this core engagement and use little exhales to prevent bearing down on your pelvic floor. Stay in this elevated plank position for as long as you can.</p><h3>Make it a habit</h3><p>Every other day, test how long you can hold your elevated plank for. Can you add 5 or 10 seconds? See how far you can go in 30 days.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>3. Take a class</strong></h4><p>“One of the best ways to support long-term physical health as well as brain health is to learn a new skill, especially if it’s paired with some movement,” says Wood. “Exercise classes are a perfect way to do this.” Not only do classes help you learn something new, they allow you to be part of a community of people with a similar interest. By booking a class you’re also committing yourself and blocking off time on your calendar to work out so it’s harder to back out. “The options are essentially limitless, and any class you think you might enjoy is the one you should try,” Wood adds.</p><p><strong>Fitness classes to consider:</strong></p><h3>Yoga, Pilates or tai chi</h3><p>“All of these require some balance and can improve your strength,” says Wood. “Exercise that includes balance or coordination has been shown to be particularly good for the brain.”</p><h3>CrossFit</h3><p>“Sometimes CrossFit can seem a little daunting, but CrossFit gyms can be fantastic communities of people of all ages and fitness levels,” says Wood. Of course, that’s on top of helping you build a range of fitness skills.</p><h3>Dancing</h3><p>“There are several studies showing that dancing is one of the best ways to improve both physical health and brain health,” says Wood. “Dancing incorporates all the best things about movement and exercise – music, coordination, some exertion, fun and (assuming you’re dancing with other people) an excellent sense of community and social connection!”</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>4. Complete a race</strong></h4><p>By signing up for a race like a 5K or triathlon, you’re committing to do something fitness-related within a specific time frame with other people so you may be more likely to achieve it. “With performance-related goals, it’s all about the process, taking things one day at a time,” says Crockford. “With an end goal in mind, with a date, it can make the step-by-step process feel more doable.” Plus, most races require you to pay money to register so you won’t want to lose out on that cash by skipping the race.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Select the right race</h3><p>“After you’ve done a value assessment and know why this goal is important to you, select a race you’d like to do and plan backwards from there,” says Crockford. Obviously, if you’ve never been a swimmer, you probably won’t want to jump into a triathlon. Choose a race that sounds like an enticing and fun challenge.</p><h3>Create a plan</h3><p>Add training workouts to your schedule in advance so you know you have the time blocked off and then create calendar reminders so you don’t forget about them, suggests Crockford.</p><h3>Cultivate support</h3><p>“A support system is essential for achieving goals, regardless of if they’re related to health and fitness,” says Crockford. “Tell the people in your circle — family, friends, coworkers, whomever you feel comfortable telling — and ask them to help you,” says Crockford.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>5. Do a "squat ladder"</strong></h4><p>“Squats are great for mobility, posture and, well, they help the shape of our glutes, too,” says Nowe. A fitness “ladder” is taking one particular exercise move and adding onto it every day. In this case, you would start with a number like 10 squats on the first day and then add 10 more every day for a week so by the end you’re completing 70 squats. Hello, glutes!</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Perfect your squat</h3><p>Start with feet slightly wider than your hips. Inhale as you squat down, reaching your bottom back as though you are sitting onto an imaginary chair. Aim for your thighs to be parallel to the floor and then exhale out of your mouth as you stand up, lifting your pelvic floor and drawing your belly button in and up to engage your deep core muscles. If you’re new to squats, practice squatting into a chair until you feel more comfortable.</p><h3>Build onto the move</h3><p>As you get stronger, try squatting while holding weights.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>6. Commit to three 10-minute daily movement breaks</strong></h4><p>Wood refers to these little breaks as “movement snacks.” “Recent research shows that even very brief periods of movement can add up to having a big impact on health,” he says. “Better yet, you don’t need to worry about taking the time to prepare or change your clothes — they can be spontaneous! A movement snack can be literally anything — a brief walk, taking a couple of flights of stairs or even doing a few squats, push-ups or jumping jacks next to your desk.” Not only will these little bouts of exercise benefit your physical health, Nowe points out that they’ll give you a boost of feel-good endorphins to lift your mood.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Set reminders</h3><p>Decide what times might be the easiest for you to squeeze a little movement into your day, and set a reminder on your calendar or phone so you don’t forget to stay active.”</p><h3>Pair exercise with another activity</h3><p><b>"</b>There’s a famous TED Talk where behavioral scientist BJ Fogg talks about building an exercise habit by doing push-ups every time he goes to the bathroom,” says Wood. “You can pick a different combination, but start by thinking of something you do a few times a day, like making a cup of coffee. Each time you do it, add a little movement snack right before or afterwards.</p><h3>Take the stairs</h3><p>Most people opt for the elevator or escalator, even when stairs are available. “One of the easiest ways to add a movement snack to your day is taking the stairs any time you have to change floors at home or at work,” says Wood.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>7. Incorporate weights into workouts</strong> </h4><p>Adding weight to exercise moves can increase your calorie burn and build muscles so your workouts are more efficient. That said, if you’ve never used weights before, it’s best to start using them with a fitness professional, Crockford says.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Start with machines</h3><p>With help from a pro, begin on machine-based weights (like the ones you see in a gym) once a week for 3 to 4 weeks and then progress to 2 to 3 times a week, suggests Crockford.</p><h3>Move on to free weights</h3><p>Once you have a solid foundation using machine-based weights, then Crockford says it’s fine to have a pro help you learn how to use free weights like dumbbells.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>8. Improve your bridge hold</strong></h4><p>“Bridges are one of the most beneficial exercises for women postpartum through menopause,” says Nowe. “ In fact, bridges are 56% more effective at pelvic floor activation than a kegel! Bridges work to build strong glutes, activate your corset abdominal muscles (transverse abdominis) and strengthen your pelvic floor in a gentle way.” </p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Perfect your bridge</h3><p>Lay with your back on the ground, knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Inhale while your back is on the floor, letting your breath go down into your ribs and belly. Then, take a big, audible exhale out of your mouth as you drive your heels down and lift your hips up. Continue to breathe and keep your hips lifted for a moment before slowly lowering them back down.</p><h3>Do more reps</h3><p>Once you have the bridge down, do 10 in a row and hold the last one for as long as you can.</p><h3>Make it a habit</h3><p>When you can do 10 in a row, try doing that 3 times a week for a month and see how the length of your final bridge improves.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>9. Stretch for 10 minutes every day</strong></h4><p>Flexibility varies widely from person to person, but inactivity or lack of stretching can minimize the body's range of motion. When you have limited range of motion, you may have trouble performing everyday tasks, let alone fitness moves. Lengthening and stretching muscles can also help prevent injuries and energize the body.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Stretch when you wake up</h3><p>Morning stretches can help increase blood flow to muscles and joints, preparing your body for the day ahead.</p><h3>Hold each stretch</h3><p>Aim for at least 30 seconds, which allows the muscle to fully relax. Turn on some soothing music or listen to a podcast to help pass the time by.</p><h3>Don’t skip post-workout cooldowns</h3><p>Try adding a five-minute cooldown stretching session to every workout.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>10. Prioritize recovery</strong></h4><p>"One example that doesn't get enough celebration is the fitness goal of rest and recovery," says <strong>Chelsea Jackson Roberts, Ph.D., Peloton Yoga & Meditation Instructor</strong>. "For every day or hour that you work out, try and commit to that equal amount of rest either the same day or the next." If you're starting up a new exercise regimen or performing exercise that you haven't done in a while, proper recovery is especially important because you may experience delayed onset muscle soreness. We know that exercise has a slew of health benefits, and in order to stay consistent with a workout regimen, proper recovery is essential.</p><p><strong>How to achieve it:</strong></p><h3>Go to bed 15 minutes earlier</h3><p>Sleep is your body's time to repair, recuperate and recover. Your emotional, mental and physical health all benefit from adequate sleep. If it’s hard to settle down at night, try creating a bedtime ritual that you can stick to night after night to prep your body for sleep.</p><p>Applying a foam roller to your muscles can help relieve tension and soreness while also improving your range of motion. By taking the time to foam roll, especially after a tough workout, you can help promote the recovery process. </p></main>
