This can lead to immense health issues down the line. Globally, one in four adults doesn’t achieve the recommended levels of physical activity, according to the World Health Organization, while more than 80 percent of the world’s adolescent population is insufficiently active.</p><p>Although the statistics are frightening, it doesn’t have to be that way. You can make time for this vital element in your overall well-being with a little care. Here’s how to use tech to ensure you don’t neglect your fitness goals in your busy working life.</p><h2>       1. Use a Scheduling App or Tool to Ensure You Don’t Miss a Workout     </h2><p>The first step is to schedule time in your calendar for your workout. Just as you wouldn’t miss that vital work meeting or deadline, you shouldn’t neglect your exercise time. Enter it into your device’s calendar, block out that time window so you can’t add anything else, and treat it as a “must-do” activity.</p><p>Then, allow your phone, smartwatch, or tablet to alert you when it’s time for your workout. You can use one of these apps to provide handy notifications to remind you to get up and move.</p><h2>       2. Avoid Distractions During Your Workout Time     </h2><p>Once you’ve committed your precious time to your chosen exercise activity, the next step is to ensure nothing can disturb you. It’s all too easy to take a call or read a message, and before you know it, your mind is elsewhere, and you’re not paying full attention to your workout.</p><p>Your device has help already built in. If you’re an Android user, here’s how to set up and customize Do Not Disturb on your Android device. Apple users should learn how to create a fitness focus on their iPhones.</p><p>As focus modes are customizable, you can manage who can still contact you in an emergency at these times. They can even be configured to turn on automatically whenever you start an Apple Watch workout.</p><h2>       3. Set Yourself Realistic Fitness Goals Regularly     </h2><p>You might be familiar with SMART targets from your workplace. SMART is short for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals. These factors can apply equally to your fitness goals.</p><p>The WHO recommends that adults aged 18 to 64 do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity. If you break this down into a six-day week to allow for one day’s break each week, it still means spending just 25 minutes on exercise each day.</p><p>This seems like a realistic fitness goal. And because realistic goals always seem more attainable, you’ll be more motivated to achieve them. Therefore, set a SMART fitness goal that you know will challenge you, but that you can realistically achieve in the time you have available. Then you’ll be able to work towards it more happily. Here’s how to set and reach your SMART fitness goals.</p><h2>       4. Use a Fitness Tracker     </h2><span data-embed-id="ff1259d72c9942a2b3fb5e0a5a7fdc71">                                                                                                <p>You’re much more likely to achieve your fitness goals if you measure your progress. You could use an activity tracker app such as Strava or Pedometer++ on your smartphone or the built-in tools on your device, such as Apple’s Fitness app.</p>                                                                                                                  <p>However, it’s worth investing in a fitness tracker or a smartwatch for a more detailed and accurate analysis of your progress. Whether you choose an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, or any other brand, you’ll have a better idea of how you’re progressing towards your fitness goals. A wearable will also measure your activity throughout your working day so that you’re more aware of the need to move and stay active even when you’re busy in the workplace. Here’s how to make the most of your fitness tracker.</p>                                                                                                <h2>       5.

Build opportunities for movement into your working day wherever you can, especially if you’re desk-bound for long periods.</p>                                                                                                                  <p>Use apps such as the Wakeout app to provide a short, fun activity break. And think about how technology can help you do an effective lunch break workout.</p>                                                                                                <h2>       6. Find an Accountability Partner to Keep You on Track     </h2>                                                                               <span data-embed-id="a8143ac54be14767bd6ca163c7d14abb">                                                                                                <p>One surefire way to ensure you find time to achieve your fitness goals, no matter how busy you are, is to hold yourself accountable to someone else. It’s way harder to skip your workout if you’re letting a partner, friend, or colleague down. It’s also more fun to share your exercise with others, participating in competitions or setting and completing challenges.</p>                                                                                                                  <p>Social fitness apps like Nike Run Club are a great way to stay accountable to your friends, allowing you to encourage or compete with others to meet your goals.

Many people turn to mindful movement activities to incorporate stress management with exercise. Yoga apps such as Asana Rebel offer guided routines to help relieve stress.</p>                                                                                                                  <p>Use mindful meditation to manage your stress as well.
