    <main><h1>The Best Wellness Retreats To Kick Off Your New Year</h1><h2>Mii Amo; Sedona, AZ</h2><p>A trip to this Arizona resort can be anything you want it to be. Athletes have access to a roster of classes that touches on nature walks, barre, and sunrise yoga. There's a workshop called Juicing 101 for food lovers, in addition to cooking demos and composting lessons. And if you find your center through art, you're covered: Create a vision board, decorate a gourd, or paint a watercolor postcard.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE.</em></strong></p><figure><img title="Mii Amo; Sedona, AZ" src="IMG/AA1lyApT_mii_amo_sedona_az.jpg" alt="Mii Amo; Sedona, AZ"><figcaption><em>Mii Amo; Sedona, AZ.

The popular week-long program has early wake-up calls and full daily schedules that even include naptime. The workouts are trendy —  with trampolines and kettlebells —  and the food is with-it: plant-based, gluten-free, and completely devoid of anything fun, like alcohol, caffeine, or sugar.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE.</em></strong></p><h2>Tryp Times Square South; New York City</h2><p>Amidst the hustle and bustle of Midtown Manhattan, Tryp's tiny "fitness rooms" are like mini retreats. In just 340-square-feet, each room has a king bed, a stationary bike (and exercise clothing, if you need it), hand weights, and a yoga mat. After your sweat sesh, you can order specially-created, protein-packed recovery meals, like a turkey and cranberry sandwich or grilled ahi tuna.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE.</em></strong></p><h2>Sivananda Yoga Ranch; Woodbourne, NY</h2><p>All year long, yogis flock to this Catskills resort. The program includes both the classic exercise and everything else that comes with practicing yoga. You'll eat vegetarian meals, complete Karma Yoga (an hour of selfless service, like tending to the property's gardens, every day), detoxify in the sauna, and have down time to relax. It's like the India portion of <em>Eat Pray Love</em> —  only three hours outside New York City.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE.</em></strong></p><figure><img title="Sivananda Yoga Ranch; Woodbourne, NY" src="IMG/AA1lyOcR_sivananda_yoga_ranch_woodbourne_ny.jpg" alt="Sivananda Yoga Ranch; Woodbourne, NY"><figcaption><em>Sivananda Yoga Ranch; Woodbourne, NY.

It's a massive, multi-studio space, offering spin, pilates, yoga, and personal training. If working up a sweat outdoors is more your thing, there are private tennis courts, a golf course, and a ski-in/ski-out set up. By night, the hotel restaurant serves enough clean meals (think: grilled salmon filets and tomato basil quinoa) to keep health-conscious eaters happy.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE.</em></strong></p><h2>Westglow; Blowing Rock, NC</h2><p>Westglow offers everything you never knew you needed: health food grocery store tours, aquatic exercise classes, sessions with a life coach. The resort is about healing the inside as much as it is about looking good on the outside. You can book pre-planned, multi-night programs, or reserve individual classes and treatments on top of your room fee.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE.</em></strong></p><h2>Nurture Through Nature</h2><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE</em></strong></p><figure><img title="Nurture Through Nature" src="IMG/AA1lyAqi_nurture_through_nature.jpg" alt="Nurture Through Nature"><figcaption><em>Nurture Through Nature.

There’s also a full-featured day spa, and a relaxing series of healing installations on the property like a rock labyrinth, a meditation pyramid, and a floating bed.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE</em></strong></p><h2>Rosario Resort & Spa</h2><p>If you can make it to Washington’s Orcas Island for a stay at this gorgeous resort with luxury spa amenities, you'll have the retreat of a lifetime. Not only is it beautiful, it’s a slice of history, having been built in the early-20th century by shipbuilder and Seattle mayor Robert Moran. This resort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and both guests and the public can explore the Moran Mansion if they want to learn more about the fascinating history. Their spa has a great indoor therapeutic pool, massage and skincare services from skilled practitioners. Most importantly, there is a relaxing and healing atmosphere throughout the whole place.</p><p><strong><em>BOOK A STAY HERE</em></strong></p><figure><img title="Rosario Resort & Spa" src="IMG/AA1lyJv7_rosario_resort_spa.jpg" alt="Rosario Resort & Spa"><figcaption><em>Rosario Resort & Spa.

There are fitness facilities with tons of great classes, fun programming including Haunted History Tours for the spooky months, a weekly morning hike every Saturday, and unique culinary and wellness events. Claremont Club & Spa is also very family friendly with fun kids activities making use of the facilities and beautiful outdoor locations.</p></main>
