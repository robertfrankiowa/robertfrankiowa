Several Indian actors have recently revealed their dramatic weight-loss journeys undertaken for their respective film roles. From<strong> Kartik Aaryan in Chandu Champion to Jaideep Ahlawat in Maharaj</strong>, here are some notable examples of actors who reshaped their bodies for the big screen.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kartik Aaryan</h2><p>Bollywood actor Kartik Aaryan underwent a significant weight-loss transformation for his role in the highly anticipated movie Chandu Champion, directed by Kabir Khan. The film, a biopic of Murlikant Petkar, India's first Paralympic gold medalist, required Aaryan to lose a substantial amount of body fat. </p><p>The actor participated in a rigorous 18-month boot camp and reduced his body fat from 39% to 7%. He shared on social media, "From being an insomniac to turning into a fitness enthusiast, it's surely a journey of one and half years to remember for me." This role marked a departure from his usual romantic and comedic films and involved intense physical activities such as wrestling and war sequences.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jaideep Ahlawat</h2><p>Jaideep Ahlawat’s physical transformation for Junaid Khan’s debut film, Maharaj, is another example of dedication to a role. Ahlawat shed over 26 kilograms in five months, going from 109.7 kg to 83 kg. Sharing his journey on social media, Ahlawat credited his fitness trainer, stating, “Thank you Prajwal Sir for believing in me.” His effort was in preparation for his role as Jadunath Maharaj, a character that demanded a leaner physique.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prithviraj Sukumaran</h2><p>Prithviraj Sukumaran took on an intense regimen to lose 31 kg for his role in Aadujeevitham – The Goat Life. Playing the lead character, Najeeb, Sukumaran's transformation included extreme measures such as fasting. </p><p>Cinematographer Sunil KS noted the actor’s commitment, highlighting a three-day fast where Sukumaran even avoided water on the last day. This drastic approach was to authentically depict Najeeb's physical and mental state. Sukumaran further revealed in an interview that his diet consisted mainly of water and black coffee to achieve the desired look.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bobby Deol</h2><p>For the film Animal, Bobby Deol embarked on a rigorous four-month training program under fitness expert Prajwal Shetty. Deol's goal was to achieve a more muscular and broader physique compared to his co-star, Ranbir Kapoor. </p><p>Shetty mentioned, “Bobby's physique needed to exhibit greater muscularity and size.” Deol’s body fat percentage dropped to 12% while maintaining a weight between 85 and 90 kg. His routine included high-intensity training sessions and a balanced diet tailored to increase muscle mass.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hrithik Roshan</h2><p>Hrithik Roshan's transformation for Fighter involved an extensive workout schedule and dietary plan. To achieve a shredded look for his action and dance sequences, Roshan engaged in double cardio sessions and strength training. His diet consisted of six meals a day, including proteins, fats, carbs, and fiber. Roshan also employed various recovery techniques, such as grounding, red light therapy, and ice baths, to cope with the intense training.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Randeep Hooda</h2><p>Randeep Hooda's preparation for Swatantrya Veer Savarkar saw him lose 32 kg to portray Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Hooda’s transformation was both physical and emotional, as he revealed that he almost stopped eating to achieve the desired look. Known for his dedication, Hooda had previously lost over 20 kg for his role in Sarbjit. His latest transformation further demonstrated his commitment to embodying his characters authentically.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Farhan Akhtar</h2><p>Farhan Akhtar's role in Toofan required him to undergo multiple body transformations. To play the character Aziz, Akhtar first bulked up to 85 kg by consuming around 5000 calories a day. He then leaned down to 76 kg by cutting his intake to 1200 calories daily. </p><p>All in all, these transformations highlight the dedication and effort Indian actors put into their roles, ensuring authenticity and bringing their characters to life on screen.</p></main>
