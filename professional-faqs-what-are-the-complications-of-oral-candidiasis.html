It can also result from Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei. Candida albicans, is a dimorphic fungus which exists as a commensal in the oral mucosa and vagina. The commensal becomes pathogenic in presence of predisposing factors, like moisture(in areas of occlusion like intertriginous areas and prolonged immersion in water, nail folds), obesity, diabetes and other endocrinopathies, use of broad spectrum antibiotics and metronidazole, pregnancy and oral contraceptive pills and in immunocompromised states. Oral candidiasis is the most common fungal infection in HIV positive patients, occurring in 50% of HIV positive patients and in 90% of AIDS patients. Different patterns of oral candidiasis include oral thrush, or acute pseudomembranous candidiasis, which is the common form of oral candidiasis, seen in infants and older patients who are on broad spectrum antibiotics and steroid therapy. Acute atrophic candidiasis is seen on dorsal aspect of the tongue as patchy depapillated areas. Angular stomatitis and chronic atrophic candidiasis is usually seen in denture wearers. Candidal leukoplakia presents as rough white plaques on buccal mucosa or tongue, it has pre malignant potential. Although unlikely in an immunocompetent host, oral candidiasis can lead to pharyngeal involvement, causing dysphagia and respiratory distress. A significant concern for immunocompromised patients is the systemic dissemination of the disease. Candidal esophagitis is a particularly common complication of oral candidiasis in those with HIV or AIDS.</p><p><p>→ <b>Learn more about oral candidiasis: See the causes, symptoms, treatment options and more.</b></p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to oral candidiasis.</b></p><h2>Expert opinion from Marcelle Freire</h2><h5>Doctor of Medicine · 3 years of experience · Brazil</h5><p>Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida fungi. Oral candidiasis is more common in the extremes of age and in immunocompromised patients. A part of patients with candidiasis of the oral cavity do not develop symptoms, but some patients may complain of pain when swallowing, reduced taste and sensation of cotton in the mouth. It usually does not cause major complications although, in some cases, it can mean a significant compromise of the patient's immune system (either by drugs or by diseases such as neoplasia, HIV or diabetes).</p><h2>Expert opinion from Hariteja A</h2><h5>MBBS · 4 years of experience · India</h5><p>For people with lowered immunity, such as from cancer treatment or HIV/AIDS, oral candidiasis can be more serious. Untreated oral candidiasis can lead to more-serious systemic candida infections. If you have a weakened immune system, candidiasis may spread to your esophagus or other parts of your body. The fungus that causes candidiasis may enter your bloodstream and spread to your heart, brain, eyes, or other body parts.</p><p><p>→ <b>Learn more about oral candidiasis: See the causes, symptoms, treatment options and more.</b></p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to oral candidiasis.</b></p><p><table><tr><th>What are people curious about?</th></tr><tr><td>Shingles vaccine</td><td>Shingles</td></tr><tr><td>Non biologic treatment for crohn's disease</td><td>Stem cell treatment for crohn's disease</td></tr></table></main>
