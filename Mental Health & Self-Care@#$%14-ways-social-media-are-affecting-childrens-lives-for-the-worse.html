    <main><h1>14 Ways Social Media Are Affecting Children's Lives For The Worse</h1><h2>Comparison</h2><p>With so many influencers constantly showing stunning pictures of their bodies and amazing holidays, it’s hard not to compare our situation with theirs. For kids, this may be even more challenging as, unlike us, they may not always be aware that not all of what they see is real. </p><figure><img title="Comparison" src="IMG/BB1mhtPT_comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison"><figcaption><em>Comparison.

Whenever they scroll through their social media, they are constantly reminded that someone out there is living the best possible life, and they are not. </p><h2>Isolation</h2><p>Unfortunately, social media is often associated with isolation among teens. Despite being known for connecting people, these platforms rarely keep their promises. While teens may be able to digitally connect with their friends through photos and posts, real-life connections are often jeopardized. </p><h2>Unrealistic Standards</h2><p>Social media is also responsible for setting unrealistic standards to which young teens regularly compare themselves. Photos on social media are often modified to obtain the perfect body image, and only in recent years has it become common to show body imperfections.</p><h2>Perceived Isolation</h2><p>Apart from isolation, social media are also responsible for perceived isolation. For instance, your kid may have a great group of friends with whom he often hangs out. However, he may think his socialization is lacking compared to the many pictures of people joining parties and cool events on social media. </p><h2>Sleep Deprivation</h2><p>Social media usage has also been linked to poor sleep quality, making your kid feel tired throughout the day. A good way to avoid this is by setting limits on when your children are allowed to use their phones, such as introducing a rule prohibiting screen time after a certain hour.</p><figure><img title="Sleep Deprivation" src="IMG/BB1mFEea_sleep_deprivation.jpg" alt="Sleep Deprivation"><figcaption><em>Sleep Deprivation.

Using these platforms activates the reward centers of our brain linked to other pleasurable activities, such as eating sugar or having sex, leading to an addiction. </p><figure><img title="Dopamine Boost" src="IMG/BB1lzzPN_dopamine_boost.jpg" alt="Dopamine Boost"><figcaption><em>Dopamine Boost.

Even though some platforms are trying to find these trends, plenty of users still promote unhealthy diets and habits leading to eating disorders, such as anorexia.</p><figure><img title="Eating Disorders" src="IMG/BB1nl3wG_eating_disorders.jpg" alt="Eating Disorders"><figcaption><em>Eating Disorders.

Rather than focusing on achievements and personal goals, young teens are now prone to associate their idea of success with the number of followers and likes they get on these platforms. </p><h2>Cyberbullying</h2><p>Cyberbullying is defined as the use of technology to threaten, harass, or embarrass people. Unfortunately, it is incredibly difficult to prevent this type of bullying from happening, as parents and teachers are often unaware of it. Despite this, cyberbullying can have terrible consequences for kids, impacting their psychological well-being. </p><h2>Attention Span</h2><p>Social media also negatively affects our ability to focus for prolonged periods. No wonder why videos are becoming shorter and shorter. This means that kids are now struggling more than ever to pay attention in class. </p><h2>Information Overload</h2><p>This problem affects all sorts of generations. To understand what it means, think of a typical night at home trying to choose something to watch on Netflix. It often takes us hours of scrolling to find something, and more often than not, we end up watching nothing. Nowadays, kids have access to too much information, leading to general indecisiveness affecting all aspects of their lives.</p><h2>Reduced Productivity</h2><p>Social media can also have drastic consequences for kids’ productivity. Just think how difficult it is to concentrate on a task when your phone keeps beeping to inform you you received yet another notification. If it’s hard for you, imagine how difficult it is for kids.</p><h2>More for You</h2><p>Raising kids is not easy, and social media has surely made everything more challenging. However, there is no need to despair. With the right tips and tricks, you can still raise happy and fulfilled children. Here are a few life lessons I decided to teach my daughters before they turn 13. </p></main>
