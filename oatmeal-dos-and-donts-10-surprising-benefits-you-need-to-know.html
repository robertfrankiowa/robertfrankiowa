    <main><h1>Oatmeal Dos and Don’ts: 10 Surprising Benefits You Need to Know</h1><p>Oats are globally recognized as a health food. Half a cup contains 4g of fiber, known as beta-glucan, which regulates cholesterol. Oats are low in calories but balanced in protein, fats, and fiber, making them a wholesome meal. But what is the correct way to consume oats? Here are ten things to keep in mind when eating oats.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eating too much</h2><p>Due to its many health benefits, people often consume oatmeal in large quantities. However, excessive consumption can result in a calorie bomb, so caution is advised. The standard oatmeal recipe typically uses half a cup of dry oats per serving, which amounts to 150 calories. Adding another 150 calories for toppings makes for a reasonable calorie intake.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eating packaged food</h2><p>With oats’ popularity soaring, fast-food restaurants are introducing oat-based products. Oats are easy to make and convey a health-conscious image. However, before purchasing oats at a fast-food restaurant, it is advisable to check the ingredients list. While some health food stores may add healthy ingredients, they can also add unnecessary ones.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adding too much sugar</h2><p>People often add brown sugar or chocolate chips to enhance sweetness when preparing an oat-based meal. However, increasing the sweetness can harm your health and negate the purpose of eating oats. It is recommended that sweeteners be replaced with healthy additives like cinnamon or unsweetened cocoa powder.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Piling on dried fruits</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1oHexr_oatmeal_dos_and_donts_10_surprising_benefits_you_need_to_know.jpg" alt="Oatmeal Dos and Don’ts: 10 Surprising Benefits You Need to Know"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many people make the mistake of adding dried fruits when eating oatmeal. While most people think fruits are low in calories, it’s a different story with dried fruits. Unlike fresh fruits, dried fruits have a higher sugar content as all the water has been removed. Fresh or frozen fruits are preferable to dried fruits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adding vegetables</h2><p>Artificial sweeteners are preferable to sugar for sweetening meals. Nevertheless, research suggests that artificial sweeteners lead to more carbohydrate and sugar intake and deplete healthy gut bacteria. Incorporating vegetables like carrots or pumpkins can increase fiber content and create a savory oatmeal dish.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not adding enough protein</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1oHqdV_oatmeal_dos_and_donts_10_surprising_benefits_you_need_to_know.jpg" alt="Oatmeal Dos and Don’ts: 10 Surprising Benefits You Need to Know"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Relying solely on oatmeal for dieting may not curb your hunger, potentially leading to overeating later. Protein is essential for a feeling of fullness. Adding protein to fresh fruits, nuts, or nut butter is advisable. Mixing in milk, yogurt, or protein powder is also a method.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cooking blandly</h2><p>As various recipes using oats emerge, try them. Oats are commonly used in rice or processed into oatmeal. Oatmeal is a coarser, slightly beige powder made from oats. Its powder can be added to milk and eaten like cereal or used as an ingredient in cookies or bread.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Regulating intake</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1oHgXh_oatmeal_dos_and_donts_10_surprising_benefits_you_need_to_know.jpg" alt="Oatmeal Dos and Don’ts: 10 Surprising Benefits You Need to Know"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Oats can improve bowel movements and remove hangovers. However, if consumed excessively, they can also cause digestive problems such as stomach pain and diarrhea. Therefore, it’s best to consume them only as a meal replacement once a day. Especially for those with sensitive intestines, it’s advisable to consume oats for lunch or dinner rather than on an empty stomach in the morning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Neglecting fats</h2><p>Reducing fat, not muscle, is key to a healthy diet. Beta-glucan, a soluble dietary fiber in oats, absorbs body fat and excretes it during bowel movements. It’s also important to add healthy fats. Consume nuts, nut butter, chia, flax, and seeds.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ignoring rolled and cut oats</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1oHjw2_oatmeal_dos_and_donts_10_surprising_benefits_you_need_to_know.jpg" alt="Oatmeal Dos and Don’ts: 10 Surprising Benefits You Need to Know"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rolled oats undergo hulling, steaming, flattening, and lightly toasting before drying. Cut oats, on the other hand, are hulled oats cut into two or three pieces. Choose less processed products like rolled oats and steel-cut oats over instant products. Steel-cut oats absorb more water than instant products, so you’ll feel much fuller even if you eat less.</p></main>
