One very important part of the body that can benefit from blueberries is the brain.</p><p>Harvard nutritional psychiatrist Uma Naidoo <b>considers this fruit the number one food, which she doesn’t go a morning without eating. </b>She says there are so many options in choosing foods that should make up part of our daily diet, but the most beneficial when it comes to helping your brain age well is the blueberry. For her, <b>they are “versatile, accessible and absolutely scrumptious.”</b></p><p><i><b>READ ALSO: </b></i><i><b>The most hydrating fruit for a hot day</b></i></p><h2>Why are blueberries the best brain food?</h2><p>These berries are very <b>rich in flavonoids</b>, which are a group of plant chemical nutrients found in fruits and vegetables. Studies have found that these compounds can reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. People who eat a diet that includes at least<b> half a daily serving of foods high in flavonoids may have a 20% lower risk of cognitive decline,</b> according to a 2021 Neurology Journal study. <b>Also, blueberries help blood flow to the brain, thus lowering the risk of vascular dementia. </b>The addition of this fruit to one’s diet has been<b> found to help in </b><b>Alzheimer’s therapy</b><b>.</b></p><p>Like other phytonutrients, flavonoids are high in antioxidants. <b>The antioxidants in blueberries- anthocyanins which give these berries their characteristic color- have anti-aging properties. </b>They fight anti-inflammation and oxidative stress. These negative effects occur when unstable molecules or free radicals damage cells. Blueberries<b> help fight these harmful effects</b>, reducing the risk of developing chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Thanks to the fiber they contain, the berries facilitate digestion and improve intestinal health. Also, due to the high content of phytosterols - food factors that reduce cholesterol absorption in the intestine - <b>they can reduce cholesterol levels that would otherwise clog arteries. </b>This, in turn, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p><i><b>READ ALSO: </b></i><i><b>The super fruit for lowering cholesterol and preventing hair loss</b></i></p><h2>Other benefits of the blueberry: from eyesight to urinary tract infections</h2><p>These small berries also benefit our vision: <b>they prevent cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinitis.</b></p><p>As a consequence of the organic acids present in this fruit, the acidity in urine increases, <b>preventing the proliferation of bacteria and urinary tract infections.</b></p><p>Blueberries are therefore a smart addition to any diet due to their exceptional nutritional profile. On top of all the goodness previously mentioned, they have potassium, vitamin K, vitamin C and folate. <b>Nutritionists recommend consuming between half a cup to a cup per day as part of a balanced diet.</b> You can eat this fruit from the freezer too: as long as there are no added sugars, juice or preservatives, frozen blueberries will give you the same nutritional benefits as their fresh counterparts.</p></main>
