    <main><h1>How to Step Into Your Wellness Era, According to a Fitness Pro</h1><p><em>Ad in partnership with Walmart — Save money. Live better.</em></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Jump To:</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-center"> What Is a Wellness Era <strong>|</strong> How to Enter Your Wellness Era <strong>|</strong> Beginner Workout <strong>|</strong> Walmart Picks </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">First — <strong>What Does Entering an Era Mean?</strong></h2><p>Even if you’re not perpetually online, you’ve likely heard someone say “I’m entering my…era.” The phrase is meant to signify that you’re stepping into a new chapter of your life, whether it’s something cheeky like people pleasers stepping into their “villain era” by simply setting respectful boundaries or a parent-to-be entering their “mom era.”</p><p>On the surface, it might sound like a silly internet fad — and, yes, admittedly, entering your “country era” is a bit niche — but other eras, like entering your “wellness era” are empowering and promote positive changes. Some might even argue that claiming your new era is an act of manifestation in and of itself! </p><p>But like the practice of manifestation, speaking something into the ether doesn’t just make it yours — you also need to take meaningful action to claim it. Which is why we teamed up with personal trainer and content creator Imneet Kaur to teach us how we can all enter our wellness era with the help of Walmart.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is a Wellness Era?</strong></h2><p>While wellness can sometimes be associated with unattainable goals and strict diets, the actual definition of wellness speaks to something different. The National Institute of Health defines wellness as “holistic integration of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, fueling the body, engaging the mind, and nurturing the spirit.” And Imneet agrees. </p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p>“To me, wellness means that I can be selfish with myself, choose myself and use that time to improve any little aspect of my life — whether its fitness, mental health or nutrition. It means being a better you.”</p> Imneet Kaur</blockquote><p>In other words, to enter your “wellness era” you’re committing yourself to a journey towards better physical health and mental wellbeing. This has nothing to do with a number on the scale or physical aesthetic. Instead, it’s about honing in on the daily routines that make you feel your best. </p><p>For some, that might be avoiding foods that make them feel sluggish and off their game. For others, that might be incorporating more mindful movement like a daily walk or a morning stretch — or taking it up a notch in the gym. For all of us, it could probably be drinking a bit more water and getting a bit more sleep. The ultimate goal is to consistently feel more aligned and at peace in your body — so, how do you achieve this?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Enter Your Wellness Era</strong></h2><p>Entering an era sounds intense and life changing, but the real way to promote positive change is to start slow. For Inmeet, a day of wellness might look getting up early, journaling and meditating, having coffee and a big breakfast, getting in a workout, doing some work and ending the night by turning off her phone and reading with some tea and enjoying some chocolate. For a beginner, it will likely look completely different. </p><p>Inmeet suggests taking it easy on yourself and releasing any pressure to be perfect from the jump. Instead of heading to the gym right away, where you may feel inexperienced or overwhelmed, start with an online video or pull up your favorite influencer and get some ideas for at-home work outs. Instead of eating clean 100% of the time, try a new recipe that incorporates more vegetables. Instead of a 10-minute meditation, do breath work for one minute. </p><p>Inmeet also notes that being well means being happy and content with where you are in life. It’s about feeling comfortable and confident with your body, yes, but also about surrounding yourself with inspiration that makes you feel inspired. She hits home by saying that being well is about making a lifestyle change and not a quick fix. The goal is to make this a daily routine. It’s holistic, she says. </p><p>For fitness beginners, try Imneet’s 5 minute at-home workout. You can even take it up a notch by adding in the weighted vest from Walmart, featured below.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Real Deal by RetailMeNot" src="IMG/BB1kHsCv_how_to_step_into_your_wellness_era_according_to_a_fitness_pro.jpg" alt="How to Step Into Your Wellness Era, According to a Fitness Pro"><figcaption><em>Image: Renee Smith.

To prove that, we had Imneet try out some products from Walmart and share her thoughts. Check out her Walmart selects below.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Reebok Ultra-Grip Ab Wheel & Knee Pad</h3><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Reebok Sliding Core Discs</h3><figure><img title="Provided by The Real Deal by RetailMeNot" src="IMG/BB1kHJe8_reebok_sliding_core_discs.jpg" alt="Reebok Sliding Core Discs"><figcaption><em>Image: Walmart. Provided by The Real Deal by RetailMeNot</em></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of affordable and compact workout tools, these sliding core discs are perfect for adding a bit of instability into your workout routine. Use them on hardwood or carpeted floor to perform push ups, lunges or squats to improve strength, flexibility and your range of motion. Imneet used them for planks and lunges, where she said she felt a great stretch in her inner thighs.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Reebok Weighted 20-Pound Vest</h3><p>You don’t need a fully equipped gym to up your weight class. Just add on this 20-pound vest to your normal workout circuit to increase the difficulty level. It has a breathable mesh back, adjustable straps and is made of sweat-wicking fabric so you stay cool and dry. It also has reflective elements so you can wear it outdoors at night or in the early morning. Imneet did a squat to pull-up workout with the vest on and said it definitely helped to turn up the intensity. Looking for an even bigger burn? Try the 40-pound vest instead.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">ARVAKOR Bike</h3><p>Movement doesn’t need to be all squats and push ups, heading outdoors and biking around your neighborhood is also a great way to get your heart rate up and calm your mind. This adorable retro-inspired bike is made of high-carbon steel for long-lasting durability and has a cute basket to store your belongings. Imneet gushes that the bike is “gorgeous” in real life.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Walmart?</h2><p>There may be other retailers out there that might support your wellness era journey, but Walmart is our top pick. The retailer not only has a wide assortment of trusted brands and products, but it also is known for its always-low prices. Walmart’s Deals section, for example, is brimming with over 1,000 discounted items in every category, including wellness and personal care and sports and outdoors. For even steeper savings, check out the Flash Deals section, which slashes prices (up to 65% off) weekly. </p><p>Inmeet agrees, saying she loves how accessible and convenient shopping at Walmart is and that they have great prices. She also jokes that she feels like she grew up at Walmart, spending every weekend shopping there with her mom. “When I was younger I used to walk around the workout gear aisle — not the toy aisle,” she laughs.</p><p>Not only is shopping in-person at Walmart easy, Walmart also has the most convenient options for getting your purchase to your door. You can buy online and pick up select items in-store the same day — or opt for free two-day shipping so you never even have to leave your house. Some items are even available for same-day delivery to get you what you need fast.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More About Imneet</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Real Deal by RetailMeNot" src="IMG/BB1kHEhi_how_to_step_into_your_wellness_era_according_to_a_fitness_pro.jpg" alt="How to Step Into Your Wellness Era, According to a Fitness Pro"><figcaption><em>Image: Imneet Kaur. Provided by The Real Deal by RetailMeNot</em></figcaption></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">RMN: Tell us a bit about yourself!</h4><p>I live in Long Beach, California and I’ve been a Barry’s Bootcamp instructor for about two years now, which I love. It’s a 50-minute class that focuses cardio and weight training and the community is really great. I also work full time as a content creator — I studied graphic design in college and I feel like this is an outlet to persue a creative venture. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">RMN: How did you get into fitness and training?</h4><p>I’ve been an athlete my whole life — I played volleyball and soccer in high school — and in college I wanted to stay fit and active so I got into weight training which led me to train with a coach and eventually become certified in personal training myself!</p><p>I’m seeing a lot of people ditching restrictive diets and programs and going towards living a more healthy lifestyle. They’re eating for fuel, not for aesthetics. I also see a lot of people getting into hybrid training, trying out a combination of different disciplines. Pilates and running are also huge right now.</p></main>
