    <main><h1>Can Oatmeal Help You Lose Weight?</h1><p>Starting a cozy autumn morning with a warm bowl of oatmeal not only embraces the season's coziness but also ushers in a host of nutritional benefits. Packed with dietary fiber, essential vitamins, and minerals, oatmeal has numerous benefits, which is why it's often touted by many as a powerful tool in the pursuit of a healthy diet—but can the same be said for weight loss?</p><p>We spoke with <strong>Amy Goodson, MS, RD, CSSD, LD</strong>, a registered dietitian and certified specialist in sports dietetics who sits on our Medical Expert Board, who says that the answer to the question of whether eating oatmeal can help you lose weight is a resounding "Yes."</p><p>"Oatmeal [is] heart healthy because it is rich in soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucans, which can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in the blood," Goodson explains. "The soluble fiber in oatmeal can also help regulate blood sugar levels by slowing down the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream. Plus, oatmeal's fiber content promotes healthy digestion by preventing constipation and supporting a well-functioning gastrointestinal system."</p><p>If you didn't already know, getting a sufficient fill of fiber is a crucial part of successful weight loss. And as Goodson points out, oatmeal is chock-full of it.</p><p>Now that we've established oatmeal can be an excellent addition to your diet, let's get into five ways oatmeal can help you lose weight, according to Goodson.

Oatmeal can help you feel full</h2><p>Eating a hearty bowl of oats for breakfast is a surefire way to feel full and satisfied, as oatmeal offers plenty of fiber. Fiber can aid in weight management by lowering the total amount of calories you consume. "Fiber helps you feel full faster and stay full longer, which can also help curb unhealthy snacking between meals," Goodson tells us.</p><figure><img title="1.

In fact, complex carbs can aid in your weight loss efforts. "Oatmeal is a good source of complex carbohydrates, providing a steady release of energy because it digests slower," Goodson explains. "It can help you stay energized throughout the day and maintain stable blood sugar levels. This can help you fight off cravings and excessive snacking between meals that often leads to weight gain over time."</p><figure><img title="2.

It’s packed with protein.</h2><p>In addition to fiber, protein is another golden piece of the weight loss pie you should be sure to get enough of. "With just about five grams of protein in a half-cup of oats (measured dry), it can help you feel full faster and stay full longer after meals," says Goodson. "Plus, oats are a great base for other high-protein foods like nuts and nut butters, seeds, milk, and protein powder. All of these additions can be used to amp up a bowl of oatmeal into a protein powerhouse!"</p><figure><img title="3.

It doesn’t come with a high calorie count.</h2><p>When you have a goal of losing weight, you're likely searching for low-calorie foods that actually taste good. After all, weight loss is all about establishing a calorie deficit each day. Oatmeal fits the bill.</p><p>"Oats are low in calories," Goodson points out. "With only 150 calories for a half-cup serving (measured dry), they boast of nutrients like fiber and protein that help you stay full longer than if you were eating 150 calories from a pastry or breakfast baked good. This can help create a stable blood sugar first thing in the morning so that you can then proactively eat balanced throughout the day."</p><figure><img title="4.

It’s versatile.</h2><p>One of the most helpful and effective tips when it comes to weight loss is choosing foods that can seamlessly be added to different meals and snacks. The versatility of oats can't be denied.</p><p>"Oats can be used in a variety of recipes, from traditional breakfast oatmeal to smoothies, muffins, and energy bites, as well as incorporated into savory dishes like using them as the base of risotto instead of rice or a topping instead of breadcrumbs," Goodson explains.</p><p>Your diet doesn't have to be boring; it can be creative and fun!</p></main>
