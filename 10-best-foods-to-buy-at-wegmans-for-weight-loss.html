    <main><h1>10 Best Foods To Buy at Wegmans for Weight Loss</h1><p>When you're looking to lose weight and implement healthier lifestyle habits into your routine, an excellent place to start is with your shopping list. If you're a Wegmans shopper, we chatted with <strong>Lisa Young, Ph.D., RDN</strong>, the author of <em>Finally Full, Finally Slim</em>, a nutritionist in private practice, and a member of our Medical Expert Board, who shares key aspects to be mindful of on your next grocery store run. With Young's feedback, we've rounded up 10 of the best foods to buy at Wegmans for weight loss.</p><p>Before you head to the store, though, let's review some of Young's tips.</p><p><ol><p>  <li><strong>Be mindful of ingredients.</strong> When grocery shopping with weight loss in mind, ingredients and nutrition labels should be at the top of your mind. "Look for products that have little or no added sugars, as they contribute to weight gain. Consumption of added sugars also increases hunger and cravings which can lead to overeating," Young stresses.</li><p>  <li><strong>Choose high-fiber foods.</strong> Fiber keeps you feeling full and satisfied long after you finish a meal, so be sure to add items that have a high-fiber content to your cart. This includes fresh fruits and veggies and whole grains.</li><p>  <li><strong>Consider the calorie count.</strong> "Calories of food items may be beneficial to consider when trying to manage weight," Young says. "[For example,] don't opt for food products with high calories per serving (300 calories and above). Excess calorie intake will be stored as fat leading to weight gain, to lose weight it is important to burn more calories than you consume."</li><p>  <li><strong>Nix foods that are high in sodium.</strong> Food items with a high sodium content could negatively impact your weight loss progress. "Many high-sodium foods are processed and tend to have little to no nutritional value," Young says.</li><p>  <li><strong>Choose whole, unprocessed foods.</strong> Foods like lean proteins, veggies, fruits, and whole grains are excellent examples of whole foods. "Consumption of lean protein is beneficial for weight loss, as it promotes satiety compared to fats or carbohydrates," Young tells us. "Protein is [also] essential for weight loss, as it still maintains lean muscle mass throughout the weight loss process. [In addition, it] provides essential nutrients to enhance bodily functions."</li></ol><p>Now, without delay, get ready to give your shopping list a major update.
