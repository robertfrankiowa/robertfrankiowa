    <main><h1>Sinus Infection and Tooth Pain: What’s the Connection?</h1><p>Also Known as a “Sinus Toothache”</p><strong>Medically reviewed by Brian T. Luong, DMD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Brian T. Luong, DMD</strong><p>A sinus infection, also known as sinusitis, is a condition in which mucus builds up within the sinuses, providing an ideal growing environment for bacteria and germs. A sinus infection can cause a series of symptoms, including tooth pain.</p><p>This article will discuss why a sinus infection causes tooth pain, other sinus infection symptoms, and treatment. It will also cover when to contact a healthcare provider.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1mVzUF_person_holding_jaw.jpg" alt="person holding jaw"><figcaption><em>South_agency / Getty Images.

There are four types of sinuses, which are connected by small passages. Below is a list of each type and its location:</p><ul><li><strong>Maxillary sinuses</strong>: Under the eyes</li><li><strong>Frontal sinuses</strong>: Above the eyes</li><li><strong>Ethmoid sinuses</strong>: Between the nose and eyes</li><li><strong>Sphenoid sinuses</strong>: Behind the nose and between the eyes</li></ul><p>The sinuses are lined with cells that produce mucus to prevent them from drying out. The mucus helps to keep the nose and sinuses clear of bacteria and other germs to prevent illness.</p><h2>Can a Sinus Infection Cause Tooth Pain?</h2><p>Yes, a sinus infection can cause tooth pain for two reasons.</p><p>The maxillary sinuses are located in the cheekbones, above the upper teeth. When these sinuses are inflamed from an infection, pain can be felt in the nearby teeth, usually the upper molars. The pain can worsen when bending over or changing head position.</p><p>Another reason a sinus infection causes tooth pain is from pressure on the nerves that go to the teeth.</p><p>Tooth pain caused by a tooth injury or decay is generally felt in only the affected tooth. Whereas, sinus infection tooth pain is felt in multiple teeth.</p><h2>Can a Dental Infection Cause a Sinus Infection?</h2><p>A dental infection can cause a sinus infection. In fact, 40% of sinus infections are thought to have started as a dental infection.</p><p>A dental infection caused by tooth decay can cause a maxillary sinus infection, which is called maxillary sinusitis of dental origin (MSDO).</p><p>A tooth infection can lead to a sinus infection, which is called odontogenic sinusitis. The infection may stem from an abscess or trauma in the maxillary teeth. It will then spread from the teeth to the sinuses.</p><h2>Sinus Toothache vs. Regular Toothache</h2><p>A sinus toothache can be difficult to distinguish from other types of toothaches. One primary difference is that a sinus toothache will affect several teeth and generally affects the upper molars. This is due to the proximity of the maxillary sinuses' to the upper molars. Other symptoms of sinus infection will also accompany a sinus toothache.</p><p>Regular toothaches from tooth decay are typically felt only in the affected tooth. The pain tends to be described as sharp and may be precipitated by eating or drinking something cold or hot.</p><h2>Other Symptoms of Sinusitis</h2><p>Sinusitis usually starts as a cold. Besides tooth pain, sinusitis can cause several symptoms. The symptoms of a sinus infection include:</p><ul><li>Fever</li><li>Weakness</li><li>Cough</li><li>Congestion</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Postnasal drip</li></ul><h2>How a Sinus Infection Is Treated</h2><p>A sinus infection can be caused by bacteria or viral infection. Treatment often starts with home remedies that focus on clearing congestion and improving any discomfort.</p><h3>Home Remedies</h3><p>Most of the time, sinus infections can be treated with at-home remedies. The remedies listed below are ways to help loosen up mucus and clear out the sinuses:</p><ul><li>Breathe in steam from a warm bowl or water from the shower</li><li>Over-the-counter (OTC) decongestants</li><li>Saline nasal spray</li><li>Warm compress on the head and sinuses</li></ul><p>A healthcare provider may decide to treat a sinus infection with antibiotics. This is only used when the healthcare provider suspects that the underlying cause is a bacterial infection.</p><p>Antibiotics do not treat viral infections, which are the primary cause of sinus infections.</p><p>Sometimes, a healthcare provider may recommend delayed antibiotic prescribing or watchful waiting.</p><p>Delayed antibiotic prescribing is when the provider prescribes the antibiotic but suggests waiting two to three days before filling the prescription. This is to see if the person gets better and may not need antibiotics.</p><p>Watchful waiting is just as it sounds. Your healthcare provider will suggest waiting two to three days to determine if antibiotics are needed. This gives the body a couple of days to get better before prescribing an antibiotic.</p><h2>How to Relieve Tooth Pain From Sinus Pressure</h2><p>There are several ways to help relieve tooth pain caused by sinus pressure. The primary goal should be to alleviate congestion in the sinuses, which can be done using the methods and treatments described above.</p><p>Another treatment option to reduce the pain is to take an OTC anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen. This will help reduce swelling and pain, which can minimize tooth pain.</p><h2>How Long Does a Sinus Toothache Last?</h2><p>It is difficult to know how long a sinus toothache will last. An acute sinus infection can last anywhere from 10 days to eight weeks. A sinus toothache should go away when the sinus infection resolves.</p><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>A sinus infection is generally not a serious medical condition. However, there are certain circumstances when someone should contact their healthcare provider.</p><ul><li>Symptoms do not improve after 10 days</li><li>Fever for more than three to four days</li><li>Symptoms get better but then worsen</li><li>Severe symptoms like severe headaches or face pain</li><li>Several sinus infections within a year</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>A sinus infection can cause tooth pain when mucus builds up in the sinuses. This mucus buildup puts pressure on teeth and can press on nerves that go to the teeth. A sinus infection can be treated with home remedies like decongestants but may need to be treated with antibiotics prescribed by a healthcare provider.</p></main>
