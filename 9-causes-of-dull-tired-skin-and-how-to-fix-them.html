Having that natural, lit-from-within glow doesn't just look nice — it is also a sign of healthy, balanced skin. If your skin is luminous, it often means that you have a healthy skin barrier, good cell turnover and well-moisturized skin. If your skin is dull, though, it could be a sign that your skin is not in its best (or healthiest) shape.</p><p class="body-text">But not to worry: There are tons of simple ways to bring that luminosity back to your skin. Between skincare products, professional treatments and natural options, there are plenty of solutions that work instantly and over time. Ahead, we've rounded up the top nine reasons why your skin may be dull and how to easily treat each cause, so you can rejuvenate and brighten dull, tired skin in no time. </p><h2 class="body-h2">1. The Cause: You're forgetting to moisturize regularly.</h2><p>If you're dealing with dryness on your face, you're not the only one. It is also one of the most common causes of dull skin, as it creates cracks in the skin's surface and causes dead skin cells to build up, making the complexion look uneven and lackluster, says Kenneth Howe, M.D., a dermatologist at UnionDerm in New York City.</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>The Best Treatment:</strong></h4><p class="body-text">Applying a face moisturizer twice a day (every morning and night) brings moisture and hydration to the skin, which helps improve elasticity and protect your skin's barrier. Look for moisturizers with ingredients like ceramides to help repair skin barrier function and improve water retention and hyaluronic acid, which plumps skin cells by attracting water, advises Melanie Palm, M.D., a dermatologist and the director of Art of Skin MD in Solana Beach, California. (GH Beauty Lab test winner CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion contains both.)</p><p class="body-text">Extra credit: Gently massage your moisturizer on your face to boost blood circulation, suggests Debra Luftman, M.D., a dermatologist in Beverly Hills, CA. "This helps bring oxygen to skin's surface, making it look nourished and healthy."</p><h2 class="body-h2">2. The Cause: You're not exfoliating. </h2><p>Chances are you're washing your face every day. But there's a crucial skincare routine step that you may be missing: exfoliating. Though the skin naturally exfoliates itself, sometimes the process slows down, leading to more dull-looking skin. By using an exfoliator, you remove dry, dead skin cells, creating a fresh canvas that allows topical products to penetrate better, says Hadley King, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City. "Exfoliation is the best way to smooth skin's surface so it reflects light and appears glowing or brightened," says GH Beauty Lab Director Sabina Wizemann.</p><h4 class="body-h4">The Best Treatment:</h4><p>Incorporate one type of exfoliator at a time — either a physical formula like a face scrub or a chemical one such as a face peel— into your routine. Start slow, about two or three times a week, to avoid skin irritation and damage, and the Beauty Lab recommends protecting freshly-exfoliated skin with a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ face sunscreen every morning. Try one of these Beauty Lab go-tos:</p><h2 class="body-h2">3. The Cause: You're dehydrated — and so is your skin.</h2><p>Are you drinking enough water? Dehydration decreases the volume of blood flow to the skin, which can make you look "pale and sickly," explains Tammie Umbel, founder of Shea Terra Organics. Though dehydration may seem like a short-term problem solved by one glass of water, Janet Prystowsky, M.D., Ph.D., a dermatologist in New York, encourages viewing skin dehydration as a long-term issue. Consistently failing to give your skin the hydration it needs can cause lasting damage, like fine lines, sagging skin and even scales or deep wrinkles from severe chronic dehydration.</p><h4 class="body-h4">The Best Treatment:</h4><p>Drink up! Make sure you're drinking enough water: Aim for at least eight cups per day of water or other sugar- and caffeine-free beverages like naturally flavored seltzers, recommends Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition Lab Director, Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., NASM-CPT.</p><h2 class="body-h2">4. The Cause: You're super stressed. </h2><p class="body-text">Whether brought on by a pressing deadline, an argument, a big life change or just the day-to-day grind, feeling anxious really does play a role in your skin's brilliance — or lack of it. "Stress causes the hormone cortisol to increase, which can negatively affect blood flow to skin and skin repair," Dr. Luftman explains. This, in turn, can cause your skin to look more dull than usual.</p><h4 class="body-h4">The Best Treatment:</h4><p>Carve out a few minutes per day (or more!) to de-stress. Try a quick yoga session, mindful breathing or a soak in an aromatherapy bath (look for bubble bath products with lavender, which studies show helps promote relaxation). "These help relax your body and bring your mind to the present," says George Slavich, Ph.D., director of the Laboratory for Stress Assessment and Research at UCLA. The result: a more peaceful you — and healthier, more radiant skin over time.</p><h2 class="body-h2">5. The Cause: You are sleep deprived.</h2><p>Anything that keeps you up at night can stand between you and glowing skin. "Sleep is when your skin cells repair themselves and regenerate," Dr. Palm explains. "If that period is shortened or altered, skin cells can't perform at their optimum level."</p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>The Best Treatment:</strong> </h4><p>Aim to log about seven to nine hours of sleep per night. For added anti-aging benefits while you sleep, apply a night treatment with an ingredient like retinol to boost collagen production while you doze. If you need an extra boost of moisturizing power, swap in a super-nourishing overnight face mask weekly in place of night cream. (In GH Beauty Lab testing, Osmotics Cosmeceuticals Blue Copper 5 Prime Sleep Tight Mask upped skin's moisture levels an impressive 45%.)</p><h2 class="body-h2">6. The Cause: The environment is affecting your skin. </h2><p>Environmental changes can be tough on your skin. Factors such as air pollution, low humidity, harsh winds and exposure to UV rays from the sun can dull unprotected skin. In one study, researchers tracked women who lived in rural places and others in urban areas for over 20 years and found that the city dwellers ended up with significantly more lines and dark spots. </p><h4 class="body-h4"><strong>The Best Treatment:</strong> </h4><p>You don't have to relocate (or hide in a cave all day) to keep your skin smooth and even. Wearing SPF is the first and most important step. Apply sunscreen (even if it's cloudy) to shield against UV rays and pollution plus an antioxidant serum every morning. This will help "stop the free radicals we're exposed to in the environment from harming skin," advises Annie Chiu, M.D., a dermatologist and the director of The Derm Institute in Redondo Beach, CA. (Some of the most effective antioxidants are vitamin C, green and white tea and resveratrol.)</p><p>Another defense: Be diligent about cleansing your face each night. Otherwise, gunk from the day can build up on your face and clog pores while you sleep. </p><h2 class="body-h2">7. The Cause: You're a smoker. </h2><p>Not only is puffing away harmful to your lung health, but it can also sap skin's glow. "Carcinogenic substances are extremely detrimental to skin integrity and structure," Dr. Palm says. "Cigarette smoking causes collagen breakdown, making skin appear sallow, waxy and wrinkled over time." </p><h4 class="body-h4">The Best Treatment:</h4><p>Seek out help to quit smoking; your body will thank you. Fun fact: Did you know that Good Housekeeping reported that tobacco and smoking were harmful and might be linked to cancer 36 years (!) before the Surgeon General said so?</p><h2 class="body-h2">8. The Cause: You're overdoing it with matte makeup. </h2><p>Avoid overly-mattifying cosmetics like heavy or chalky powders, which absorb skin's natural oils (and glow). And make sure your makeup remover doesn't contain alcohol, as that can dry out your skin big time.</p><h4 class="body-h4">The Best Treatment:</h4><p>Opt for a base like a BB cream that's lightweight and moisturizing — or, if you're looking for more coverage, a foundation for dry skin (look for words like "radiance," "glow" or "luminous" on the bottle). "These bounce light off the skin so it looks more even-toned," says makeup artist Troy Surratt, cofounder of Surratt Beauty.</p><p>A touch of cream highlighter in a champagne color for fair skin or gold for medium to dark skin instantly erases dullness too. Swipe it along the high points of your cheekbones and the tip of your nose for "a pretty, dewy effect that makes your entire face seem more luminous," Surratt recommends. Try some of these Beauty Lab test winners and favorites:</p><h2 class="body-h2">9. The Cause: You're not eating a healthy diet.</h2><p>The age-old saying "you are what you eat" very much applies here. What you put into your body is reflected in your complexion, so don't expect to under-nourish your body and see radiant skin.</p><p>Try to reduce your intake of salty and processed foods — they "enhance tissue swelling through fluid retention, which slows down ideal light reflection," Dr. Palm says. Nutritionist Paula Simpson recommends steering clear of the "typical Western diet" altogether, which in her own words includes ingredients that are "high in sugar and fat and devoid of fiber, antioxidants, high-quality protein and essential fatty acids," all major culprits when it comes to dull skin.</p><p>When it comes to natural solutions, there are plenty of healthy food options out there you can incorporate into your diet to please both your stomach and your skin. Dr. Howe suggests antioxidant-rich food like blueberries, cranberries, red beans and pinto beans, while Dr. Palm advises good-fat treats like avocados and walnuts, as well as citrus fruits and kiwi, which contain vitamin C.</p><p>An additional natural solution to glowing skin: turmeric. The bright yellow spice is known for calming inflammation and brightening skin tone with consistent use over time, as it's full of antioxidant and anti-microbial properties. Apply it topically or ingest it to reap the benefits.</p><h2 class="body-h2">If none of these solutions help, consider visiting a dermatologist.</h2><p>Still dealing with dull skin despite feeling like you've tried it all? Schedule a visit with a board-certified dermatologist. There are several in-office treatments you can try, such as a chemical peel, RF microneedling or even injections.</p><p>GH Beauty Award-winning pro treatment PCA Skin No-Peel Peel is made with lactic acid that's safe for even sensitive skin; in testing, it proved to brighten skin with little discomfort or redness.</p><p>Cartessa Aesthetics VirtueRF Microneedling (a GH Beauty Award-winning treatment that uses both radiofrequency and microneedling) helped improve a tester's post-acne hyperpigmentation and skin's brightness.</p><p>Skinvive, another GH Beauty Award winner, injects dozens of micro-droplets of hyaluronic acid into skin to hydrate and smooth, boosting radiance for up to six months. Lab evaluations showed more light reflecting off our tester's skin after one treatment. </p></main>
