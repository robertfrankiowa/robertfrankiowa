    <main><h1>10 White Foods: Cancer-Fighting Superfood You Need to Eat More</h1><p>As the pandemic continues, people are interested in boosting their immune systems. Popular methods for boosting immunity include exercise, a healthy diet, and supplements. However, these can be challenging to maintain consistently. The easiest and most sustainable way to improve immunity is through food. Specifically, white foods can help improve your immune system.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Black Food VS White Food</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pvLHW_10_white_foods_cancer_fighting_superfood_you_need_to_eat_more.jpg" alt="10 White Foods: Cancer-Fighting Superfood You Need to Eat More"><figcaption><em>10 White Foods: Cancer-Fighting Superfood You Need to Eat More.

On the other hand, white foods, such as pears, bellflower roots, onions, garlic, mushrooms, and ginseng, are known to boost immunity. Root vegetables are also categorized as white foods.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Garlic: Excellent in Cancer Prevention</h2><p>Koreans consume garlic more than any other country in the world. Even in countries with high garlic consumption, the annual per capita consumption is less than 1kg. In contrast, Koreans consume about 6 to 7 times. Garlic is anticarcinogenic and is recommended by the National Cancer Institute in the United States. It is also known for its excellent antioxidant effects. In addition, garlic contains various micronutrients such as fiber, vitamin B, calcium, iron, and allicin.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vitamin-filled Cauliflower</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pvAlO_10_white_foods_cancer_fighting_superfood_you_need_to_eat_more.jpg" alt="10 White Foods: Cancer-Fighting Superfood You Need to Eat More"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cauliflower may look like white broccoli, but its texture is crunchier and firmer. It is rich in vitamin C, and consuming just 3.5 oz can meet the daily recommended dose of vitamin C. One of its characteristics is that it doesn’t lose much of its nutritional value when heated. Furthermore, cauliflower contains a large amount of indole and sulforaphane. Among these, sulforaphane inhibits the activity of Helicobacter pylori, which helps prevent stomach ulcers and stomach cancer. Cauliflower tastes bitter, so adding vinegar and blanch is recommended for a better taste.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ginger: Warming the Body</h2><p>Ginger, known for its sharp and spicy flavor, is widely used in Western cuisine for cookies, candies, and cakes. It is harvested in the fall and early winter. Ginger has a warm nature and is used in cold weather for chills, headaches, and nasal congestion. You can easily make ginger syrup and use it throughout a cold winter.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bellflower Root: With a Fragrant Scent</h2><p>Bellflower root is rich in saponins. Saponins are known to strengthen immunity by protecting the lung mucosa. Bellflower root also contains isoflavones, which are similar to estrogen and can alleviate symptoms of menopause. If your immunity is weakened, try drinking bellflower root tea.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pear: Good for Respiratory Diseases</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pvOdI_10_white_foods_cancer_fighting_superfood_you_need_to_eat_more.jpg" alt="10 White Foods: Cancer-Fighting Superfood You Need to Eat More"><figcaption><em>.

Pears are highly effective for bronchial diseases, colds, and asthma because they help with bowel movement and eliminate phlegm. They also have a detoxifying effect, relieving hangovers.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Onion: Perfect for High Blood Pressure</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pvOdK_10_white_foods_cancer_fighting_superfood_you_need_to_eat_more.jpg" alt="10 White Foods: Cancer-Fighting Superfood You Need to Eat More"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Onions are rich in proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and other nutrients. They contain quercetin, which effectively lowers blood pressure. Quercetin is also effective in healing inflammation as it prevents cells from being attacked by active oxygen and peroxide lipids.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cabbage: Strengthening Bones</h2><p>Cabbage contains 44 mg of vitamin C per 100g, more than twice that of tomatoes. Just one cabbage leaf can nearly meet the daily requirement of 50 mg. Notably, the white parts of cabbage have more vitamin C, but it’s better to eat as a whole for balanced nutrition.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Burdock: Anti-aging Vegetable</h2><p>Burdock contains a flavonoid called polyphenol in the white part of the root. Polyphenols are known for their antioxidant properties and immune system regulation. Furthermore, burdock is rich in fiber and contains a lot of lignin, which helps to excrete cholesterol from the body.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mushroom: Rich in Dietary Fiber</h2><p>Mushrooms are a high-protein, low-calorie food rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, iron, zinc, and other minerals. Due to their rich fiber content, they have low calories but are satisfying. Hence, they are highly regarded as excellent weight-loss meals. Mushrooms contain as much as 40% dietary fiber, which helps to excrete waste and carcinogens and purify the blood.</p></main>
