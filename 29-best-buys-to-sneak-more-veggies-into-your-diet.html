    <main><h1>29 Best Buys to Sneak More Veggies Into Your Diet</h1><p>It's no secret that increasing your veggie intake can improve your overall health. But it can be hard to reach your recommended daily intake of produce without feeling deprived of your favorite foods or if you face a panel of picky eaters at mealtime.</p><p>Fortunately, packaged food companies have become more creative at sneaking "hidden" veggies into snacks, meals, and treats that look and taste like familiar packaged foods. From crunchy, salty bagged snacks to seemingly decadent desserts, it's easier than ever to find grocery store items brimming with secret added vegetables.</p><p>Why might you want to grab a bag of veggie-based chips instead of tortilla or potato chips? "Vegetables often contain fiber as well as a variety of vitamins and minerals that help our bodies function at peak performance," says <strong>Shandi Trout, RDN</strong>. "Increasing your vegetable intake can help with reducing bloating, weight loss, lowering cholesterol, improving mental health, improving insulin resistance, and balancing hormones." Trout recommends that her clients add an extra vegetable at every meal to reach at least 30 grams of fiber per day.</p><p>The amount of veggies you eat isn't the only thing to keep in mind. Eating a greater variety of vegetables "will increase your gut health and provide a variety of essential nutrients," notes Trout.</p><p>Not all store-bought items that contain extra vegetables are good for you, though. "Often foods with "hidden" vegetables come with high amounts of added sugars, sodium, and highly processed ingredients, which can counter the benefits of vegetables by increasing cholesterol, blood sugar, and creating an imbalance in gut health," says Trout.</p><p>So to help you steer clear of misleading marketing claims, we've compiled a list of the best store-bought foods made with hidden vegetables to boost your nutrient intake without sacrificing flavor. Read on, and for more, don't miss 9 Best High-Fiber Vegetables—Ranked!</p><h2>1.
