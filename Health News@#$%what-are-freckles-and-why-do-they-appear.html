    <main><h1>What Are Freckles and Why Do They Appear?</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Brendan Camp, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Brendan Camp, MD</strong><p>Freckles are small, light brown, or reddish spots on the skin. They usually appear on areas exposed to the sun, like your face, arms, hands, back, or chest. The cause of freckles is an overproduction of melanin, a pigment that gives your skin and hair color.  </p><p>There are two types of freckles: ephelidesand solar lentigines. Ephelides are the kind you develop during childhood. Solar lentigines are freckles, age spots, and sun spots you typically acquire during adulthood.</p><p>Freckles usually are harmless, but you should watch any freckles that change in appearance over time. Some freckles warrant a visit to a healthcare provider. People with freckles may be more likely to develop skin cancer.</p><p>This article discusses everything you need to know about freckles, including what causes them, how to prevent them, and ways to make them fade.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pOose_an_image_of_a_woman_applying_moisturizer_on_her_face.jpg" alt="An image of a woman applying moisturizer on her face"><figcaption><em>Westend61 / Getty Images.

It protects your skin from sun damage by soaking in and reflecting ultraviolet (UV) light. Melanin is what gives your hair, skin, and eyes their color.</p><p>People with very fair complexions produce more melanin in the sun, which means that instead of tanning, they develop freckles.</p><h2>What Increases Your Chance for Freckles?</h2><p>Spending a lot of time outdoors and in the sun increases your risk for freckles. Freckles are also genetic, so if your parents had freckles, you may have them, too.</p><p>Having lighter skin and burning easily can increase your chances of developing freckles. People with naturally blond or red hair are also at a higher risk.</p><h2>Are Freckles Dangerous?</h2><p>Freckles generally are not dangerous. However, because freckles indicate UV-induced damage, they may increase your risk for skin cancer, including melanoma. You should monitor any freckles that change in color or size and report these changes to your healthcare provider. Sometimes, freckles are confused with moles, which could be cancerous.</p><h2>What Is the Difference Between Freckles and Sun Spots?</h2><p>Freckles can sometimes look like solar lentigines, commonly called “sun spots.” However, there are some differences between the two.</p><p>Typically, freckles (ephelides):</p><ul><li>Show up when you are around 2–3 years old</li><li>Are small in size, ranging from 1–2 millimeters (mm) in diameter</li><li>Are dark brown or red</li><li>Have irregular borders</li><li>Get darker in the summer</li></ul><p>Sun spots (solar lentigines):</p><ul><li>Are more common after age 50</li><li>Are larger than ephelides</li><li>Are light yellow to dark brown</li><li>Have clear borders</li><li>Appear all year long</li></ul><h2>Freckles vs. Moles</h2><p>Both moles and freckles tend to affect light-skinned people. However, they are different types of lesions.  </p><p>Moles are often larger than freckles. They tend to be raised from the skin’s surface, while freckles are flat. Moles can appear on their own or in clusters and range in color from dark brown to pink. Unlike freckles, moles can develop anywhere on your body.</p><h2>Should I See a Healthcare Provider for My Freckles or Moles?</h2><p>You should see a healthcare provider whenever your freckles or moles change appearance. Lesions that exhibit certain characteristics should also be checked to rule out melanoma.  </p><p>You should check your freckles and moles for what are known as the “ABCDEs” of melanoma, which include:</p><ul><li><strong>"A" for "asymmetry"</strong>: Moles that are not symmetrical may be more likely to be cancerous.</li><li><strong>"B" for "border</strong>": Cancerous moles may have uneven or bumpy borders.</li><li><strong>"C" for "color</strong>": Different colors in a mole could be a sign of melanoma.</li><li><strong>"D" for "diameter"</strong>: Larger moles are more likely to be cancerous.</li><li><strong>"E" for "evolving"</strong>: Moles or lesions that change shape, color, or size should be checked out.</li></ul><h2>Can I Prevent More Freckles From Appearing?</h2><p>Exposure to the sun is the main thing to avoid if you want to prevent freckles. Some tips for protecting your skin from UV rays include:</p><ul><li>Avoid being in the sun during the peak hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</li><li>Wear sun-protective clothing outdoors, including hats, sunglasses, long-sleeved shirts, and pants.</li><li>Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher outdoors. Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours, even on cloudy days.</li><li>Avoid any forms of tanning, including tanning beds.</li></ul><h3>Home Remedies</h3><p>Some people anecdotally report that certain home remedies can help fade or lessen the appearance of freckles. Though these methods are not scientifically proven, they are generally considered safe.</p><p>Some popular remedies that you can find online are:</p><ul><li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>: Some people claim that the vitamin C in lemon juice may help lighten dark spots. You can apply a small amount to a cotton ball and dab your skin with it.</li><li><strong>Aloe vera</strong>: Aloe vera contains salicylic acid, which some say can help minimize the appearance of freckles. Apply aloe vera directly from the leaf.</li><li><strong>Honey</strong>: Honey contains antioxidants that can help lighten freckles. Spread on a thin layer and wash it off after about 10 minutes.</li></ul><h3>Over-the-Counter Treatments</h3><p>Some over-the-counter (OTC), nonprescription treatments, such as peels, may lighten freckles and improve skin tone. These products may contain:  </p><ul><li>Alpha hydroxy acid</li><li>Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)</li><li>Vitamin C</li><li>Phenol</li><li>Retinoids</li></ul><p>It’s important to try a patch test before applying a harsh product to a large area. If you develop skin irritation, stop using it.</p><h3>Laser Therapy</h3><p>Laser therapy may be an option for treating sun-damaged skin, freckles, and sun spots. There are many different types of lasers, including laser resurfacing or intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy. Your healthcare provider can help you determine which laser is most effective for treating your skin.</p><p>Some treatments that can be used to remove or lessen the appearance of sun spots are:  </p><ul><li>Lasers</li><li>Cryotherapy (a procedure that uses liquid nitrogen to freeze sun spots)</li><li>Chemical peels (a chemical solution is placed on the skin to remove the top layers)</li></ul><p>Products that contain the ingredients retinoid and hydroquinone may help improve the look of sun spots.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Freckles are small spots that develop on your skin due to sun exposure. They are generally harmless, but you should see a healthcare provider if a freckle changes or looks unusual in any way. The best way to prevent freckles is to steer clear of the sun and protect your skin. If you want to lessen the appearance of freckles, some home remedies, OTC medicines, and medical treatments can help.</p></main>
