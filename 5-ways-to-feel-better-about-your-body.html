    <main><h1>5 Ways to Feel Better About Your Body</h1><p>Want to feel better about your body? You're not alone. "More than half of Americans feel pressured to have a certain body type, with 23% actively experiencing body dysmorphia and 20% having experienced it in the past. Yet, every body type is attractive and desired — and the vast majority of people aren't looking for perfection anyway," says the app Pure. Here are five ways to feel better about your body, no matter how you look.</p><figure><img title="5 Ways to Feel Better About Your Body" src="IMG/BB1nrzSo_5_ways_to_feel_better_about_your_body.jpg" alt="5 Ways to Feel Better About Your Body"><figcaption><em>5 Ways to Feel Better About Your Body. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 This is the Essential First Step</h2><p>"Feeling good about yourself in any context starts with a strong base of positive, healthy habits," says Catherine Rall, Registered Dietitian, Happy V. "Getting enough sleep each night and consistently eating a balanced, healthy diet that includes plenty of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and hydration is going to make you feel physically better, and take your mood and self-image up along with it. This isn't going to magically resolve any body image issues you may have, nor is it going to automatically build a strong relationship with your partner, but it's an essential first step."</p><figure><img title="1 This is the Essential First Step" src="IMG/BB1md6nS_1_this_is_the_essential_first_step.jpg" alt="1 This is the Essential First Step"><figcaption><em>1 This is the Essential First Step. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Indeed, Your Mental and Physical State are Linked</h2><p>"As a personal trainer, I often remind people how their mental state and their physical state are intrinsically linked. You can't separate them," says David Rosales, NSCA-CPT, of Roman Fitness Systems. "No matter what fancy techniques you can get into, you have to do the basics for your physical body, which puts you mentally in a good state. Here are the biggest ones, in my opinion.</p><p>1. Sleep. Nothing will help you feel better about everything than consistent good sleep. Put your phone away 60 minutes before bed. Scrolling social media is where good sleep goes to do.</p><p>2. Have a consistent sleep routine. It's easier to fall asleep if you're used to falling asleep at that time. And prioritize it! Most importantly, commit to making sleep a priority. Otherwise, you'll always struggle with it.</p><p>3. Movement. Of course, you could focus on strength training here, but if you're lacking internal mental confidence, one of the best things for your mood is to just go on a walk. As a tactical step, I recommend the "zero-zero" approach. That is, make sure you have zero days with zero movement. Even a 5-minute walk counts.</p><figure><img title="2 Indeed, Your Mental and Physical State are Linked" src="IMG/BB1nrttI_2_indeed_your_mental_and_physical_state_are_linked.jpg" alt="2 Indeed, Your Mental and Physical State are Linked"><figcaption><em>2 Indeed, Your Mental and Physical State are Linked. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 These Exercises Could Help Your Appearance</h2><p>To improve your appearance your program should focus on compound movements (squats, split squats, deadlifts, pushing, and pulling) rather than focusing on "mirror" muscles. Lifting weights is important to optimize your hormones, specifically testosterone. So challenge yourself with the weights. Don't neglect cardio. Aim for three sessions of minutes per week. All of this will help you feel better in bed and life.</p><p>A fitness routine could contribute to improved self-confidence and body image. This can really vary by person. Here are some possible ways it can help.</p><p>— Improves physical strength and stamina, leading to more confidence.</p><p>— Improves mood (exercise is magic!) therefore leading to confidence.</p><p>— Gives you confidence that you can perform in all areas of life.</p><p>— Again, nutrition will help you everywhere. It will help you build muscle, lose fat, and improve blood flow.</p><figure><img title="3 These Exercises Could Help Your Appearance" src="IMG/BB1mCzL2_3_these_exercises_could_help_your_appearance.jpg" alt="3 These Exercises Could Help Your Appearance"><figcaption><em>3 These Exercises Could Help Your Appearance. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Do Your Kegels</h2><p>— Strength training is important not only for sculpting a healthy body but also for strengthening through exercises like squats, push-ups, and planks, which will help you feel more confident.</p><p>— Flexibility can be gained through exercises like yoga and Pilates.</p><p>— By doing cardio activities like running or cycling, you get toned abs.</p><p>Finally, if you're aiming to look and feel better, pelvic floor exercises like Kegels are your ticket."</p><figure><img title="4 Do Your Kegels" src="IMG/BB1lkZNN_4_do_your_kegels.jpg" alt="4 Do Your Kegels"><figcaption><em>4 Do Your Kegels. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 One Tip You've Never Considered: Visit Different Countries</h2><p>"As a multi-experienced entrepreneur and fitness enthusiast, I have learned that confidence affects various aspects of our lives, including intimacy. A proven way to build this confidence lies in physical and mental fitness," says Yulia Saf, known as Miss Tourist. "First, regular exercise, such as pilates and yoga, improves body flexibility and strength, enhancing body image perception and boosting confidence. Second, traveling or living in different countries can expose one to diverse body beauty standards, fostering more acceptance and appreciation of one's own body. Lastly, fostering a growth mindset encourages continuous self-improvement and focuses less on imperfections and more on progress, significantly improving self-confidence. I believe that fitness is very holistic: the mind, body, and spirit must be in sync for a person to genuinely feel good about themselves, not only mentally but also physically."
