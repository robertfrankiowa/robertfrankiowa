    <main><h1>Possible Causes of Throbbing Tooth Pain and What to Do</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Edmund Khoo, DDS</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Edmund Khoo, DDS</strong><p>Many people describe throbbing tooth pain as pulsing. This tooth pain typically indicates injury or infection in the mouth—often a cavity or an abscess. However, there are many possible causes.</p><p>Since it can be caused by something serious, it's important to address throbbing tooth pain promptly. You cannot diagnose the cause based on symptoms alone. An exam and diagnosis should be made by a dentist.</p><p>This article covers symptoms and causes of throbbing tooth pain and what to do.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oRw4z_a_dental_healthcare_provider_uses_a_dental_camera_in_an_exam.jpg" alt="A dental healthcare provider uses a dental camera in an exam"><figcaption><em>Iuliia Burmistrova / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Other Symptoms</h2><p>In addition to throbbing, the following symptoms may accompany this type of tooth pain:</p><ul><li>Fever</li><li>Pus</li><li>Bad taste</li><li>Foul smell</li><li>Gum swelling</li><li>Sensitivity to cold and hot</li></ul><p>A throbbing tooth doesn't always mean you have an infection, but an infection—like from an abscessed tooth—is likely if you experience these accompanying symptoms. See a dentist as soon as possible if you have tooth pain accompanied by fever, pus, or other signs of infection.</p><h2>Common Causes of Throbbing Tooth Pain and Treatment Options</h2><p>Teeth can hurt for many reasons. Treatment often depends on the cause of the pain.</p><h3>Cavities and Tooth Decay</h3><p>A cavity is a hole in your tooth caused by tooth decay. Since you can't resolve a cavity at home, getting a dental exam is the only way to determine cause and resolve throbbing pain from a cavity.</p><p>Treatment options for a cavity include:</p><ul><li>Repairing with fluoride (for minor cavities)</li><li>Repairing with a dental filling</li><li>Repairing with more complicated treatments, like a root canal (removal of the pulp chamber of the tooth) or pulling the tooth (extraction)</li></ul><h3>Dental Infections</h3><p>One of the best-known dental infections is a tooth abscess. This type of infection is most likely to cause throbbing tooth pain. It must be treated by a dental professional to resolve the infection and keep it from spreading, which can lead to serious complications.</p><p>Treatment for an abscessed tooth includes:</p><ul><li>Root canal or tooth extraction: To eliminate the source of infection</li><li>Antibiotics: To address the infection</li><li>Saltwater rinses: To help reduce pain, inhibit bacteria, and help prevent complications after an extraction or dental surgery</li><li>Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers: To relieve fever and pain</li></ul><h3>Tooth Fracture</h3><p>A cracked or chipped tooth may also lead to throbbing tooth pain. This cause of tooth pain is not resolvable at home. You'll need help from a dentist to repair the crack so an infection doesn't settle in.</p><p>Dentists treat tooth fractures in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Covering them with dental crowns</li><li>Root canal</li><li>Extraction</li></ul><h3>Damaged Filling</h3><p>Fillings typically do not last a lifetime. Over time, they break down and need to be repaired or replaced. If your filling becomes damaged, loosens, or falls out, it can lead to throbbing tooth pain. To treat, a dentist will replace the filling, or you may need a crown if the tooth structure is compromised.</p><h3>Loose Crown</h3><p>Crowns periodically need to be replaced. Underneath your crown, your tooth has been whittled down for the crown to fit. When a crown becomes loose or falls off, it leaves behind the sensitive part of your tooth, which may result in throbbing tooth pain.</p><p>A dentist may need to glue the existing crown back in place. Other times, you may require an entirely new crown. In the meantime, you will receive a temporary crown, which will alleviate your pain.</p><h3>Weak Enamel</h3><p>When the outer layer of your teeth (the enamel) becomes weak, it can lead to throbbing tooth pain. The following can lead to enamel erosion and weakness:</p><ul><li>Gastroesophagealreflux disease (GERD): A condition of chronic acid reflux</li><li>Bulimia: An eating disorder involving binging and purging food</li><li>Alcohol misuse</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Consuming sweet beverages and foods</li></ul><p>Since some reasons for weak enamel are preventable, it's best to reduce your risk of developing weak enamel by making healthy food choices and treating underlying health conditions. If you develop weak enamel, your dentist may advise lifestyle modifications and offer restorative treatments, including fluoride treatments.</p><h3>Bruxism (Teeth Grinding or Clenching)</h3><p>Grinding or clenching your teeth can also lead to throbbing tooth pain. The extreme pressure exerted on your teeth can lead to the following kinds of tooth damage:</p><ul><li>Chipped or cracked teeth</li><li>Loose teeth</li><li>Worn tooth enamel</li></ul><p>Treatment for bruxism primarily includes stress management and using a mouth guard when you sleep. If your teeth are damaged, repairs like fillings and crowns may be required.</p><h3>Gum Disease</h3><p>Gum disease is a common cause of throbbing tooth pain. Gum disease can lead to loose teeth, sensitive teeth, and pain while chewing. A periodontist (a dentist specializing in gum disease) will help you develop a plan for caring for your gums at home. They may also clean your gums in the office.</p><h3>Injury to the Teeth or Face</h3><p>If you injure your teeth or face, you may experience throbbing tooth pain. That's especially true if your teeth become cracked or broken. Treatment for tooth injuries involves repairing the damaged tooth, including things like dental crowns or extractions.</p><h3>Erupted or Impacted Tooth</h3><p>When teeth are erupting through the gums or impacted (unable to erupt), it can lead to throbbing tooth pain. This is quite common with wisdom teeth. If the teeth can erupt on their own, the pain will resolve afterward. In the case of wisdom teeth, you are likely to need them extracted.</p><h2>Other Possible Causes</h2><p>In addition to more common causes, some less common things can cause throbbing tooth pain.</p><h3>Dental Appliances</h3><p>Throbbing tooth pain is common as people adjust to dental appliances, like orthodontic appliances that put pressure on the teeth. Pain and discomfort are the most common side effects of orthodontic appliances. This is normal and usually goes away after your teeth adjust to the device. In other cases, your dental appliance may not fit well and needs to be adjusted.</p><h3>Food or Debris Stuck in Teeth</h3><p>Sometimes, tooth pain is caused by food stuck between your teeth. Food creates pressure, which can be painful. If this could be the source of your pain, use floss to remove the particles for immediate relief.</p><h3>Abnormal Bite</h3><p>A bad bite, known as malocclusion, can lead to tooth pain. Misaligned teeth can hit in the wrong way, resulting in pain. The solution for an abnormal bite is orthodontic treatment.</p><h3>Referred Pain</h3><p>Referred pain is when dental pain is the result of pain from another part of the body. Referred dental pain may result from the following:</p><ul><li>Muscle pain</li><li>Migraines</li><li>Cluster headaches</li><li>Heart disease</li></ul><h3>Sinus Infection</h3><p>It is not uncommon for sinus infection pain to radiate to the teeth. That's because these systems are interconnected, and the surrounding area's inflammation often impacts the upper teeth. The solution is to treat the sinus infection.</p><p>Shingles (reactivation of the virus that causes chicken pox) can present with tooth pain. Pain relievers and antiviral medications may help with this type of pain. To prevent shingles, get vaccinated if you are over 50 or if you have a weakened immune system and are over age 18.</p><h2>Home Remedies and Self-Care Tips</h2><p>While you wait to see a dentist, you can find tooth pain relief at home. Try some self-care measures and home remedies to stop your tooth from throbbing. The following may help temporarily:</p><ul><li>Rinse with a warm saltwater solution.</li><li>Use dental floss to ensure nothing is stuck between the teeth.</li><li>Apply a cold compress to the affected area.</li><li>Avoid hot or cold foods and beverages.</li><li>Take medication to relieve a toothache, like an OTC pain reliever.</li></ul><h2>When to See a Dentist</h2><p>If the above toothache remedies don't stop or you need more help to stop tooth pain fast, it's best to see a dentist. Some reasons to see a dentist for throbbing tooth pain include:</p><ul><li>Your tooth pain is unbearable.</li><li>You can't sleep.</li><li>You have throbbing pain that affects your daily activity.</li><li>Your pain lasts for more than a couple of days.</li><li>You experience swelling.</li><li>You have a fever.</li><li>You have an earache.</li><li>You experience pain when your mouth is wide open.</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Throbbing tooth pain is commonly felt with many tooth and health conditions. It's most often the result of decay, infection, or injury, but it can also be caused by many other things.</p><p>Since the source of the problem nearly always requires medical attention, it's important to see a dentist for cases of throbbing tooth pain. While you wait for your appointment, try OTC pain relievers and warm saltwater rinses, and avoid cold and hot foods and drinks.</p></main>
