    <main><h1>Bone Cancer Without Knowing: How Long Can It Go Undiagnosed?</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Doru Paul, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Doru Paul, MD</strong><p>Bone cancer is a rare type of cancer, which can go undetected for some time before being diagnosed. Although benign (non-cancerous) bone tumors are more common than malignant (cancerous) bone tumors, malignant bone cancer can be an aggressive cancer, and some types grow quickly. Quick progression makes early detection and treatment all the more important.</p><p>Although early detection is possible, many factors can lead to delayed diagnosis. For instance, pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, but it might not be present all the time in the beginning, which can make it seem nothing of concern. </p><p>This article talks about why a bone cancer diagnosis can be delayed, how a bone cancer diagnosis is confirmed, and what follow-up and treatment look like.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pKwp2_healthcare_provider_speaking_with_patient.jpg" alt="healthcare provider speaking with patient"><figcaption><em>FatCamera / Getty Images.

Although bone cancer isn’t common and symptoms are more likely to be caused by other health conditions, such as an injury, symptoms that don’t go away should be talked about with a healthcare provider to get to the bottom of what’s causing them. It’s important to catch bone cancer early so that treatment can be started as soon as possible. </p><h3>Reasons for Delayed Diagnosis</h3><p>Diagnosis of bone cancer may be delayed for a number of reasons. Some researchers note that delayed diagnosis may be because bone cancers are rare, making up less than 1% of all cancer cases, and general practitioners (aka primary healthcare providers) see very few cases in their entire careers, making it difficult to recognize bone cancer if and when it does occur in patients. </p><p>Delayed diagnosis also occurs because bone cancer symptoms can be nonspecific, meaning they don’t immediately point to bone cancer. For example, bone pain can be caused by several different health conditions. Furthermore, pain and swelling caused by bone cancer can look and feel like common musculoskeletal injuries and therefore not be seen as cause for concern. </p><p>Another reason for delayed diagnosis is that symptoms of bone cancer may go away for a period of time. These periods of no symptoms may lead doctors and people with bone cancer to think whatever condition was causing the symptoms has resolved.</p><h3>Do Symptoms Always Precede Diagnosis?</h3><p>Since there are no widely recommended screenings for bone cancer like there are for other cancers, such as breast cancer or colorectal cancer, signs and symptoms of bone cancer are a key part of diagnosis. Pain where the tumor is located is the most common symptom of bone cancer.</p><p>Bone pain and swelling that doesn’t go away should be talked about with a healthcare provider. Experts note that for healthcare providers, considering bone cancer as a possible diagnosis given presenting symptoms of bone cancer and promptly ordering imaging can help reduce delays in diagnosis.</p><h2>Detecting Bone Cancer: How to Know for Sure</h2><p>In addition to identifying symptoms, accurate diagnosis of bone cancer requires collecting information on which bone and what part of the bone is affected and what the tumor looks like. Furthermore, it’s important to know whether the cancer has spread from a different part of the body and whether it’s a benign tumor. Detecting bone cancer usually involves a few steps:</p><ul><li>Medical history and physical exam</li><li>Imaging tests, such as a bone scan, MRI, X-ray, CT scan, or PET scan</li><li>Biopsy</li></ul><p>Some imaging tests might strongly suggest bone cancer is present, but taking a biopsy and looking at the tissue under a microscope is the only way to know for sure. Blood tests may also be used to determine the type of bone cancer and how advanced the cancer is.</p><p>A physical exam and a thorough list of symptoms are important to help differentiate bone cancer from other bone conditions since symptoms of other bone disorders, such as osteoporosis and arthritis, can mimic symptoms of bone cancer. </p><p>For instance, arthritis symptoms include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving one or more joints. Bone cancer symptoms can sometimes look like arthritis symptoms since bone cancers often cause swelling and tenderness if the tumor is located close to a joint. In addition, both bone cancer pain and arthritis pain may get worse with certain activities. Other symptoms of bone cancer, like a lump in the arms, legs, chest, or pelvis; fever; and a bone that spontaneously breaks, may help differentiate arthritis symptoms from bone cancer symptoms.</p><p>Bone cancer can also weaken the bones, making them more susceptible to fracture. Similarly, osteoporosis can cause bones to become so fragile that they easily fracture. </p><p>Multiple myeloma, a rare type of blood cancer, can also cause bone pain and weakened bones. Bone pain from multiple myeloma is most often in the hips, lower and/or middle back, or rib cage.</p><p>Keep in mind that bone pain can mean many different things. If you have bone pain that doesn’t go away or comes and goes, talk with a healthcare provider so that they can look into causes and design a treatment plan, if needed.</p><h2>Bone Cancer and Speed of Progression</h2><p>It’s important for bone cancer to be detected early since having bone cancer symptoms for a long time is associated with larger tumors and higher rates of cancer spreading (metastasis). A biopsy can show whether it started in the bone (primary bone tumor) or spread from a different part of the body (metastatic tumor).</p><p>Both benign and malignant primary bone tumors can grow and compress healthy bone tissue, but benign bone tumors usually don’t destroy healthy tissue and rarely spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>How quickly bone cancer progresses depends on the type of bone cancer. Both osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma tumors grow rapidly and spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs. Chondrosarcoma usually develops slowly, though it, too, can grow quickly and spread. The quick progression of some bone cancers make early diagnosis all the more important.</p><h2>Follow-Up and Treatment With Diagnosed Bone Cancer</h2><p>The physical exam, imaging, and biopsy used to diagnose bone cancer are also used to determine the stage of bone cancer. Treatment of bone cancer depends on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Type of bone cancer</li><li>Tumor size</li><li>Location of the tumor</li><li>Stage of the cancer</li></ul><p>Referral to a cancer center is key to improving quality of life and maximizing survival. Since primary bone cancers are rare and treatment is complex, they are usually treated by a team of healthcare providers. Treatment for bone cancer may involve:</p><ul><li>Surgery (the usual treatment)</li><li>Chemotherapy</li><li>Radiation therapy</li><li>Targeted therapy/drugs</li><li>Cryotherapy</li></ul><p><p>The outlook for bone cancer is based on the type of bone cancer and if and how far it has spread.</p><p>For example, the five-year survival rate for osteosarcoma, based on data from 2012 to 2018, is 76% in the localized stage (cancer hasn’t spread from the bone it started in), 64% in the regional stage (cancer spread beyond the bone it started in to nearby bones or organs/tissues), and 24% in the distant stage (cancer spread to distant parts of the body).</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that survival rates are estimates. And because treatments improve over time, people newly diagnosed with bone cancer may have a better outlook. It’s best to talk to your healthcare team about the prognosis after a diagnosis so that they can tell you what to expect based on your situation.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Due to many factors, bone cancer can go undetected for a while, but early diagnosis is possible. Identifying common symptoms, such as bone pain that doesn’t go away, and promptly undergoing diagnostic tests if bone cancer is suspected are key to early detection. Because some types of bone cancer can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to a better prognosis and quality of life.</p>
