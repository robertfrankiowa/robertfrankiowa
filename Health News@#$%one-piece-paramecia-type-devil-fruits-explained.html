These special fruits are easily identifiable due to their whacky appearance and are characterized by their signature ability of giving people special powers or properties once they are eaten. The sheer number of Devil Fruits introduced in the series is astonishing, with each one being characterized as either a Logia, Zoan, or Paramecia type.   </p><p>      The latter is the most common of all the Devil Fruits found on the Grand Line, due to which the abilities that they give are the most varied and diverse. Throughout the runtime of <em>One Piece</em>, many different Paramecia type Devil Fruits have been introduced and the abilities that they gift to their innumerable users vary from incredibly weak to astronomically powerful. So, let's break down what Paramecia-type Devil Fruits are.   </p><span data-embed-id="6ba6bc4caaf44ae8879e890b04ac39e3">   </span><h5 class="display-card-title ">One Piece: The Most Legendary Right-Hand Men In The Series, Ranked</h5><h2>            <strong>What Are Paramecia Type Devil Fruits?</strong>        </h2><table>            <tr>                          <th>    <p>      First Appearance  </p>  </th>        <td>    <p>      <em>One Piece</em>, Episode 1, "I'm Luffy!

Whereas Zoan types give the ability to transform into an animal or animal-human hybrid and Logia types give the power of a natural element, Paramecia types are broadly defined as those Devil Fruits that give the user an ability that doesn't fall under the banner of the other two.   </p><p>      Every Devil Fruit is a possibility for human evolution that someone desired!  </p><p>      The Gomu Gomu no Mi is a perfect example of this, as it gives Luffy the ability to stretch by becoming a rubber human, something that doesn't fall into the other 2 Devil Fruit categories. Due to this, Paramecia types are the most common kinds of Devil Fruits found throughout the world and, subsequently, are also the most diverse in terms of the abilities they give to the users. Each Devil Fruit comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses and though some have abilities that are similar to others, all Fruits are unique.   </p><span data-embed-id="a219aec9d1894b1c9747a9f98e58782b">   </span><h5 class="display-card-title ">One Piece: 7 Strongest Characters Who Can Use All Three Types Of Haki</h5><h2>            <strong>Paramecia Types Categories</strong>        </h2><p>      While Paramecia type Devil Fruits are one of the 3 groups of Devil Fruits, they themselves have 3 sub-categories that are differentiated by how they affect the user. Since they're the most common kinds of Devil Fruits out there, the abilities they give are also just as varied, so let's take a look at the different kinds of powers granted by the Paramecia type Devil Fruits.   </p><h3>      <strong>Body Alteration:</strong>  </h3><p>      Some Paramecia type Devil Fruits give their users the ability to alter their bodies, or parts of them, in accordance with the ability given to them by the Fruit. An example of this kind of Devil Fruit is Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turns Luffy into a rubber human, letting him stretch his body as much as he wants. Some body-altering fruits, such as this one, permanently alter the body composition of their user without needing to be activated with a mental command, which is why Luffy is in the rubber human state at all times.   </p><h3>      <strong>Environmental Manipulation:</strong>  </h3><p>      These are very strong Devil Fruits, as they give the users abilities that can have a startling effect on the surrounding environment. Whether it's used on living things or inanimate objects, these kinds of Paramecia types are incredibly powerful as they can leave quite a destructive impact on the environment or even create their own, as is the case with Trafalgar D. Water Law's Ope Ope no Mi. Much like Paramecia types in general, these fruits are wide-spanning and quite broad in their definition, only that they have some sort of effect on the environment.   </p><h3>      <strong>Substance Manipulation:</strong>  </h3><p>      Much like the Logia Devil Fruits, some Paramecia types give users the ability to use and manipulate different substances. However, unlike Logia types, these substances are not natural elements and the users of these fruits cannot transform themselves into their substance like Logia users can, with the biggest difference being that these Paramecia types control substances that are manmade or just don't naturally occur. Some of these Paramecia types can not only conjure substances but also many powerful avatars to fight for their users.   </p><span data-embed-id="59186fecec7f42ca8460a8f84270e275">   </span><h5 class="display-card-title ">One Piece: 8 Powers Imu Could Have</h5><h2>            <strong>Notable Paramecia Type Devil Fruits</strong>        </h2><p>      Due to how common and important Paramecia types are to the overall <em>One Piece </em>story, there have been many introduced in the series. However, only a few have truly stuck as being some of the strongest fruits, with their users being among some of the most powerful characters on the Grand Line. So, let's take a look at the most important Paramecia type Devil Fruits in <em>One Piece</em>.   </p><p>      These Devil Fruits users are always so dependent on their special abilities.  </p><ul>          <li>            <strong>Gomu Gomu no Mi: </strong>The Gum-Gum fruit, eaten by Luffy at the very start of the series, gives him the power to stretch his body like rubber. Later, this fruit is revealed to also be a Mythical Zoan fruit that transforms Luffy into Sun God Nika.      </li>          <li>            <strong>Gura Gura no Mi: </strong>Perhaps the strongest Devil Fruit in terms of destructive output, eaten by Edward Newgate/Whitebeard. It gives him the power to create incredibly powerful earthquakes or tremors that can travel through the ground, water, or even air. It is said Whitebeard could have destroyed the entire world with this Devil Fruit, which was the strongest of all Paramecia types.      </li>          <li>            <strong>Ope Ope no Mi: </strong>This Paramecia type was given to Trafalgar D. Water Law, and it allows him to create a separate domain from the outside world, in which he can surgically alter anything down to a subatomic level.      </li>          <li>            <strong>Soru Soru no Mi: </strong>An extremely powerful Devil Fruit, this Paramecia type was used by the Yonko, Big Mom, and it gave her the ability to rip out anyone's soul from their body and could even reanimate the dead.      </li>          <li>            <strong>Zushi Zushi no Mi: </strong>Belonging to the Marine Admiral Fujitora, this Paramecia type allows him to alter the properties of gravity, making him an extremely powerful and versatile adversary to go up against.      </li>      </ul><p>      <strong><em>One Piece </em></strong>can be streamed on Crunchyroll.   </p><p>      <strong>MORE: </strong>Dragon Ball: Gohan's Masenko, Explained  </p><span data-embed-id="c6b30e2101144d25807bbf586f39ed35">   </span><p class="display-card-description">One Piece is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda.
