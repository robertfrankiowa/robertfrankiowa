    <main><h1>The 15 Best Retinol Body Lotions to Smooth Skin From the Neck Down</h1><h2>Ultra Renewing Retinol Body Cream</h2><p>Housed in airless-pump packaging, this lightweight body cream contains encapsulated retinol, which gradually releases to address fine lines, sun spots, and help tighten skin. It also has antioxidant-rich pomegranate extract and omega-rich acai, making it a proverbial smoothie of skin-softening goodness.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"This body cream is super moisturizing and non-greasy. Very pleased with my skin’s appearance!" —Brenda</p><h2>Software Update</h2><p>If you prefer a consistency that absorbs quickly, try this: In addition to 0.25 percent pure retinol, this silky serum features 5 percent niacinamide and 3 percent glycerin to deeply hydrate as it softens the look of wrinkles and uneven tone.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"I saw visible results after a week. My skin felt instantly smoother and skin tone more even. I had even better results after a shave or exfoliation." —Wendy</p><figure><img title="Software Update" src="IMG/BB1jz09U_software_update.jpg" alt="Software Update"><figcaption><em>Software Update. softservices.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Resurfacing Body Compound</h2><p>Less of a lotion and more its own category of treatment, the U Beauty Resurfacing Body Compound addresses dullness, rough texture, and lax skin—as well as fine lines. Let it sink in a while to let it do its thing before layering anything thicker on top. </p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"Like having an option for the body that performs like the compound for the face. I went to get a pedicure and the nail technician commented on how great my legs looked (which was a first!) so I guess it’s working! Would definitely buy again. I love the brand!" —Stacey</p><figure><img title="Resurfacing Body Compound" src="IMG/AA1hDpOF_resurfacing_body_compound.jpg" alt="Resurfacing Body Compound"><figcaption><em>Resurfacing Body Compound. dermstore.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Supermatcha Body Lotion+</h2><p>This lotion is loaded with good-for-skin ingredients like antioxidant-packed matcha, anti-inflammatory turmeric, and hydrating snow mushroom. Plus, it contains rambutan, a retinol-like firming ingredient without risk of irritation. </p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"I have always had dry skin and since turning 50 it’s been tougher to find something that works. I had very low expectations for this but to my surprise it is better than any lotion or cream I’ve tried! I so happy to be able to simplify my skin routine with this product." —Kerry T</p><h2>Press Restart Gentle Retinol Body Lotion</h2><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"After I finished my first tube, I ordered two more!! My skin looks better then it ever has in the last 10 years. It soaks into the skin and leaves a silky feel. My hubby even tried it and loved it on his rough skin!" —JacquelineK56</p><figure><img title="Press Restart Gentle Retinol Body Lotion" src="IMG/AA1e5TYu_press_restart_gentle_retinol_body_lotion.jpg" alt="Press Restart Gentle Retinol Body Lotion"><figcaption><em>Press Restart Gentle Retinol Body Lotion. target.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Skin-Renewing Retinol Body Lotion</h2><p>With emollients including allantoin and shea butter, you would never know this rich, creamy lotion contains an encapsulated retinol complex to help firm skin. That is until you start noticing the results, which reviewers rave about.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"This is my second purchase. I have entered my 50s and found that my skin is starting to have that "crepey" texture, especially on my neck. I have started putting this lotion on my whole body straight out of the shower from my neck down and I love it. My skin feels super soft all the time (even on days I skip). The retinol is not irritating at all. It goes on smoothly, and spreads easily. It doesn't take long to soak in and you feel the difference right away."</p><h2>All In All Melting Body Balm</h2><p>Sea fennel extract is a retinol alternative in this formula, helping speed up collagen production while northern truffle mushroom and shea butter moisturize. The unique texture—sort of like a solid body oil that melts on contact—also feels incredible.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"This has been working miracles on my cracked hands and feet without leaving an uncomfortable residue behind. It absorbs so easily into the skin, has a pleasant but not overwhelming fragrance, and leaves my hands feeling SO soft." —Amberlat</p><h2>Beija Flor Collagen-Boosting Elasti-Cream</h2><p>Fans of Sol de Janeiro's popular firming body creams may not realize this particular jar actually contains cacay oil, a bio-retinol, plus vegan collagen and squalane to plump and hydrate skin. Like all the brand's products, the scent—a fruity-floral–is completely transportive.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"Smells so good, I prefer this scent to switch it up from the original. It’s a fresh floral scent, not to overpowering & the product itself is hydrating, absorbs quickly, & leaves my skin soft & glowing." —ashtowns</p><h2>The Body Retinol</h2><p>Retinol can only work as long as it penetrates the skin's surface, so this formula contains 10 percent AHAs (mandelic and glycolic acids) to gently slough off dead skin cells. The serum is<em> so</em> rich with active ingredients, the brand lets you know ahead of time that it has a chemically scent. </p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"Dear Necessaire: THANK YOU. I’m 50. I have firmer tights and arms combined with exercise. For the first time I see results. Keep at it! This WORKS. Fragrance does not help skin: Yes to active ingredients!" —losangelesbelle</p><h2>Retinol Skin-Smoothing Body Treatment</h2><p>Somewhere between a serum and a lotion, this treatment has 0.1 percent retinol to uneven skin tone, dullness, and help firm skin with each use. And while it may be lightweight, it packs a hydrating punch thanks to grapeseed oil, shea butter, glycerin, and dimethicone.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"I've been using these products for months now and I can tell you that it has made a difference in the softness of my skin as well as faded some dark spots that I've had. Will keep purchasing." —ABS</p><h2>Wake Up Beautiful Retinoid Body Lotion</h2><p>This affordable lotion contains a gentle retinoid to smooth skin without irritation, while vitamin E, sunflower, and avocado oils make for a soothing base. The twist, however, is melatonin, which acts as an antioxidant as skin repairs itself overnight. </p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"I bought this earlier this month. LOVE! I can already notice a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I've been using for a fews days on my legs mostly. I had bumpy KP skin. Love my legs with this!!" —MicheleRyan</p><h2>Retinol Body Cream</h2><p>For those with sensitive skin who still want to go for a true retinol, this formula has a lower concentration (0.5 percent) than most. It's also cushioned with ceramide NP, squalane, and shea butter for a major moisture boost. </p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong></p><p>"I tried this amazing body cream with retinol. The texture of this cream was thick, but it absorbed instantly into my skin. I noticed my body was left softer, brighter and smoother. I use it all over my body before bed." —linxoxo1</p><figure><img title="Retinol Body Cream" src="IMG/BB1jz2SY_retinol_body_cream.jpg" alt="Retinol Body Cream"><figcaption><em>Retinol Body Cream. target.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Whipped Argan Pro-Retinol Body Butter</h2><p>All of Josie Maran's super-rich, argan-forward body butters are incredible for dry skin. This version has added pro-retinol (derived from pink algae) for added smoothing benefits.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"This body cream is a treat I get for myself. It makes my dry skin super soft. I have hyperpigmentation, and I feel like it makes my skin color look more even. Love!" —Brianna J.</p><h2>Slather Exfoliating Body Serum with Retinol and AHAs</h2><p>Reviewers swear by this exfoliating body serum for their keratosis pilaris (a.k.a. KP). In addition to encapsulated retinol, it has lactic and glycolic acids to resurface, as well as ingredient-of-the-moment urea for hydration.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"This product quite literally cured my KP after a few uses. I’ve always been very insecure of my upper arms because of the spots and bumps. I’ve been using this for over a year now and LOVE IT!!" —callie977</p><h2>Retinol Body Lotion</h2><p>Elasticity, stretch marks, dark spots, cellulite—this creamy lotion addresses it all, thanks to a trusty combination of ingredients including hydrating glycerin, energizing caffeine, ceramides, shea butter, and of course, retinol.</p><p><strong>Customer Review:</strong></p><p>"I’ve been using this for a few weeks and my skin feels so soft and smooth. No sensitivity so far. Really helping with the dry skin I usually have in winter. Will definitely buy again." –M.A.B.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h2>How long does retinol body lotion take to work?</h2><p>Like most products, it takes a bit of time to see results. "With consistent use, you can start to see results from an over-the-counter body retinol within a few weeks," says Hartman.</p><h2>What skin types can use a retinol body lotion?</h2><p>As opposed to simply moisturizing skin, "A retinol body lotion is ideal for anyone with uneven skin tone and texture or anyone who is looking to tone up the firmness of their skin across the body," says Hartman.</p><p>According to the derm, "nearly all skin types" can use a retinol body lotion. "If you’ve ever had irritation from a retinol product on the face, start on a small section of the body before applying all over," explains the derm, adding that "Skin on the body is typically less sensitive on the face, so you may be able to use a retinol body product." </p><p>Those who are pregnant or nursing should not use products containing retinol, however you may be able to use retinol alternative ingredients. Always consult with your doctor before starting a new regimen.</p><h2>Should you adjust your body care routine when using a retinol body lotion?</h2><p>Retinol body lotions can be applied day or night. However, this is the time to be extra cognizant of SPF application. "Retinol makes the skin more susceptible to UV rays, so always wear sunscreen when you incorporate a body lotion retinol—even if you only apply it at night," advises Hartman.</p><h2>Meet the Experts</h2><p>Dr. Corey L.
