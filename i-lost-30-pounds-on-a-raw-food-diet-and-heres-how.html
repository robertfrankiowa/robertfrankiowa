    <main><h1>I Lost 30 Pounds on a Raw Food Diet and Here's How</h1><p>TikTok influencer Zara lost 30 pounds in two months on a raw vegan food diet. While health professionals don't encourage eliminating whole food groups, including more vegetables and fruits in your diet is beneficial for health and wellness. "None of these meals were cooked, it may look cooked, but no, they have been marinated and eaten raw," Zara says. Here's what she eats every day on her diet—and as she points out, it's not just salads and fruits!</p><h2>1 Smoothie Bowl</h2><p>Zara loves making smoothie bowls with bananas, mangos, and pineapple. "[Bananas are] full of nutrients and easy on the gut," registered dietitian Elyse Homan, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "Very few people have problems digesting bananas."</p><h2>2 Avocado Salad</h2><p>Zara enjoys avocado salad with tomatoes, red onion, and greens. "You might've heard that avocados are high in fat — and that's true, but it doesn't mean you should avoid them!" says the Cleveland Clinic. "A medium avocado has 22 grams of fat, which includes 15 grams of monounsaturated fats, aka 'good' fats."</p><h2>3 Okra Stew</h2><p>Zara loves making her own okra stew, which is packed with fiber. "Okra is an easy addition to stews or any other hearty vegetable dish that uses vegetables like potatoes or carrots," registered dietitian ​Sereen Zawahri Krasuna, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "And don't worry about removing the seeds because you can eat them."</p><figure><img title="3 Okra Stew" src="IMG/BB1nbNOa_3_okra_stew.jpg" alt="3 Okra Stew"><figcaption><em>3 Okra Stew. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Jerk Mushroom Burger</h2><p>Zara enjoys red-meat-alternative burgers made from mushrooms. "Mushrooms make an excellent substitute for red meat while minimizing calories, fat, and cholesterol," says UCLA Health. "Research shows that shiitake mushrooms, in particular, help to keep cholesterol levels low."</p><figure><img title="4 Jerk Mushroom Burger" src="IMG/AA1nRyRi_4_jerk_mushroom_burger.jpg" alt="4 Jerk Mushroom Burger"><figcaption><em>4 Jerk Mushroom Burger. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Kelp Noodles</h2><p>Zara makes her own alfredo pasta with kelp noodles. "Unlike plants that receive their nutrients from root structures, kelp absorbs vitamins and minerals from its surroundings – it is a good source of iodine, potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium, vitamin K, B vitamins, iron, zinc, and omega 3 fatty acids," Integris Health writes.</p><h2>6 Walnut Meat Burger</h2><p>Zara makes raw walnut burgers and uses mushrooms instead of a bun. "Walnuts are a great source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid that is important for reducing inflammation," according to UC Davis Health. "In fact, it is the only nut significantly high in these omega-3 fatty acids. Their anti-inflammatory compounds may reduce the risk of heart disease."</p><figure><img title="6 Walnut Meat Burger" src="IMG/BB1nbHBu_6_walnut_meat_burger.jpg" alt="6 Walnut Meat Burger"><figcaption><em>6 Walnut Meat Burger. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Hemp Caesar Salad</h2><p>Zara has a go-to Caesar salad made with hemp, greens, and fiber-and-antioxidant-packed red onion. "Gut bacteria break down insoluble or undigested fiber, causing fermentation," Gillian Culbertson, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "In this way, onions serve as a prebiotic or food source for the bacteria, which aids digestion."</p><h2>8 Mushroom and Cauliflower Scramble</h2><p>Zara enjoys raw vegan mushroom and cauliflower curry scramble. "Cauliflower has vitamin C, which helps heal cuts and wounds," according to UNL Food. "It also has folate, which is important for women who are pregnant, as it plays an important role in preventing birth defects."</p><h2>9 Coconut Water and Melon</h2><p>Zara makes her own breakfast juice with coconut water and fresh melon. Coconut water is a refreshing choice for homemade juice. "Because of the electrolytes some studies indicate that it can help with hydration specifically related to exercise," Maxine Smith, RDN, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic.</p><h2>10 Lettuce Wraps</h2><p>Zara makes delicious lettuce wraps with mushrooms and tomatoes. "People often underestimate the nutritional value of lettuce," registered dietitian Susan Campbell, RD, LD, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "But as a leafy green, it's just as good for you as kale or spinach."</p><h2>11 Seaweed Wraps</h2><p>Zara enjoys seaweed wraps with ocean vegetables. "Adding seaweed to the diet may have several health benefits, including improving thyroid function, digestive health, and weight loss," Victoria Whittington, RDN, tells Signos Health.</p><h2>12 Kale Chips</h2><p>Zara makes homemade kale chips. "Kale is a nutrition superstar due to the amounts of vitamins A, B6, C, K, folate, fiber, carotenoids, and manganese it contains," Caitlin Terpstra, RDN, LD, tells Mayo Clinic Health System. "One cup of raw kale has just 20 calories."</p><figure><img title="12 Kale Chips" src="IMG/BB1nbAnc_12_kale_chips.jpg" alt="12 Kale Chips"><figcaption><em>12 Kale Chips. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>13 Pistachio Pie</h2><p>Zara makes a raw pistachio pie for her dessert. "Pistachios have 13 grams of fat per serving, the majority of which (11.5 grams) comes from heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats," says the Cleveland Clinic. "Studies have shown that adding pistachios to a healthy diet may help to lower levels of oxidized-LDL (bad) cholesterol."</p><h2>14 Granola Bars</h2><p>Granola bars are part of Zara's raw food regimen. Granola is a convenient, easy-to-store snack for on-the-go. The fiber in granola can help keep you full.</p><h2>15 Chickpea Stew</h2><p>Zara loves making jerk chickpea stew. Chickpeas are a great source of non-animal protein. "That's why they reap a ton of health benefits," Patricia Bridget Lane, RDN, LDN, tells the Cleveland Clinic. "These little tiny peas are just packed with nutrition." And if you enjoyed this article, take advantage of these 15 Quick Ways to Lose Body Fat Percentage in a Week.</p></main>
