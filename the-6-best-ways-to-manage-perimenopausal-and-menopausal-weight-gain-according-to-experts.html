But sometimes, talking about the big M, which most women experience between 45 and 52, can feel like you’re back in Sex Ed, with more questions than answers. It’s important to educate yourself on what to expect during perimenopause and menopause, because symptoms can sneak up while you’re still getting your period. One of the biggest (and peskiest) is weight gain.</p><p>“Natural menopause typically occurs in your mid-40s, around the same time that women may notice changes in their ability to control their weight,” says Elizabeth Ward, MS, RDN, co-author of <em>The Menopause Diet Plan: A Natural Guide to Managing Hormones, Health and Happiness</em>. </p><p>While it’s hard to determine if menopause, aging, or a sedentary lifestyle is to blame, menstrual cycle changes mean declining estrogen levels, which is associated with increased belly fat, Ward says. (It’s not totally clear <em>why</em> this happens, but, on average, belly fat increases from 5 to 8 percent of total body fat during the premenopausal phase, and 15 to 25 percent afterward, one study found.)</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can still manage your weight with tried-and-true tactics. “There aren’t any ‘hacks’ for long-term weight loss,” notes Neil Paulvin, DO, a board-certified family medicine and regenerative medicine doctor. “Overall, it's important to intentionally change your habits as your body changes within."</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts:</strong> Elizabeth Ward, MS, is a registered dietician nutritionist and a co-author of <em>The Menopause Diet Plan</em><em>. </em>Neil Paulvin, DO, is a board-certified family medicine and regenerative medicine doctor.

The experts here have tips to help you feel your best, strongest, and most confident self during this transformative stage of life.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Up your protein intake.</strong></h2><p>Once you hit perimenopause, you'll likely need to change up your diet. As women age, their bodies don’t handle protein as efficiently, so it's best to start increasing your intake. “Protein is important to make and preserve muscle tissue, which is a metabolic powerhouse that protects against several chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes,” says Ward. Plus, protein helps you feel fuller longer. </p><p>A sedentary, 150-pound woman should consume roughly 55 grams of protein per day, or about 18 grams per meal. Ultimately, if you want to see the numbers on the scale return to your baseline, up your protein intake.</p><p><strong>“</strong>The ideal eating plan at this stage of life is typically higher in protein—at least 25 to 30 grams at every meal and seven to 10 grams in snacks," says Ward. Also think about watching your intake of foods with simple carbohydrates like chips, ice cream, and cookies, and eat a diet rich in fiber (about 30 grams a day) and with moderate amounts of healthy fats, she adds. </p><p>Not all protein is created equal. Ward suggests adding in lean sources of animal protein, which tend to be richer in leucine, a muscle-building amino acid. “You need leucine and adequate protein in the diet to make and preserve muscle tissue, which also provides a somewhat greater calorie burn 24/7,” says Ward. </p><p>But upping protein also means scaling back elsewhere. “When you add more protein, you need to cut back on carbs, fat, or both, and it usually works out that women are [already] eating too many carbs and fats and not enough protein,” says Ward. “You can't just add protein because it will probably result in weight gain or no weight loss.” </p><h2 class="body-h2">Strength train and lift weights to burn more at rest. </h2><p>Strength training is the one of the best things you can do to boost your metabolism and prevent perimenopausal and menopausal weight gain, according to fitness trainer and coach Marissa Roy, owner of Permanent Change Coaching. Your muscle proteins have estrogen receptors, so as estrogen levels decline, you need extra strength training to maintain your muscles. Ward recommends doing strength-focused workouts at least twice per week, lifting a bit heavier and doing fewer reps. </p><p>“This doesn't need to mean pushing 300 pounds on a barbell around, but it does mean learning how to safely and effectively use weights in the gym, and train to build muscle and get stronger,” says Roy. “This will increase muscle mass, bone density, and therefore, metabolic rate, protecting the woman's metabolism against weight gain or rebounding after a weight-loss diet.”</p><p>You can also boost your metabolism by following the "progressive overload" principal, or gradually increasing the weight and reps in your routine, Roy explains. </p><p>Just getting started? Know your baseline and build up to a new target. If you’re a total newbie, you might even opt for a session or two with a trainer at your gym. Ideally, Roy recommends starting with roughly six to 15 reps to build up your muscle strength. “The most important factor is making sure that you progress week-by-week, and you're actually getting stronger,” he says. </p><h2>Focus on micro-movements that target your core.</h2><p>Certain types of activity may be more beneficial for your body once you hit perimenopause and start moving into menopause. “Think low-impact cardio, with more focus on micro-movements to really target the deep core and keep the articulations strong and flexible," says Melie Purdon, a yoga instructor with YogaRenew Teacher Training.</p><p>Targeting your midsection during a workout can be tricky, but Purdon says the micro-movements and abdominal breathwork in yoga or Pilates can be super beneficial, targeting deep core muscles that aren’t always activated.</p><p>“When you use all the muscles that are part of a well-rounded breath, you target the transverse abdominis, which are the deepest layer of abdominals,” says Purdon.</p><p>The key is building strength from the inside out—which benefits everything from breathing patterns, to back pain and posture, Purdon continues. "You will be more efficient in your other types of workout and begin to see results in the shape of your belly.”</p><h2 class="body-h2">Take workouts slow and steady.</h2><p>You shouldn't go from couch hero to treadmill queen in one day. Roy has been working with menopausal women since 2016, and she says suddenly throwing yourself into a bootcamp or intense HIIT class isn't the answer to menopausal weight gain.</p><p>You might hurt yourself if you put your body through these types of workouts without proper prep. “When sex hormones tank and menopause hits, it becomes incredibly easy for women to lose muscle mass and become prone to breaking bones, falls, and aging quicker,” says Roy. </p><p>If you're looking for a little cardio boost, try incorporating mini-movement breaks during your day. Think walking around your block or doing jumping jacks between episodes of <em>Ted Lasso</em>. “It's not always enough to go to the gym—look for ways to ‘snack’ on exercise throughout the day, such as taking five minutes out of every hour to move around,” says Ward.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Speak with your doc about a vitamin D supplement. </strong></h2><p>As it turns out, keeping pounds off may be linked with maintaining adequate vitamin D levels, because low vitamin D levels are related to the suppression of a hormone that fights fat accumulation. So, Ward says it’s crucial for women to get 15 micrograms every day.</p><p>It's hard to hit recommended vitamin D levels through diet alone, especially as you age, so Ward also suggests looking into supplements. </p><p>Note: The science world is not <em>totally</em> on the same page about this vitamin. A 2020 review of 20 randomized controlled trials showed that vitamin D supplementation had no effect on BMI or waist circumference in healthy adults, even those considered overweight or obese. </p><p>Again, it’s all about what works for you and understanding that weight loss does not have one magic bullet solution. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>Prioritize sleep.</strong></h2><p>A solid sleep cycle is essential to reaching most health goals, and weight control—especially during perimenopause and menopause—is no exception. “When you sleep poorly, it's hard to muster the energy to plan healthy meals and to exercise because you're just too tired,” says Ward. </p><p>Unfortunately, perimenopause and menopause symptoms (like hot flashes) can make good sleep difficult. But there are ways to set yourself up for success. First, avoid sugary foods at night, Ward says. Yes, a scoop of late-night ice cream really hits the spot when <em>Succession</em> comes on, but you process carbohydrates better earlier in the day, and sweets after dinner can spike blood glucose levels, making it harder to fall asleep.</p><p>Second, pay attention to your natural melatonin levels. The "sleepy" hormone is actually present in cherries, grapes, strawberries, salmon, eggs, legumes, pistachios, peppers, and mushrooms, so Ward says you can increase your supply by incorporating these foods into your diet.</p><p>Ultimately, your body is working hard to transition you to a new (and exciting!) phase of life. So, don't be too hard on yourself. These tips can help you feel your strongest, but finding what works best for you may require some experimentation and willingness to try new activities, as well as personalized advice from a doctor who knows you.</p></main>
