Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>You’ve probably been lectured on the importance of breakfast since you were a kid. Almost universally, mothers want their kids to eat something before school. And even in adulthood, this attitude toward breakfast never really fades.</p><p>“Breakfast is a great way to set the tone for your day,” says Sarah Wagner, MPH, RD, of Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston. “A morning meal gives you the opportunity to really fuel yourself for everything you have to do that day.” This might be why 84.4 percent of American adults eat breakfast, according to a survey.</p><p>But is breakfast that important for reaching and maintaining a healthy weight?</p><p>People have debated the role of breakfast in weight loss for decades. Some think breakfast is a must because it jump-starts your metabolism and prevents overeating later in the day. Others argue that skipping breakfast can be an easy way to achieve a calorie deficit, as long as you still get the nutrition you need throughout the rest of the day. Even the scientists who have studied the topic and registered dietitians aren’t always on the same page.</p><h2>What the Science Says About Breakfast and Weight Loss</h2><p>Unfortunately, the research on breakfast’s role in weight loss is mixed and contradictory. One study found that skipping dinner, not breakfast, was associated with overweight and obesity. But another study found that skipping breakfast was associated with negative metabolic outcomes, including obesity. And a third study found that eating a big breakfast rather than a large dinner may prevent obesity and high blood sugar.</p><p>“Nutrition research is hard because the highest quality study would require participants to live in a bubble, but people don't actually live in bubbles,” says Wagner. Kids’ schedules, missed alarms, morning meetings, and other conflicting priorities all get in the way of morning meals in the real world.</p><p>Plus, every human body is different. “The mixed results regarding breakfast and weight loss suggest that the impact of breakfast might be highly individual and vary significantly based on specific circumstances and energy needs,” says Martha Theran, RDN, of Pritikin Longevity Center in Miami.</p><p>When it comes to science, the best information probably comes from meta-analyses, which are studies of the whole body of research on a topic. In one such meta-analysis, researchers found a strong link between skipping breakfast and having an overweight or obese body mass index (BMI). It’s important to note that BMI isn’t a direct measure of health and more research is needed. One potential explanation for this finding is that skipping breakfast seems to increase food consumption at other times of the day, leading to overeating.</p><h2>Skipping Meals and Intermittent Fasting</h2><p>As long as people have been trying to lose weight, they have skipped meals, including breakfast, to cut calories. Today, that practice often takes the form of intermittent fasting, a diet that requires you to limit eating to a specific time window, such as 8 or 12 hours.</p><p>Wagner says that some of her clients practice intermittent fasting as a weight loss strategy, with mixed results. Many people start their eating window at noon.</p><p>“For some people, having the clock determine when to eat and when not to eat is very helpful. For others, it's not,” says Wagner. “If your main source of excess calories is late-night ice cream or donuts before lunch, then intermittent fasting can discourage that.”</p><p>Some science supports intermittent fasting. One large meta-analysis found an association between intermittent fasting and a modest reduction of body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults categorized as overweight or obese. “Other research indicates that for some, skipping breakfast can lead to overeating later in the day, poorer diet quality, and reduced energy levels,” notes Theran.</p><h2>What if You Aren’t Hungry?</h2><p>When it comes to weight loss, people often insist you shouldn’t eat if you aren’t hungry — but also say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. So what do you do if you aren’t hungry in the morning?</p><p>Dietitians suggest investigating why that might be. “Lack of hunger in the morning might suggest late-night eating or eating dinner too close to bedtime. Addressing meal timing can help regulate morning hunger and improve overall eating patterns,” says Theran.</p><p>If you’ve eliminated late-night snacks and set a dinnertime that’s three hours or more before bedtime, and you’re still not hungry when you wake up, don’t force it, says Wagner. You can still call a meal “breakfast” if you eat it within a couple of hours of getting out of bed. And even if you can’t stomach a bite before noon, it’s okay. “Focus on maintaining a balanced and healthy diet throughout the rest of the day,” says Theran.</p><h2>What You Eat Is More Important Than When You Eat It</h2><p>Breakfast has a well-earned reputation for aiding weight loss. In general, both Wagner and Theran recommend eating breakfast to their clients. “It prevents blood sugar imbalances, it can reduce hunger throughout the day, and it seems to promote better choices the rest of the day as well,” says Theran.</p><p>Still, both emphasize that not all morning meals are equal. “The most important factor is the quality of your breakfast food. Eating a breakfast high in refined sugars and low in nutrients, like Pop-Tarts or pastries, can lead to spikes and crashes in blood sugar, increased hunger, and subsequent overeating,” says Theran.</p><p>“I recommend protein and color at your meals. Have eggs with vegetables mixed in. If you want oatmeal, try it with fruit, nuts, and Greek yogurt,” says Wagner.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>The importance of breakfast for weight loss varies by person. The majority of the research and dietitians support it. But if you routinely eat a fast-food sandwich or sugary pastries, you may be better off skipping breakfast. If you start your day with a meal packed with protein and fiber, you will likely set yourself up for weight loss success.</p><p>“Nutrient-dense breakfasts provide sustained energy, keep hunger at bay, and aid in weight management by providing essential nutrients and promoting satiety,” says Theran.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
