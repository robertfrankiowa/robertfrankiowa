So for me right now, that's anywhere between 7,000 to 10,000 steps per day," she says.</p><h2>2 Make Sure You Actually Enjoy Walking</h2><p>Briana also stresses the importance of actually liking walking. "So whatever workout you're doing, you have to make sure that it's something that you like. Because you can see results doing anything. I love walking because I feel like it's slimmed down my whole body, my arms, my legs, my stomach, everything," she says.</p><h2>3 Have Something To Do While Walking</h2><p>"With that being said, you also want to make sure that you have something to do while you're walking, because I know sometimes it can get a little bit boring, especially if you're going for a long period of time," she says. This could be listening to music or a podcast, or chatting with a friend. If you are walking on a treadmill, you could watch a show.</p><h2>4 Be Consistent</h2><p>"However long you decide to walk, however many steps you're trying to hit, just make sure that you're trying to be consistent with it, and you're giving yourself that time to prioritize your health every single day," says Briana. "Also, with modeling too, I feel like walking has really helped me achieve the look that I'm going for because like I said, it slims everything all at once."</p><figure><img title="4 Be Consistent" src="IMG/BB1mIaj1_4_be_consistent.jpg" alt="4 Be Consistent"><figcaption><em>4 Be Consistent. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Science Supports Walking for Weight Loss</h2><p>Briana is right about walking and weight loss, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Obesity. Researchers found a link between walking 10,000 steps a day and weight loss and weight management. Other studies published by the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) in JAMA Neurology and in JAMA Internal Medicine also linked walking 10,000 steps a day to less dementia and less cardiovascular disease overall, with less heart disease, less heart failure and fewer strokes.</p><figure><img title="5 Science Supports Walking for Weight Loss" src="IMG/BB1nkhEN_5_science_supports_walking_for_weight_loss.jpg" alt="5 Science Supports Walking for Weight Loss"><figcaption><em>5 Science Supports Walking for Weight Loss. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Walking Is Good for Your Heart and Helps to Prevent Cancer</h2><p>The Mayo Clinic endorses regular brisk walking, explaining that it can help you maintain a healthy weight and lose body fat. It can also prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2>7 There Are Many Other Benefits of Walking</h2><p>It can also help improve cardiovascular fitness, strengthen your bones and muscles, improve muscle endurance, increase energy levels, improve your mood, cognition, memory, and sleep, improve your balance and coordination, strengthen your immune system, and reduce stress and tension.</p><figure><img title="7 There Are Many Other Benefits of Walking" src="IMG/AA1nYADd_7_there_are_many_other_benefits_of_walking.jpg" alt="7 There Are Many Other Benefits of Walking"><figcaption><em>7 There Are Many Other Benefits of Walking. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Even Walking 10 Minutes a Day Will Help</h2><p>Can't take a long walk? Chris McMahon, a nutrition and fitness coach, suggests taking 10-minute walks whenever you can. "A 10-minute walk is equal to a thousand steps. So if you think of it that way, it's like, "Oh, okay, I can take short little walk breaks," he tells Body Network.
