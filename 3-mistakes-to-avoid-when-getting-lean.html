    <main><h1>3 Mistakes to Avoid When Getting Lean</h1><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of Americans try to lose weight every year. According to an Everyday Health survey, 79 percent of people believed that reaching their target weight would make them "happier." However, Alexandra Redmond, a fitness influencer with over 431,00 followers on Instagram, is living, breathing proof that leaner isn't always. In an Instagram post, Redmond reveals that being super lean isn't necessarily the key to happiness.</p><figure><img title="3 Mistakes to Avoid When Getting Lean" src="IMG/AA1nVkqf_3_mistakes_to_avoid_when_getting_lean.jpg" alt="3 Mistakes to Avoid When Getting Lean"><figcaption><em>3 Mistakes to Avoid When Getting Lean. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 Why I Gave Up on Getting Lean and Found My Happy Medium</h2><p>"Unless you have the genetics, achieving this level of leanness requires more sacrifice than the average person is willing to give," she wrote in the caption of the post. "I used to think that if I looked the part and was 'shredded,' people would trust me more; I'd be happier and more 'credible.' What it actually did was mess with my mental and physical health and had me focusing more on my imperfections than ever," she admits. "I think everyone has a 'happy medium' where they feel their best, can enjoy foods they love, AND feel good in their body."</p><h2>2 The Hidden Costs of Having Abs</h2><p>In the video, which she titled "Things I Wish I Knew Before Getting This Lean," she explains that while "having abs might be cool," there are also disadvantages of being at such a low body fat percent. For one, it "can actually hurt your hormone health," she says. </p><figure><img title="2 The Hidden Costs of Having Abs" src="IMG/AA1nVkqf_2_the_hidden_costs_of_having_abs.jpg" alt="2 The Hidden Costs of Having Abs"><figcaption><em>2 The Hidden Costs of Having Abs. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Being Lean Ruined My Happiness</h2><p>And, "being this lean" did not bring her any more happiness than she had at a higher body fat percentage. "I thought it would help my body image, but it actually made me fixate more on my imperfections than ever," she confessed.</p><figure><img title="3 Being Lean Ruined My Happiness" src="IMG/AA1nAiFb_3_being_lean_ruined_my_happiness.jpg" alt="3 Being Lean Ruined My Happiness"><figcaption><em>3 Being Lean Ruined My Happiness. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 She Sacrficed Her Social Life</h2><p>She also had to sacrifice her social life. "If I went out to eat with my family or friends, I would actually pack my own food," she said. "This level of leanness is not sustainable, and it certainly didn't make me a more qualified coach," she concluded.</p><figure><img title="4 She Sacrficed Her Social Life" src="IMG/AA1nVgqk_4_she_sacrficed_her_social_life.jpg" alt="4 She Sacrficed Her Social Life"><figcaption><em>4 She Sacrficed Her Social Life. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 A Study Reveals the Surprising Link Between Obesity and Happiness</h2><p>Research has found that while weight loss can come with mental health benefits, seriously restricting or avoiding foods can lead to disorders and psychological problems. In fact, a study published in the <em>International Journal of Epidemiology</em> found that people who are obese are generally happier than those who are thin and also have a calmer state of mind.</p><h2>6 Finding Your Happy Medium</h2><p>This doesn't mean you are better off being obese, as obesity is linked to a number of health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. As Redmond mentions, a "happy medium," a weight where you feel healthy but not deprived, is the ideal goal.
