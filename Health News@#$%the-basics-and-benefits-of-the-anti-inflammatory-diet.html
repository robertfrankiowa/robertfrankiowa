To see if it might be right for you, there are a few things to know first. Let’s dive in!</p><figure><img title="Provided by MomsWhoSave" src="IMG/AA12BuUq_anti_inflammatory_diet.jpg" alt="anti-inflammatory diet"><figcaption><em>anti-inflammatory diet.

Even though our bodies use inflammation to fight off sickness or repair a wound, it’s still an indication that something is wrong. And when inflammation occurs when it shouldn’t and refuses to go away, inflammation itself is a problem.</p><p>How problematic is the wrong kind of inflammation? Here’s a rundown:</p><ul><li>It’s harmful to your gut</li><li>It’s harmful to your joints</li><li>It’s harmful to your heart</li><li>It’s harmful to your sleep</li><li>It’s harmful to your gums</li><li>It’s harmful to your lungs</li><li>It’s harmful to your bones</li><li>It’s harmful to your skin</li><li>It’s harmful to your weight</li><li>It’s harmful to your mental health</li><li>It can cause cancer</li></ul><p>Now the burning question is, what do we do about unhealthy, chronic inflammation? Diet plays a huge role in inflammation issues (activity level and stress also contribute, but significantly less so). Plenty of studies have found that foods that are highly processed, fried, or full of saturated and trans fats cause the problem. A diet rich in fruits, veggies, whole grains, and healthy fats can actually reduce the problem. </p><h2><strong>The Basics of the Anti-Inflammatory Diet</strong></h2><p>Enter the Anti-Inflammatory Diet. The goal? To reduce chronic inflammation. The method? Eating a diet made up of healthy proteins, healthy fats, and healthy carbohydrates. You can also incorporate ginger into your diet and supplement with turmeric (with a doctor’s approval).</p><h3>Healthy Proteins:</h3><p>Avoid red, fatty meat and dairy products. Instead opt for beans, lentils, walnuts, pistachios, pine nuts, almonds, and cold water fish.</p><h3>Healthy Fats:</h3><p>Avoid fried foods, soybean/vegetable oils, and sugary processed foods. Instead opt for coconut and avocado and their oils, and the various nuts and fish listed above.</p><p>Avoid white breads and pastas, and instead opt for nutrient dense fruits and veggies.</p><h2><strong>The Benefits of the Anti-Inflammatory Diet</strong></h2><p>The list of potential problems above makes it pretty clear how beneficial the anti-inflammatory diet could be. While there haven’t been extensive studies done to prove whether or not this diet will fix many of these issues, there’s plenty of science and experience that contributes to the possibility. Let’s break it down just a little bit. By implementing the anti-inflammatory diet, you <em>could</em>:</p><ul><li>Feel less bloated</li><li>Have less achy joints</li><li>Protect your arteries</li><li>Enjoy deeper sleep</li><li>Spend less time at the dentist</li><li>Have more stamina</li><li>Strengthen brittle bones</li><li>Clear up your skin</li><li>Lose some weight</li><li>Improve your mood</li><li>Fight cancer before it starts</li></ul><p>The anti-inflammatory diet can’t promise you perfect health, but it can get you well on your way to significantly improved health. If you think you may have chronic inflammation issues, talk to your doctor about implementing this diet. We have one body and one life.
