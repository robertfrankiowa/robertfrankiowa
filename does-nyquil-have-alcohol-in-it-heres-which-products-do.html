Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Which NyQuil Products Have Alcohol?</h2><p>NyQuil is an OTC brand for managing colds and flu. It is available in different formulations and combinations of different active ingredients.</p><p>A majority of NyQuil products contain alcohol in their formulations. Some common brands include:</p><ul><li>NyQuil VapoCool Severe Cold & Flu Liquid + Congestion</li><li>NyQuil Cold & Flu Nighttime Relief Liquid</li><li>NyQuil HBP Cold and Flu Medicine</li></ul><h2>Alcohol-Free NyQuil Products</h2><p>Along with alcohol-containing NyQuil products on the market, there are a few exemptions. Some NyQuil products do not contain alcohol, and these include:</p><ul><li>Vicks NyQuil Alcohol-Free Cold and Flu Nighttime relief</li><li>NyQuil Cold and Flu liquid</li><li>Vicks NyQuil liquid capsules</li><li>Vicks NyQuil alcohol-free cold and flu nighttime relief</li><li>Children’s NyQuil</li></ul><p>However, many alcohol-free NyQuil products may contain ingredients that still cause drowsiness. Be aware that drinking alcohol with products that contain doxylamine succinate or dextromethorphan can be dangerous.</p><h2>What Does Alcohol Do in NyQuil?</h2><p>NyQuil products usually contain 10% alcohol. However, alcohol does not have any therapeutic effect for cold or flu symptoms. It is a solvent that dissolves other ingredients in a product's formulation. </p><p><h3>Do Other Medications Contain Alcohol?</h3><p>Certain liquid-based medicines may contain up to 10% alcohol in their ingredients. Alcohol often functions as a solvent. Cough syrups and laxatives are considered to have some of the highest alcohol concentrations.</p><h2>Can You Drink Alcohol While Taking Alcohol-Containing NyQuil?</h2><p>NyQuil products containing 10% alcohol as a solvent can cause drowsiness or sedation. Therefore, you should avoid consuming alcohol with NyQuil products. It can cause unpleasant side effects, including temporary and more serious long-term effects.  </p><p>Alcohol consumption can exacerbate drowsiness and impaired attention. To prevent accidents, do not drive a vehicle or operate machinery when using NyQuil products.</p><p>Different ingredients have different durations of action and time to leave the body. For example, doxylamine takes the maximum time (over two days) to leave the system. Similarly, diphenhydramine also takes one to four days to wear off completely from the body.</p><p>Alcohol can also take up to 24 hours to clear out from the body. Therefore, it is better to avoid taking alcohol with medications that already have alcohol in them.</p><h2>Who Shouldn’t Take Alcohol-Containing NyQuil?</h2><p>NyQuil is not safe for people with liver problems. This product contains alcohol and acetaminophen, which can affect the liver if you take:</p><ul><li>More than four doses in 24 hours</li><li>With other drugs containing acetaminophen</li><li>Three or more alcoholic drinks daily while using this product</li><li>Taking or having taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in the previous two weeks</li></ul><p>Tell your healthcare provider before taking NyQuil if you have the following conditions:</p><ul><li>Glaucoma</li><li>Cough with too much phlegm (mucus)</li><li>Breathing problems or chronic cough with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema</li><li>Trouble urinating due to an enlarged prostate gland</li><li>Pregnancy or breastfeeding</li></ul><h2>Other NyQuil Ingredients</h2><p>NyQuil medications contain several different ingredients. Their active ingredients include:</p><ul><li>Acetaminophen: reduces fever and alleviates minor pain</li><li>Dextromethorphan: suppresses coughing</li><li>Doxylamine: relieves congestion, sneezing, and sore throat</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>NyQuil is an OTC medicine for the common cold and flu. Along with different active ingredients, NyQuil does have alcohol as a solvent in various products. But it also has some alcohol-free formulations.</p><p>NyQuil can cause you to feel very sleepy or drowsy. Moreover, drinking alcohol with NyQuil can even lead to liver damage. Alcohol-free NyQuil products can also cause sedative effects, though, so it's important to read the medication label for a list of ingredients.</p>
