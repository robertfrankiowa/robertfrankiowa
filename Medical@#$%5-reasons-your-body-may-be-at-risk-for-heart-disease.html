    <main><h1>5 Reasons Your Body May be at Risk for Heart Disease</h1><p>Heartdisease remains the leading killer in the United States and artery disease is the most common type. "About 20.1 million adults age 20 and older have CAD (about 7.2%)," according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. "In 2020, about 2 in 10 deaths from CAD happened in adults less than 65 years old." In addition, the CDC says the disease killed 382,820 people in 2020."</p><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) happens when the walls of the arteries are choked with plaque and can't properly perform their job of sending enough blood, oxygen and nutrients to the heart. "Unfortunately, it is hard to deny that our society is not structured in a way that leads to positive health outcomes," Dr. Tomi Mitchell, a Board-Certified Family Physician with Holistic Wellness Strategies, says. "We have shifted from an era where physical activity was essential for daily life and food was found by physical hunting and gathering to a modern age where convenience and speed are at the helm of many decisions throughout our day-to-day lives. This shift has resulted in an apparent increase in our population's heart disease and chronic illnesses."</p><p>Dr. Mitchell adds, "Though we may understand why this happens, we still lack effective strategies to combat these issues. For this reason, it is essential that, as a society, we properly address these healthcare outcomes head-on and develop a comprehensive plan for addressing them. One of these negative health outcomes is coronary artery disease." Read on to learn more about CAD and signs that indicate you have the disease. Please consult your physican for medical advice.Â </p><figure><img title="5 Reasons Your Body May be at Risk for Heart Disease" src="IMG/BB1kW6XQ_5_reasons_your_body_may_be_at_risk_for_heart_disease.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Your Body May be at Risk for Heart Disease"><figcaption><em>5 Reasons Your Body May be at Risk for Heart Disease.
