    <main><h1>Sertraline for Depression & Anxiety: Breaking Down the Side Effects</h1><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If your mental health has seemed a little out of sorts for some time now, there’s a chance you’ve already spoken to a healthcare provider and been offered the common antidepressant sertraline. Whether you have been prescribed this antidepressant medication or are just curious, you might have some questions.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline is an FDA-approved medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Sertraline is approved to treat a variety of conditions, including depression and anxiety, and, although no antidepressant works for everybody, experts generally agree that it’s one of the most effective treatments on the market today.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">So what’s the catch?</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Like all SSRIs, sertraline (often prescribed under the brand name Zoloft) comes with side effects that you should be aware of before you start taking the medication.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Below are the common early side effects of taking sertraline, as well as the rarer, more serious side effects that you may encounter. This article also touches on the long-term side effect risk of sertraline.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">You should know what to expect before taking any medication, so read on to prepare.</p><h2>Common First Week Side Effects of Sertraline</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There are a lot of reasons you may take sertraline,  a medication that can help you manage mental health disorders such as:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Panic disorder or panic attacks</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Major depressive disorder (MDD)</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Social anxiety disorder (SAD)</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In some cases, it is also prescribed (but not FDA-approved) to treat acute bipolar depression.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Regardless of why you’re taking sertraline, there’s a good chance you’ll encounter side effects in the first weeks.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Like other SSRIs, sertraline can cause a range of possible side effects that typically occur during the first few weeks of treatment, including:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Nausea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Fatigue and tiredness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Intimacy problems, specifically decreased desire and difficulty climaxing</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sleep disturbances</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dizziness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Weight gain or weight loss</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Loss of appetite</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Diarrhea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Headaches</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dry mouth</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">We’ve shared more information on these common side effects below.</p><h2>Nausea</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re nauseous while taking sertraline, just know you’re not the only one, as about one in four people experience this side effect.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The good news is that you’re most likely to experience nausea in the first week or two of taking the medication. After this, the side effect likely goes away on its own as your body adjusts.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It’s also likely that you’ll experience nausea if you abruptly stop taking sertraline, as your body goes through withdrawal symptoms. If you want to stop taking sertraline, talk to your doctor first about a timeline for tapering your dosage to avoid nausea and other side effects.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In the meantime, taking your sertraline dose with bland foods or ginger tea may help alleviate any nausea.</p><h2>Fatigue and Tiredness</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Does Zoloft make you tired? For many people, it certainly can.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It’s very common to feel a little low in energy during the first few weeks of taking sertraline, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Fatigue and drowsiness are two of the most common side effects of sertraline, and if you’re using sertraline to treat depression, fatigue and tiredness can also be compounded by the effects of depression itself.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dealing with fatigue and tiredness from sertraline can be a frustrating experience, but they usually pass over time. As the medication reaches a steady state in your body, you’ll generally start to notice a less pronounced effect on your energy levels.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">But if you have persistent fatigue or drowsiness that doesn’t disappear within one month, it’s best to contact your healthcare provider.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It’s worth noting that fatigue and tiredness are also symptoms of depression. As sertraline starts to work, you may notice a boost in your energy.</p><h2>Intimacy Problems</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline and other SSRIs can cause a variety of intimacy side effects, from difficulty climaxing to decreased drive.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">According to a review of studies published in the journal The Mental Health Clinician, between 40 percent and 65 percent of people who take an SSRI experience some side effects related to desire and performance. These side effects can affect both men and women.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In men, one of the most common side effects is difficulty climaxing. Alongside climaxing troubles, some men also experience a lower general level of interest in intimacy after using SSRIs such as sertraline, which may present as ED.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">As for the Zoloft side effect in women, the most common intimacy side effect of sertraline and other SSRIs is a lower level of interest in intimacy and difficulty climaxing.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Like many other sertraline effects, intimacy side effects can often fade over time as your body gets used to the medication. If persistent, intimacy side effects can be treated by adjusting your dosage or switching to a different medication.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">But it’s worth noting the research did find that of the SSRIs, sertraline has one of the lower likelihoods of affecting intimacy function. So if this side effect doesn’t go away, you may need to switch medication classes to something like tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs or others. Additionally, diminished interest in intimacy can be a symptom of depression. As treatment progresses and your depression eases, you may notice your drive improving and returning to its usual baseline.</p><figure><img title="Intimacy Problems" src="IMG/AA1ns1hO_intimacy_problems.jpg" alt="Intimacy Problems"><figcaption><em>Intimacy Problems. PeopleImages/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Sleep Disturbances</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Insomnia and a general reduction in sleep quality are both common side effects of SSRIs and other antidepressants. A 2017 review of research literature published in the journal Current Psychiatry Reports notes that it’s common for antidepressants to affect sleep (though it didn’t mention sertraline by name).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In particular, 17 percent of people using antidepressants experienced sleep disturbances compared to nine percent of people taking a placebo.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">People who use sertraline may find that they have trouble sleeping, or find themselves waking up frequently throughout the night. As mentioned previously, sertraline can also cause you to be more sleepy than usual.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There are several ways to deal with sleep disturbances from sertraline. The best way is simply to wait it out, as this side effect tends to fade away as the medication reaches a steady state in your body.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It’s also possible to take sertraline in the morning, so its concentration will be reduced by the time you sleep. And although this may sound obvious, you can help your chances of a good night’s rest if you avoid caffeine and other stimulants after noon.</p><figure><img title="Sleep Disturbances" src="IMG/AA1iYPeU_sleep_disturbances.jpg" alt="Sleep Disturbances"><figcaption><em>Sleep Disturbances. Depositphotos.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Dizziness</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In the long term, sertraline may actually help reduce levels of dizziness in people with chronic dizziness. Despite this, it’s not uncommon to feel dizzy during the first few weeks of using sertraline — potentially a result of lower blood pressure due to the medication (that does not mean that this is a treatment for high blood pressure, by the way).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dizziness is a short-term side effect of sertraline that usually doesn’t persist for longer than two to four weeks (and sometimes even less), but if you notice that frequent dizziness or lightheadedness lasts for more than four weeks, contact your healthcare professional to discuss a lower dose of sertraline.</p><h2>Weight Gain or Weight Loss</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline and other SSRIs are associated with weight fluctuations, although not all people who take these medications will gain or lose weight.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Most of the weight gain caused by antidepressants is mild, with a 2017 study from Australia finding that high-dosage antidepressant users gain 0.28kg (about 0.6 lbs) per year on average.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In a 2018 UK study, researchers concluded that antidepressants may contribute to a long-term increased risk of weight gain. Another study published in the journal Nutrients found that antidepressant use is associated with a higher total calorie intake.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There’s also some research out there to suggest that — at least in the short term — sertraline may actually cause you to lose weight, especially if you’re diabetic. After all, one of the other side effects is a loss of appetite (which is covered next).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">This has been noted in studies as well. In one smaller study involving 33 patients with type 2 diabetes, researchers found that participants had decreases in overall weight, body mass index and waist circumference at the end of the 12-week observation period.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re concerned about weight gain or weight loss, talk to your healthcare provider.</p><h2>Loss of Appetite</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Like other side effects of sertraline, reduced appetite is usually temporary and should wear off after the first few weeks on the medication.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The key to avoiding weight loss from sertraline is to monitor your food intake and maintain your pre-sertraline eating habits. By staying consistent with your eating habits and activity level, it’s easier to maintain your body mass and composition while using sertraline or any other SSRI.</p><h2>Diarrhea</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Unfortunately, diarrhea is a common side effect of sertraline. In comparative studies of sertraline and other SSRIs, about 14 percent of people who were prescribed sertraline at a typical dose experienced diarrhea, compared to about seven percent of those on other SSRIs, according to an article published in the journal International Clinical Psychopharmacology.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Most of the time, diarrhea becomes less frequent and disappears completely as your body adjusts to the medication and your dosage of sertraline reaches a steady state.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">This side effect, like others, may often be managed by reducing your dosage of sertraline or switching to a different antidepressant, such as escitalopram (Lexapro) or fluoxetine (Prozac), which are both less likely to cause diarrhea. If you have persistent diarrhea from sertraline, the best approach is to contact your healthcare provider.</p><h2>Headaches</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The link between sertraline and headaches is a complicated one.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">On one hand, headaches are a common side effect of the medication itself. These Zoloft headaches usually disappear after two to four weeks of use as the medication stabilizes in your body.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">On the other hand, this SSRI has also been shown to be effective in treating chronic tension-type headaches, according to a study of 50 people.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It is important to discuss what medications you’re taking with your healthcare provider before you start on sertraline.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">While some painkillers can interact with sertraline, it’s generally safe to take over-the-counter medications including Tylenol if you experience headaches after starting sertraline. But be aware that in some cases, Tylenol may interact with sertraline as they both are metabolized through your liver.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Simple changes to your sertraline usage, such as taking your medication at a different time of day or reducing your dosage, can help to limit or get rid of headaches. If you have persistent or severe headaches from sertraline that don’t improve over time, talk to your healthcare provider.</p><h2>Dry Mouth</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">While there’s no clear explanation for dry mouth, researchers believe that the effects of sertraline and other SSRIs on the brain can also affect your digestive system (one of the reasons some people report constipation or diarrhea).</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">According to the Food and Drug Administration, 14 percent of people prescribed antidepressants experience some level of dry mouth, compared to nine percent of people who take a placebo.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dry mouth should go away on its own over the course of several weeks, but it’s also possible to reduce the severity of dry mouth by avoiding caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, spicy foods and other foods and drinks that can cause dehydration.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It is also recommended that you avoid using mouthwash products that contain alcohol, as they can make the problem worse.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Just like many other side effects of sertraline, dry mouth can often be avoided by adjusting your dosage or switching to a different SSRI medication. Sugar-free gums can also help to stimulate saliva production and keep your mouth and throat properly hydrated.</p><h2>Long-Term Side Effects of Sertraline (Zoloft)</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline has been used since the 1990s by tens of millions of people, and in that time there have been no established side effects specific to long-term use.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">That’s not to say that long-term side effects of Zoloft won’t ever be found. However, given the three-ish decades that the medication has been under close observation in patients, it gets less likely every year.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">With tens of millions of prescriptions in the United States alone, sertraline is one of the most widely used SSRI medications on the market, so there are bound to be anecdotal issues with the medication, but they haven’t been seen in studies.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Still, if you see long-term effects as you continue taking sertraline, talk to a professional.</p><h2>Serious Side Effects of Sertraline</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">People who use sertraline may not experience any side effects at all, but it’s also possible for sertraline to cause potentially serious adverse effects for some users. These are quite uncommon, but you should be aware of the warning signs of serious issues.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Some of the potential serious side effects of sertraline include:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Fainting and extreme dizziness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Chest pain</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Persistent bleeding</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Frequent thoughts about death</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Allergic reaction</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Needless to say, if you experience any of these side effects, or your side effects are worsening, you should contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible for medical assistance.</p><h2>Fainting and Extreme Dizziness</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">According to the FDA, a small percentage of people who use sertraline may also experience severe dizziness and lightheadedness.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you feel faint, weak or severely dizzy, or feel differences in your heart rate after taking sertraline, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible.</p><figure><img title="Fainting and Extreme Dizziness" src="IMG/BB1oHeRR_fainting_and_extreme_dizziness.jpg" alt="Fainting and Extreme Dizziness"><figcaption><em>Fainting and Extreme Dizziness. Tunatura / iStock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Chest Pain</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">A small number of people who use sertraline have reported severe chest pain after taking the medication. Chest pain can be a symptom of anxiety, so if chest pain was occurring before the sertraline was started, it’s probably the anxiety, not the medication.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">It’s important to point out that this side effect is very rare. Overall, sertraline is a safe and effective drug that’s widely used successfully, including by people with certain heart problems that make other SSRIs unsuitable. But if you experience severe or unusual chest pain after taking sertraline, you should seek medical help as soon as possible.</p><h2>Persistent Bleeding</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline is one of several SSRIs that may increase the risk of bleeding, according to an article published in the journal Pharmacological Research.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">This means that while using sertraline, your body might have difficulty forming a normal blood clot if you cut or puncture your skin. You may experience nosebleeds or unexplained bruising.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Clotting issues from sertraline use can potentially occur as a result of taking sertraline together with other medications, such as blood thinners, so it’s essential that you inform your healthcare provider of any blood thinners before they prescribe sertraline. If you develop nose bleeds, bleeding gums while brushing your teeth, or unexplained bruising, talk to your doctor.</p><h2>Frequent Thoughts About Death</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline and several other widely used antidepressants can increase your risk of experiencing frequent thoughts about death.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The increased risk of these thoughts appears to be present only in young adults or adolescents who take antidepressant medications.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you experience frequent thoughts about death after you start using sertraline, seek medical assistance as soon as possible.</p><h2>Allergic Reaction</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Seek immediate medical advice immediately if you experience an allergic reaction to sertraline.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Warning signs of an allergic reaction include hives, swollen face, sore throat and itching, but it’s important to remember that even if these side effects seem particularly mild, they should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately for your safety.</p><h2>Final Thoughts on Sertraline Side Effects</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If the above list of nightmare scenarios worries you, it’s important to remember that most people who use sertraline either experience no side effects at all or mild side effects that disappear as they become accustomed to the medication.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The vast majority of users are fine, safe and benefiting from this medication.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Still, there are some important takeaways to remember:</p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">YES sertraline is safe and effective and typically only causes mild side effects.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">BUT just because most people don’t experience problems doesn’t mean you won’t have adverse reactions yourself.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">BEFORE you accept a prescription, make sure to tell your doctor about any health issues and other medications. You should not take sertraline if you have glaucoma, a history of heart problems or are breastfeeding.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">BE AWARE that sertraline can potentially have drug interactions with a wide range of other medications, substances or supplements, like alcohol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and even St. John's Wort.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">FYI: The use of sertraline with other SSRIs could lead to an increased risk of a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome, according to the book StatPearls.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">UNLESS you’re experiencing a serious side effect, do not stop taking sertraline without seeking medical advice. Abruptly stopping sertraline before your next dose could lead to uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms, including eye pain, nausea, headaches, irritability, nightmares or frequent thoughts about death. </p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sertraline will hopefully help you regain control over your mental health and day-to-day life and you’ll never see this list of side effects again. But if you’re worried or have further questions, talk to a professional.</p><figure><img title="Final Thoughts on Sertraline Side Effects" src="IMG/AA1o8o7F_final_thoughts_on_sertraline_side_effects.jpg" alt="Final Thoughts on Sertraline Side Effects"><figcaption><em>Final Thoughts on Sertraline Side Effects.
