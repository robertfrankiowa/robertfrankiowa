    <main><h1>15 Collagen-Rich Superfoods to Help Turn Back the Clock on Aging</h1><p>Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal origin, comprising approximately 30% of total protein in an animal. </p><p>As we age, our body’s natural collagen production declines, leading to visible signs of aging like wrinkles, sagging skin and joint pain. </p><p>However, including these 15 collagen-promoting superfoods into your diet will keep you looking and feeling youthful from the inside out.</p><h2>1. Beef Bone Broth</h2><p>Beef bone broth is one of the best dietary sources of collagen. Bone broth is made by simmering bones in water for an extended period of time, which extracts the collagen and other nutrients from the bones. </p><p>Collagen is the main structural protein in bones, and when cooked, it breaks down into gelatin, which is easily absorbed by the body. </p><h2>2. Pork Bone Broth</h2><p>Just like beef bone broth, pork bone broth is made by simmering pork bones in water for a long period of time, which breaks down the collagen and other nutrients into a digestible form. </p><p>Pork bones are rich in collagen, which can help improve joint health, strengthen bones, and improve skin elasticity. </p><figure><img title="2.

Skin-on Chicken</h2><p>Skin-on chicken is a source of collagen. The skin of the chicken contains collagen, which is the main structural protein in connective tissue. </p><p>When cooked, the collagen in the chicken skin breaks down into gelatin, which is more easily absorbed by the body. </p><h2>4. Seafood</h2><p>Seafood, particularly shellfish, is a good source of collagen. Shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, and lobster, have an exoskeleton made of chitin, which is a tough, fibrous substance. When cooked, the chitin breaks down into a compound called chitosan, which is very similar to collagen. </p><p>Other seafood, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel, contain omega-3 fatty acids, which can support joint health by reducing inflammation.</p><figure><img title="4. Seafood" src="IMG/BB1nhVz3_4_seafood.jpg" alt="4. Seafood"><figcaption><em>4. Seafood. Image Credit: Bigc Studio/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5. Organ Meats</h2><p>Organ meats are excellent sources of collagen. The skin, bones, and connective tissue of organ meats like liver, kidneys, and heart contain high amounts of collagen. </p><p>These parts of the animal are typically discarded during processing, but they can be cooked and consumed to provide your body with a concentrated source of collagen. Liver, for example, is particularly rich in vitamin C and iron, which are both necessary for collagen production.</p><h2>6. Gelatin</h2><p>Gelatin is a form of collagen that has been broken down into a form that is easy for the body to absorb. It is made by simmering animal bones, skins, and connective tissue for a long period of time, which breaks down the collagen into gelatin. </p><p>When consumed, the gelatin is absorbed into the bloodstream and is used by the body to support the formation of new collagen. Gelatin is particularly beneficial for joint health and skin elasticity and can be found in gummy vitamins and candies.</p><figure><img title="6. Gelatin" src="IMG/BB1nhQNj_6_gelatin.jpg" alt="6. Gelatin"><figcaption><em>6. Gelatin. Image Credit: Ahanov Michael/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7. Steaks</h2><p>Steaks, especially those with a good amount of marbling, are a source of collagen. The fat and connective tissue found in steak can provide the body with collagen that is easier to absorb and use than in its raw form. </p><p>The type of steak can also affect the amount of collagen it contains. Grass-fed beef tends to have more collagen because the cattle are allowed to graze on pasture.</p><h2>8. Legumes</h2><p>Legumes, such as beans, lentils, and chickpeas, are a good source of nutrients that can support collagen production. Legumes are rich in protein, which contains amino acids that are needed for collagen synthesis. </p><p>They also contain good amounts of iron, zinc, and manganese, which are important cofactors for the enzymes involved in collagen formation. </p><h2>9. Berries</h2><p>Berries contain a variety of nutrients that can support collagen production and maintenance in the body. Berries are rich in vitamin C, which is necessary for collagen synthesis. </p><p>They are also packed with antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, which can protect collagen from free radical damage. </p><h2>10. Tomatoes</h2><p>Tomatoes contain several nutrients that support collagen production and health. Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C, which promotes collagen synthesis. </p><p>They also contain lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that can help protect collagen from oxidative damage. In addition, tomatoes are a good source of vitamin K, which activates the enzymes that are necessary for collagen formation. </p><h2>11. Leafy Greens</h2><p>Leafy greens, like spinach, kale, and collard greens, are rich in nutrients that support collagen production in the body. </p><p>While they do not contain collagen directly, they are packed with nutrients, which are essential for collagen synthesis. Vitamin C, in particular, is required for the formation of procollagen, the precursor to collagen. </p><h2>12. Peppers</h2><p>Peppers contain nutrients that can support collagen health. Peppers are rich in vitamin C, which is vital for collagen production and repair. </p><p>Yellow bell peppers, in particular, are a good source of vitamin C, with over 120 mg of the daily recommended intake in a single cup (ref). Red bell peppers are also a rich source of vitamin A, which can support the formation of new collagen. </p><figure><img title="12. Peppers" src="IMG/BB1ni3cx_12_peppers.jpg" alt="12. Peppers"><figcaption><em>12. Peppers. Image Credit: barmalini/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><h2>13. Citrus Fruits</h2><p>Citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, and grapefruits, are rich in nutrients that promote collagen production in the body. </p><p>The main nutrient is vitamin C, which is required for the conversion of procollagen into mature collagen. The mature collagen is used by the body for tissue repair and regeneration. </p><h2>14. Egg Whites</h2><p>Egg whites contain proteins and amino acids that can support collagen production in the body. </p><p>Specifically, egg whites contain the amino acid proline, which is essential for collagen synthesis. Egg whites simply provide the building blocks for collagen production.</p><h2>15. Collagen-Infused Drinks</h2><p>Collagen drinks are designed to provide the body with a concentrated source of collagen that can be easily absorbed. </p><p>Some popular types of collagen-infused drinks include collagen peptide powder (can be added to smoothies, coffee, tea, or water) and bone broth drinks. </p><p>By nourishing your body with these 15 nutrient-dense foods, you not only promote skin elasticity and joint health but also boost overall well-being. Having a balanced diet packed with collagen-boosting ingredients, coupled with a healthy lifestyle, can be a powerful recipe for maintaining a youthful glow and vitality.</p><ol> <li><em>ifrj.upm.edu pdf</em></li> </ol><p><em>ifrj.upm.edu pdf</em></p></main>
