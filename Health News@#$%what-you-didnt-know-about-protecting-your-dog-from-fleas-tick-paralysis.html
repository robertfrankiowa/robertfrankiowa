    <main><h1>What You Didn’t Know About Protecting Your Dog from Fleas & Tick Paralysis</h1><p>A single tick bite can transmit Lyme disease to your dog within 36 hours. Fleas and ticks are not just annoying; they pose serious health risks to both pets and humans. </p><p>Fleas can cause allergic reactions, transmit tapeworms, and lead to severe skin infections. Ticks are notorious for spreading diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and anaplasmosis. </p><p>With these dangers in mind, taking proactive measures to protect your dog from these persistent parasites year-round​is crucial.</p><h2>Understanding the Threat</h2><p>Fleas can cause severe itching, allergic reactions, and transmit tapeworms. Their bites may lead to flea allergy dermatitis, resulting in intense itching, hair loss, and secondary infections from scratching. Fleas also spread diseases like murine typhus and bartonellosis (cat scratch disease), affecting both pets and humans.</p><p>Ticks are notorious for spreading serious diseases. Lyme disease, caused by <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, results in fever, joint pain, and lethargy in dogs . Other tick-borne diseases include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, each with debilitating symptoms. Ticks can also cause tick paralysis, where toxins in their saliva lead to muscle paralysis, potentially fatal if untreated.</p><p>Both fleas and ticks can cause anemia due to blood loss, especially in severe infestations. Puppies, small dogs, and older dogs are particularly vulnerable. Fleas can lay up to 40 eggs a day, leading to rapid infestations, while ticks often hide in hard-to-spot areas of your dog’s body.</p><p>Preventing infestations is crucial for protecting your pet’s health and your household’s well-being. Fleas and ticks can transfer to humans, posing zoonotic disease risks. Year-round protection is essential, as these pests can thrive indoors and in mild winter conditions.</p><p>Understanding these dangers highlights the need for effective preventative measures to protect your pets from these relentless parasites.</p><h2>1. Topical Treatments</h2><p>Topical treatments are a popular choice for many dog owners. These are applied directly to your dog’s skin, usually between the shoulder blades, and can protect for up to a month. </p><figure><img title="1.

These chewable tablets kill fleas and ticks from the inside out. They usually need to be administered monthly or quarterly, depending on the product.</p><h2>3. Flea & Tick Collars</h2><p> Tick collars provide long-lasting protection, often up to eight months. These collars release active ingredients in low concentrations, protecting your dog’s entire body.</p><figure><img title="3. Flea & Tick Collars" src="IMG/BB1pLrol_3_flea_tick_collars.jpg" alt="3.

Shampoos & Sprays</h2><p>While not as long-lasting as other treatments, flea and tick shampoos and sprays can be useful for immediate relief. These products kill pests on contact and can be used in conjunction with other treatments for added protection.</p><h2>5. Natural Remedies</h2><p>For those looking to avoid chemicals, natural remedies like essential oils (lavender, peppermint) can repel fleas and ticks. However, always consult with your vet before using essential oils, as some can be toxic to dogs.</p><figure><img title="5. Natural Remedies" src="IMG/BB1pLroC_5_natural_remedies.jpg" alt="5.

Regular Cleaning</strong>: Vacuum your home frequently, especially areas where your dog spends time. Wash your dog’s bedding in hot water weekly to kill any fleas or eggs. Consider using a flea spray for your home to treat carpets and furniture.</p><p><strong>2. Yard Care</strong>: Maintain your yard by mowing the lawn regularly and removing tall grasses and brush where ticks thrive. Treat your yard with outdoor flea and tick sprays or granules to create a barrier that keeps these pests away from your home.</p><h2>Routine Checks</h2><p><strong>1. Daily Inspections</strong>: After outdoor activities, check your dog for ticks. Pay special attention to areas like the ears, neck, between the toes, and under the tail. Regular brushing can help you spot and remove these pests before they latch on.</p><p><strong>2. Immediate Removal</strong>: If you find a tick, remove it promptly using fine-tipped tweezers. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull upward with steady pressure. Clean the area with antiseptic afterward to prevent infection.</p><figure><img title="Routine Checks" src="IMG/BB1pLroI_routine_checks.jpg" alt="Routine Checks"><figcaption><em>Routine Checks.

They can recommend the most effective and safe products based on your dog’s age, breed, health status, and lifestyle. Regular veterinary checkups will also ensure early detection and treatment of any tick-borne illnesses.</p><p>Protecting your dog from fleas and ticks requires a multi-faceted approach, combining preventive treatments, regular home and yard maintenance, and routine checks. By staying proactive and informed, you can keep these pesky parasites at bay and ensure your dog enjoys a happy, itch-free life.</p></main>
