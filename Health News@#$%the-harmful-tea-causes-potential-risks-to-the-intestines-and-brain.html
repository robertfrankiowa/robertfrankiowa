    <main><h1>The Harmful Tea Causes Potential Risks to the Intestines and Brain</h1><p>When people think of tea, they often imagine the many health benefits these little leaves in hot water offer the body. However, not all teas are actually good for you. </p><p>Although a wide variety of teas offer relief from indigestion, bloating, fatigue, constipation, and even fighting off the common cold, some tea variations actually damage the intestines as well as the brain.  </p><figure><img title="The Harmful Tea Causes Potential Risks to the Intestines and Brain" src="IMG/BB1pe3Ji_the_harmful_tea_causes_potential_risks_to_the_intestines_and_brain.jpg" alt="The Harmful Tea Causes Potential Risks to the Intestines and Brain"><figcaption><em>The Harmful Tea Causes Potential Risks to the Intestines and Brain.

Therefore, it’s only natural to assume that, once they discovered fire, humans would have heated water to ingest the leaves more easily.  </p><figure><img title="People Have Always Drunk Some Form of Tea" src="IMG/BB1pe3Jl_people_have_always_drunk_some_form_of_tea.jpg" alt="People Have Always Drunk Some Form of Tea"><figcaption><em>People Have Always Drunk Some Form of Tea. @Angel Chen/Linkedin</em></figcaption></figure><h2>The First Record of Tea</h2><p>The earliest evidence of tea drinking on Earth comes from an ancient Chinese manuscript that describes a farmer discovering the delicious drink when he was sitting under a tree with a cup of hot water and loose leaves fell into his mug.  </p><p>That was nearly 2,000 years ago, and since then, tea has become one of the most time-honored traditions in Chinese culture. The Chinese use medicinal teas for ailments and ceremonial teas for special occasions, and they drink regular brews on a daily basis with family and friends.  </p><h2>Tea Has Become One of the Most Popular Beverages All Around the World</h2><p>But of course, tea isn’t only popular in China. In fact, it is one of the most beloved beverages in countries all over the world. In England, a cup of black tea with milk and sugar is the national beverage, and in India, hundreds of millions of people drink chai tea every day.    </p><p>But tea has changed drastically over the past millennium. While some people and cultures still utilize the leaves from local plants, others prefer to drink their tea from conveniently-made bags.    </p><h2>Health Concerns in Tea Bags</h2><p>In 8th-century China, tea was packaged into small paper bags for convenience, but the modern-day tea bag wasn't invented until the early 1900s. </p><p>Unfortunately, over the past century, the bags have transitioned from hand-sewed fabric to food-grade plastic, which can leak microplastics into the tea and then into your body. Additionally, modern tea bags are often made with aluminum and epichlorohydrin, which are known to cause Alzheimer’s and cancer, respectively. </p><h2>Certain Teas Are Also Extremely Dangerous</h2><p>However, even if you avoid all tea bags and use only loose-leaf teas, you still need to be careful, as not all teas are good for you. One kind of tea in particular that doctors know causes intestinal problems is still in every grocery store tea section.   </p><p>Recent studies have shown that teas which are advertised as cleansing, detox, or slimming are often quite dangerous. They can create a dependency, strip the stomach of nutrients, and even cause dehydration.  </p><h2>What Is in a Detox Tea?</h2><p>While different tea brands use various herbs and leaves within their so-called detox or cleansing teas, one of the most common ingredients is senna leaves.  </p><p>The leaves, fruits, and flowers of the senna plant have been utilized in teas for centuries as a natural laxative for constipation. However, overusing the leaves can cause extreme damage to the body, including colon irritation, diarrhea, and vitamin deficiencies.   </p><h2>Why Are Cleansing Teas Bad for the Body?</h2><p>Because senna leaves are natural laxatives and can even suppress appetite, some people use these teas for weight loss. But doctors are urging patients to be extremely careful not to over consume senna leaf tea.  Because it essentially strips the nutrients from the stomach and sends them out through the digestive tract, the body can become dangerously dehydrated, even when someone is drinking plenty of water. </p><h2>Pregnant Women Should Never Drink Senna Leaf Tea</h2><p>It’s important to understand that while cleansing or detox teas made with senna leaves can be helpful for constipation, they should not be overused by anyone, but especially by pregnant women. </p><p>As senna tea often removes necessary vitamins from the body during gestation, it can be extremely detrimental to both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, senna tea should absolutely be avoided at all times during pregnancy.      </p><figure><img title="Pregnant Women Should Never Drink Senna Leaf Tea" src="IMG/BB1pdPY2_pregnant_women_should_never_drink_senna_leaf_tea.jpg" alt="Pregnant Women Should Never Drink Senna Leaf Tea"><figcaption><em>Pregnant Women Should Never Drink Senna Leaf Tea.

It may be shocking, as black tea with lemon is certainly common all around the world, but this specific combination can actually lead to problems in the brain.   </p><p>Because black tea contains a decent amount of aluminum when combined with the citrus juice of lemon, the tea can actually lead to brain damage and, more specifically, the development of Alzheimer’s.    </p><h2>Adding Milk to Black Tea Is a Much Better Option</h2><p>For those who simply love black tea with lemon, there is an option: You can add milk to the tea as the dairy combats the chemical reaction between the aluminum and the lemon.   </p><p>That said, it’s still best to limit your intake of black tea with lemon, even if you add milk every time.    </p><figure><img title="Adding Milk to Black Tea Is a Much Better Option" src="IMG/BB1pdYDv_adding_milk_to_black_tea_is_a_much_better_option.jpg" alt="Adding Milk to Black Tea Is a Much Better Option"><figcaption><em>Adding Milk to Black Tea Is a Much Better Option. Freepik</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Learn What’s in Your Tea</h2><p>These are just two examples of the potential risks of teas; there are actually quite a few more types of teas that can result in physical discomfort, illness, or even more severe conditions. Therefore, it’s incredibly important you know what’s in your tea, what it can do to your body, and which variations are safe to consume, depending on your body and condition.   </p><p>One of the best ways to keep your body safe while enjoying tea is to skip the brand-name tea bags and buy loose leaves. That way, you’ll know exactly what’s in them and keep your body free of pesky microplastics.  </p></main>
