    <main><h1>Depression affects 1 in 5 people. Here's what it feels like.</h1><p>Few mental health conditions are as misunderstood or as mischaracterized as depression. Among mental health professionals, it's known to be a debilitating disorder that can rob people of motivation, happiness and even hope. But among others, the word "depressed" is often tossed about casually or is used synonymously with having a bad day, feeling bummed out or experiencing temporary moments of sadness or melancholy. </p><p>Such feelings can, of course, be symptoms of depression; but occasionally experiencing such feelings when connected to a disappointing turn of events and being diagnosed with clinical depression are two very different things. "The impact of depression on a person's emotional and physical well-being is enormous," says Norman Rosenthal, MD, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What does depression feel like? </h2><p><strong><em>Start the day smarter.

Some people with depression experience reduced feelings of pleasure or a loss of interest in hobbies or activities they used to be passionate about. "The patients I work with sometimes describe feeling empty, numb, or hollow," says Natalie Christine Dattilo, PhD, a clinical & health psychologist and founder of Priority Wellness based in Boston, Massachusetts. "Feelings of deep sadness or despair can come in waves - sometimes unexpectedly - and envelope them," she adds. </p><p><strong>What is languishing?

"Depression is a leading cause of suicide," he says. </p><p>"Many of my therapy clients describe depression as a 'fog' or 'heaviness' that lingers over them and makes it difficult for them to experience happiness or contentment," echoes Jameca Woody Cooper, PhD, a psychologist and adjunct professor at Webster University in Missouri.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">How common is depression?</h2><p>Such symptoms are even more worrisome when you consider how common they are. "Almost 30% of people are estimated to have been diagnosed with depression at some time in their lifetime," says Rosenthal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the current number of U.S. adults suffering from depression to be at being nearly 1 in 5 - with women being more impacted than men by a difference of 24% to 13.3%.</p><p>And depression rates don't seem to be slowing. Already, the World Health Organization recognizes anxiety and depressive disorders as the two most common mental health challenges, and the organization has "projected that depression will rank first by 2030," says John Krystal, MD, a professor of psychiatry, neuroscience and psychology at Yale Department of Psychiatry.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">How to treat depression</h2><p>Despite its debilitating nature and prevalence, there is hope for people suffering from depression. "There are many effective treatments for depression, and they often work best in combination with one another," says Rosenthal. Some natural remedies include adjusting one's diet, spending more time outside, journaling, socializing and exercise. Each of these and several other practices have been shown to alleviate at least some symptoms of depression. </p><p>"Talk to your doctor if you think you might be experiencing symptoms of depression," advises Datillo. "They can evaluate you further and make a recommendation for care."</p><p><em>If you or someone you know needs support for mental health, suicidal thoughts or substance abuse call, text or chat:</em></p><p><em>988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: 988 and 988lifeline.org</em></p><p><em>BlackLine: 800-604-5841 and callblackline.com</em></p><p><em>Trans Lifeline: 877-565-8860 and translifeline.org</em></p><p><em>Veterans Crisis Line: Dial 988 and press 1 to talk to someone; send a text message to 988</em>; <em>or chat 988lifeline.org</em></p></main>
