    <main><h1>20 ways to make your sleep better</h1><p>Sleep is an essential part of life, but too many people struggle with getting enough hours of shut-eye every night. There are so many factors that contribute to poor sleep and conditions like insomnia, and it can be challenging to figure out exactly what's preventing you from getting the rest you need.</p><p>Flip through the slideshow for 20 ways to make your sleep better, from switching up your PJs to investing in a white noise machine and more. </p><h2>Invest in a sleep mask</h2><p>Even if your bedroom is dark, light can peek in through windows and under doors, disrupting your sleep. Invest in a sleep mask that covers your eyes well and is comfortable to wear. For an extra boost of relaxation, try a weighted mask or one infused with a calming scent like lavender. </p><h2>Turn down the temperature</h2><p>The ideal sleeping environment is a little bit cooler than you might normally like, and turning down the thermostat just a few degrees is a good way to make your bedroom more comfortable and conducive to sleep. If you really don't want to turn the A/C down, buy a fan that will both circulate air around the room and provides some white noise. </p><h2>Consider blackout curtains</h2><p>A dark room is also important for good sleep, and if you're frequently being woken up by lights in or outside of your home, blackout curtains can make a world of difference. They're inexpensive and come in tons of colors so you don't have to worry that they won't match your decor. </p><h2>Use earplugs to block out annoying sounds</h2><p>It might take a little getting used to, but light sleepers can benefit tremendously from sleeping with earplugs that can block out the noise of a snoring partner or a raging party at the house next door. Try a few different types to figure out which ones fit your ears best, and keep a pair on your nightstand for a silent night's sleep. </p><figure><img title="Use earplugs to block out annoying sounds" src="IMG/BB1hjyrg_use_earplugs_to_block_out_annoying_sounds.jpg" alt="Use earplugs to block out annoying sounds"><figcaption><em>Use earplugs to block out annoying sounds.

Whether you choose classic white noise, relaxing spa sounds, or the calming sounds of a summer rainstorm, adding a little sound may help you sleep better. </p><h2>Stop using your phone an hour before bed</h2><p>Pretty much everyone is glued to their phones 24/7 these days, and that can have a serious impact on your sleep. Buy an old-fashioned alarm clock and leave your phone to charge in another room, and don't be surprised if your sleep improves. As an added bonus, you'll also have a calmer morning that doesn't start with immediately checking your social media feeds. </p><h2>Consider exercising in the evenings</h2><p>Getting in a little physical activity in the evenings, whether that's simply taking a walk or doing a hardcore workout at the gym, can help make sure you're nice and tired when it's time to go to bed. </p><h2>Think about kicking your pets out of bed</h2><p>As much as we love our furry friends, there's scientific proof that pets can have a negative impact on sleep. Consider kicking your pet out of the bedroom altogether, or if that's not an option, invest in a small pet bed that you can place near the bed so that Fido isn't waking you up in the middle of the night. </p><h2>Get rid of your TV</h2><p>As fun as it is to lounge in bed on the weekends and watch TV, that screen might be impacting your sleep. If you find yourself struggling to sleep after binge-watching your favorite shows, it might be time to limit your TV watching to the living room only. </p><figure><img title="Get rid of your TV" src="IMG/BB1hjp2J_get_rid_of_your_tv.jpg" alt="Get rid of your TV"><figcaption><em>Get rid of your TV.

Consider a meditation app like Calm or Headspace, or check out sleep-inducing meditations on YouTube for a little help getting a good night's sleep. </p><h2>Set a bedtime for yourself</h2><p>It's one of the privileges of being a grown-up, but staying up too late can have a major impact on your sleep hygiene. Set a reasonable bedtime, and make a plan to stick to it every day, even on the weekends. </p><h2>...and stick to a nighttime routine</h2><p>Once you've established a bedtime, you can figure out the best way to wind down. Some folks like to sit back and read for an hour, while others spend time with family and do skincare before hitting the sack. Figure out a relaxing way to wind down, and stick to it. </p><figure><img title="...and stick to a nighttime routine" src="IMG/AA1miNy3_and_stick_to_a_nighttime_routine.jpg" alt="...and stick to a nighttime routine"><figcaption><em>...and stick to a nighttime routine.

If you sleep hot, stick to cotton pajamas that are loose and breathable, and if you find yourself cold in the evening, add an extra layer of insulation with flannel pajamas or long johns. </p><figure><img title="Find the right pajamas" src="IMG/BB1iQR9Z_find_the_right_pajamas.jpg" alt="Find the right pajamas"><figcaption><em>Find the right pajamas.

The right pillow should support your neck and cradle your head. If you find yourself frequently waking up with neck pain, consider a cervical pillow that can help stabilize your neck and offer a better night's sleep. </p><h2>Create the right pre-bedtime ambiance</h2><p>A couple of hours before bedtime, start turning your home into a space that's more hospitable for sleep. If you've got dimmable lights, turn them down to a mellow level, and consider playing relaxing music in the background to help your body get into the mood for sleep. </p><h2>Try a sleep supplement</h2><p>Sleep supplements like melatonin have been used for decades to help people get better rest, and they could be beneficial if you're struggling with sleep. CBD is also becoming a popular sleep aid but talk to your doctor before adding in any new supplements just to make sure they're a good fit for you. </p><h2>Cut out caffeine</h2><p>Coffee is delicious, yes, but consuming it too late might be impacting your ability to get a good night's sleep. Many experts recommend stopping caffeine consumption by noon or 2 p.m. so that the energizing chemical isn't still in your system when it's time for bed. </p><h2>Don't eat before bed</h2><p>Everyone loves a midnight snack, but eating too late can mean that digesting your dinner could keep you from getting a restful night's sleep. Try to stop eating an hour or two before bedtime (unless medically necessary) and see if that helps with any mid-sleep restlessness. </p><h2>Consider replacing your mattress</h2><p>If all else fails, the thing that standing in between you and a good night's sleep might be your mattress. Over time, mattresses can shift and sag, creating pressure points on the body that make for restless sleep and muscle tension. If it's been more than about eight years, it's probably time to consider replacing your mattress. </p></main>
