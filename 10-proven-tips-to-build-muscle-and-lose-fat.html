    <main><h1>10 Proven Tips to Build Muscle and Lose Fat</h1><p>As a personal trainer and certified nutritionist, I have helped hundreds of individuals improve their quality of life through functional nutrition. From weight loss, building muscle, improving gut health and reducing stress/anxiety, I have seen the power that just a few nutritional changes can make on an individual's life.</p><p>"Functional nutrition" is about eating a diet that supplies your body with the best raw materials, aka nutrients, to work with to function at its best. It prioritizes eating a diet full of nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods combined with healthy lifestyle habits to promote overall health and wellness.</p><p>Functional nutrition targets the root cause of underlying health issues instead of just the symptoms. Food intolerances, vitamin deficiencies, gut dysbiosis, blood sugar imbalance, and hormone imbalance are common areas that functional nutrition targets and supports through diet and lifestyle habits.</p><p>With all that in mind, here are ten strategies to help transform your body.</p><h2>1 Probiotics Can Improve Digestion</h2><p><strong>Strategy: </strong>Eat 1 serving of a probiotic-rich food daily to support a balanced gut microbiota. Kefir, plain yogurt, fermented kimchi, sauerkraut, miso and kombucha are some great options.<strong>Changes: </strong>Probiotics can improve digestion and allow the body to absorb nutrients better. Absorption is a key part of feeling good and noticeable changes can include increased energy levels, reduced bloating and gas, regular bowel movements and glowing skin.</p><figure><img title="1 Probiotics Can Improve Digestion" src="IMG/BB1mmGuC_1_probiotics_can_improve_digestion.jpg" alt="1 Probiotics Can Improve Digestion"><figcaption><em>1 Probiotics Can Improve Digestion. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Pairing Carbs With Proteins and/or Fats Leads to Steadier Energy Levels</h2><p><strong>Strategy: </strong>Avoid eating any carbohydrate "naked" and pair it with a protein, a fat or both. For example, instead of eating an apple, add an ounce of walnuts,  a few turkey slices or some cottage cheese alongside it.<strong>Changes: </strong>The act of pairing a carbohydrate with either a fat or a protein source will result in steadier energy levels throughout the day which has a huge impact on performance and quality of life. Including protein or fat with carbohydrates can also enhance satiety and help control appetite, which helps any weight loss or weight management goal.</p><h2>3 High Protein Meals Stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis</h2><p>Strategy: Eat at least 30g of quality protein at every meal, about 3-4 hours apart. Quality protein sources include chicken, beef, fish, shellfish, egg, greek yogurt, protein powder, and cottage cheese. Use your palm as a rough measure for one serving of meat or fish. Eat 1-2 servings per meal.⁠</p><p>Changes: Eating 30g of protein throughout the day will stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS), the process by which the body builds and repairs muscle tissue. This combined with resistance training will lead to an increase in lean muscle mass, faster recovery from exercise and enhanced performance.</p><h2>4 Eat This Minimum of Fiber to Feel Fuller, Longer</h2><p><strong>Strategy: </strong>Eat a minimum of 25g fiber per day from soluble and insoluble sources like chia seeds, avocado, ground flaxseed, artichokes, berries and beans.<strong>Changes: </strong>Fiber adds bulk to the stool which improves bowel regularity and reduces constipation, which are important for a healthy digestive system. Fiber also helps slow the absorption of sugar while increasing satiety and fullness, which ultimately help weight management. A higher fiber intake is an important part of a healthy diet, especially if weight loss is the goal.</p><h2>5 Practice Mindful Eating to Prevent Bloating</h2><p><strong>Strategy: </strong>Practice mindful eating by taking at least 20 minutes to eat an entire meal and chewing every bit of food until liquid (about 30 times) before swallowing. Chewing food thoroughly is the first step of the digestive process, and as we chew,  an enzyme called amylase is secreted to help break down carbohydrates.<strong>Changes: </strong>Following this chewing method can help reduce acid reflux and bloating after eating. The mechanical breakdown of food during chewing helps to mix it with saliva, promoting better digestion which can reduce bloating, indigestion, GERD and even overeating.</p><h2>6 Drink Half Your Body Weight in Ounces of Water For Healthier Skin</h2><p><strong>Strategy: </strong>Drink half your body weight in ounces of water. For example, if you are 150 pounds, aim for 75 ounces per pay. If you exercise, add an additional 20 ounces of water. Pro tip: Start the day with 15-20 ounces of water before any food or coffee in the morning to jump start your intake for the day.<strong>Changes:</strong> It only takes a  2% drop in body water to cause dehydration symptoms like headaches, irritability, fatigue, cramps, joint pain, constipation and heartburn. Staying adequately hydrated can lead to various positive physical changes from increased energy levels, better cognitive function to healthier skin and hair.</p><figure><img title="6 Drink Half Your Body Weight in Ounces of Water For Healthier Skin" src="IMG/BB1lEhhs_6_drink_half_your_body_weight_in_ounces_of_water_for_healthier_skin.jpg" alt="6 Drink Half Your Body Weight in Ounces of Water For Healthier Skin"><figcaption><em>6 Drink Half Your Body Weight in Ounces of Water For Healthier Skin. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="title">Reduce Processed Foods For Better Health</h2><strong>Strategy:</strong><strong>Changes: </strong><figure><img title="7 Increase Food Sources of Omega-3s for Anti-Inflammatory Properties" src="IMG/AA1nvNhi_7_increase_food_sources_of_omega_3s_for_anti_inflammatory_properties.jpg" alt="7 Increase Food Sources of Omega-3s for Anti-Inflammatory Properties"><figcaption><em>7 Increase Food Sources of Omega-3s for Anti-Inflammatory Properties. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Increasing Antioxidants Will Improve Immune Function</h2><p><strong>Strategy: </strong>Eat a variety of vegetables and fruits every day, aiming for 3 1-cup servings minimum. To help with variety, think about colors of the rainbow and try to get a mix of all colors on your plate. For example, iIf you notice a lot of your choices are the color green, look for some red or yellow to add in.<strong>Changes: </strong>Eating a variety of vegetables and fruits is beneficial because they are rich in essential nutrients, fiber, antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and potentially lowering the risk of chronic disease. Eating more vegetables and fruits has an impact on immune function as well so an individual may experience less illness and better overall health with more diversity in their diet.</p><figure><img title="9 Increasing Antioxidants Will Improve Immune Function" src="IMG/AA1neHWj_9_increasing_antioxidants_will_improve_immune_function.jpg" alt="9 Increasing Antioxidants Will Improve Immune Function"><figcaption><em>9 Increasing Antioxidants Will Improve Immune Function. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure></main>
