    <main><h1>Why You Gain Weight Even When You Eat Less</h1><p>With the proliferation of convenience stores and 24-hour food delivery services, accessibility to food has increased, leading to frequent late-night snacking. However, developing such a habit can pose health problems. If you often indulge in late-night snacks, it’s worth considering whether you might be experiencing “Late-Night Eating Syndrome.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Late-Night Eating Syndrome?</strong></h2><p>Late-Night Eating Syndrome is when more than 50% of your daily food intake occurs after 7 PM, often accompanied by symptoms such as insomnia and other sleep disturbances. Consuming snacks late at night can increase the risk of chronic illnesses like sleep disorders, digestive problems, obesity, stress, high blood pressure, and diabetes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Late-Night Eating Syndrome Is Risky:</strong></h2><p>People with Late-Night Eating Syndrome tend to skip or consume minimal breakfast and lunch, resulting in a 5-10% lower basal metabolic rate than the average person. Typically, late-night snacks consist of high-fat, high-sugar, and high-sodium foods, leading to excessive fat storage and reduced intake of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and protein.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Gangnamtimes" src="IMG/AA1h9bD4_why_you_gain_weight_even_when_you_eat_less.jpg" alt="Why You Gain Weight Even When You Eat Less"><figcaption><em>.

Spicy or salty foods can irritate the stomach lining, potentially causing gastritis and, in severe cases, even peptic ulcers, especially when combined with poor sleep quality or high-stress levels.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Contributor to Obesity and Insomnia:</strong></h2><p>Late-night snacking is a well-known contributor to both obesity and insomnia. When you eat before bedtime, your brain cells remain active during digestion, leading to reduced melatonin secretion, a hormone responsible for sleep regulation. Studies have shown a higher prevalence of Late-Night Eating Syndrome among obese individuals, with the likelihood increasing alongside obesity levels. A high-calorie diet during late-night hours can lead to abdominal obesity and other health issues, including elevated blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and triglycerides.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cereal and Milk: A Good Option?</strong></h2><p>Foods like cereal and milk, typically associated with breakfast, can also serve as suitable late-night snacks. However, opting for low-sugar cereal and fat-free or low-fat milk is essential. Milk contains the amino acid “tryptophan,” which induces serotonin secretion, aiding sleep. High-fat dairy, however, delays digestion and can disrupt sleep, making skim or low-fat milk a better choice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healthy Late-night Snacks</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking for healthier late-night snack options, consider foods that provide satiety without excessive calories. Almonds, for instance, contain magnesium, which helps relax muscles, and is also rich in calcium. Bananas, known for muscle relaxation and serotonin production, can also be a good choice. These options can help you satisfy late-night cravings without the drawbacks of high-fat, high-sugar snacks.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Self-Assessment for Late-Night Eating Syndrome:</strong></h2><p>Consider the following self-assessment items to determine if you might be at risk of Late-Night Eating Syndrome. If you have five or more of these symptoms, you may be at risk:</p><ol> <li>Frequently eating late-night snacks before bedtime.</li>    <li>Often waking up during the night feeling hungry.</li>    <li>Difficulty falling asleep before 1 AM.</li>    <li>Irregular sleep patterns.</li>    <li>A preference for fast food.</li>    <li>Skipping breakfast and lacking the appetite for lunch.</li>    <li>Overeating late at night and experiencing guilt.</li>    <li>Overindulging during times of stress.</li>    <li>Significant weight fluctuations and abdominal obesity.</li>    <li>Daily smoking and regular alcohol consumption.</li> </ol><figure><img title="Provided by Gangnamtimes" src="IMG/AA1h99Qr_why_you_gain_weight_even_when_you_eat_less.jpg" alt="Why You Gain Weight Even When You Eat Less"><figcaption><em>.

If you feel hungry at night despite having had enough nutrition during the day, it may be a ‘false hunger.’ If you’re not accustomed to eating breakfast, it’s necessary to make an effort to establish the habit, even if it’s just a glass of milk or half an apple.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Gangnamtimes" src="IMG/AA1h99Qv_why_you_gain_weight_even_when_you_eat_less.jpg" alt="Why You Gain Weight Even When You Eat Less"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Gangnamtimes</em></figcaption></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Manage stress</strong></h2><p>Late-night snacking syndrome induces and promotes false cravings, mainly due to the influence of ‘stress hormones.’ If you cultivate a habit of relieving stress through means other than food regularly, your desire for late-night snacks may naturally decrease. Take a moment to reflect on how you currently cope with stress and consider changing your approach if you use food to manage. Ideally, try to minimize stress in your life in the first place.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don’t Let Emotions Dictate You</strong></h2><p>Emotional eating is eating to soothe one’s emotions, even when not hungry. When you’ve already had dinner but still feel the urge to snack, it’s crucial to distinguish whether you genuinely feel hungry or your emotions drive you to eat. Recognizing your state of mind is the first step in changing this habit.</p></main>
