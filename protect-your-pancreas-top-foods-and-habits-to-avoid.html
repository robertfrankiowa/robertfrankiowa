Its proper functioning plays a fundamental role in our body, so taking care of it daily is essential, mainly through a proper diet. What products are worth eliminating from your diet or limiting their consumption?</p></strong><h2>Food high in sugar</h2><p>Doctors and dietitians have long warned against the consumption of sugar, which is a breeding ground for cancer and increases the risk of developing many other serious diseases. Regular consumption of sweet snacks can negatively affect the functioning of the liver, intestines, and pancreas and contribute to the development of diabetes.</p><p>Importantly, sugar is practically everywhere. It's worth remembering that sugar, popularly called "white death," is found in candies and carbonated drinks, fruit juices, powdered soups, ready meals, ketchup, and breakfast cereals. Sugar can come in various forms, such as high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, which can also harm health.</p><p>Yogurts are exceptionally high in sugar. Research conducted by scientists at the University of Leeds found that out of nearly 900 yogurts available in supermarkets, the most sugar was found in yogurt-based desserts. The worst performers were fruit yogurts, containing about 12 grams of sugar per 3.5 ounces of product, comparable to cola's sugar content! It is worth looking for "light" versions of yogurt with reduced sugar content on store shelves.</p><h2>Fried and fatty foods</h2><p>Fried foods, which are rich in fat, are among the most harmful food products. Such dishes raise the level of bad LDL cholesterol in the blood and burden the liver and pancreas. It is better to choose cooking techniques such as baking or steaming. Importantly, they often do not require special culinary skills.</p><h2>Meat</h2><p>Red meat also has a destructive impact on the pancreas. Consuming it in excessive amounts is harmful to our health. Avoiding it in favor of lean white meat, fatty seafood, and legumes is recommended. People with pancreatic problems should avoid processed meat products such as canned meats, pates, sausages, or certain cold cuts, which contain flavor enhancers, preservatives, and carcinogenic compounds.</p><h2>Alcohol</h2><p>Alcohol is another enemy of our pancreas. Alcoholic beverages also affect other organs. They not only destroy the liver but also harm patients with diabetes and can lead to pancreatitis. Moreover, alcohol consumption increases the risk of developing cancer and gastritis and affects the nervous system.</p><p>A good idea would be to give up alcohol entirely. A fascinating alternative could be replacing this habit with increasingly popular 0% alcohol products—primarily non-alcoholic beers.</p><h2>Cigarettes</h2><p>Everyone knows that inhaling tobacco smoke promotes the development of lung cancer, but few realize that smoking cigarettes can also lead to stomach problems and chronic or acute pancreatitis. Quitting smoking promptly will undoubtedly have a positive impact on our health.</p><p><b>Read also:</b></p><p>Steps to lower your cancer risk: Expert tips and lifestyle changes</p><p>Protect your pancreas: the essential diet adjustments to fend off inflammation</p><p>Foods to avoid for a healthier heart: Experts reveal top offenders</p></main>
