About 4.74 million people are affected in Germany alone, according to data from the current AOK Health Atlas. The numbers were made available to FOCUS online.</p><h2>               <strong>What is coronary heart disease and why is it so dangerous?</strong>             </h2><p>In coronary heart disease (CHD), the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with oxygen-rich blood, are calcified, explains the German Heart Foundation. If narrowing or obstructions occur due to this calcification, the blood flow to the heart is correspondingly hindered.</p><p>Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) have an increased risk of heart rhythm disorders, heart attacks or heart failure, which also increases mortality.</p><h2>               <strong>Which districts are particularly affected?</strong>             </h2><p>The Health Atlas records very high disease rates especially in the eastern part of Germany.</p><p>Saxony-Anhalt is at the top, where the proportion of CHD patients in the population was 12.2 percent, followed by Thuringia with 10.5 percent. For comparison: in Hamburg, the state with the lowest disease rate, the proportion of affected people was only half as high as in Saxony-Anhalt at 6.0 percent.</p><p>A look at the 400 districts and independent cities in Germany shows that the fewest patients with coronary heart disease live in Frankfurt am Main with 5.3 percent and Freising with 5.4 percent. The two most affected districts are in Saxony-Anhalt: the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld with 15.0 percent and the Salzlandkreis with 14.3 percent.</p><p>"Compared to 2017, however, the large range between high prevalence in the east and a lower prevalence in the western federal states has slightly decreased," says Helmut Schröder, managing director of the Scientific Institute of the AOK (WIdO).</p><h2>               <strong>What is the reason for this?</strong>             </h2><p>Overall, however, a positive trend is emerging. According to the Health Atlas, in the year</p><ul>               <li>2022 about 4.74 million people were affected by coronary heart disease (8.1 percent of the population over 30 years),</li>               <li>2017 there were still 4.85 million sick people (8.8 percent).</li>             </ul><p>This means that the number of patients with CHD has decreased by about 108,000 people in the last five years.</p><p>"The positive trend is likely to be related to lifestyle changes such as the increasing reductions in smoking and improved medical treatment of the risk factors for coronary heart disease," says Schröder.</p><p>"However, there is no reason to give the all-clear, because at the same time we are seeing negative developments in diseases that are considered important risk factors for the development of coronary heart disease." This includes in particular type 2 diabetes (10.9 percent in 2017 to 11.1 percent in 2022) and hypertension (29.5 percent in 2017 to 30.0 percent in 2022).</p><p>The Health Atlas shows that in regions where there is a high proportion of diabetes, more patients with coronary heart disease also live in the adjusted comparison (factors such as age have been calculated out).</p><h2>               <strong>What are the risk factors and how can I protect myself?</strong>             </h2><p>Some risk factors for CHD are not influenceable. These include age and genetic predispositions. But there are also influenceable risk factors. The German Heart Foundation mentions the following six most important heart protection factors:</p><ul>               <li>                 <strong>Avoid smoking:</strong>                  Smoking is proven to harm the heart, the blood vessels, and other organs. Therefore, refrain from all types of tobacco products.               </li>               <li>                 <strong>Watch your blood pressure:</strong>                  High blood pressure increases the risk of developing CHD. The dangerous thing about this is that in the beginning, high blood pressure does not cause any discomfort.               </li>               <li>                 <strong>Keep an eye on cholesterol:</strong>                  Cholesterol is also a known risk factor for CHD. In addition to the good (HDL) cholesterol, there is harmful cholesterol (LDL cholesterol).               </li>               <li>                 <strong>Prevent diabetes mellitus:</strong>                  Diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease.               </li>               <li>                 <strong>Get some exercise:</strong>                  Lack of exercise leads to obesity and thus to high blood pressure, diabetes, and increased cholesterol.               </li>               <li>                 <strong>Avoid being overweight:</strong>                  Obesity is one of the most dangerous risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Ask your doctor about the Body Mass Index as well.               </li>             </ul><h2>               <strong>How is coronary heart disease treated?</strong>             </h2><p>In the treatment of CHD, medications are usually prescribed first. These do not eliminate the narrowing of the coronary arteries, but often enable patients to live a good and long life.</p><p>In addition, doctors have two other treatment options to open up the blood vessels: they can insert stents with a heart catheter or bypass narrow spots with additional blood vessels. Always talk to a specialist about possible forms of treatment and never stop taking medication by yourself without speaking to your doctor first.</p></main>
