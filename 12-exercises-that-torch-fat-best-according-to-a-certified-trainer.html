    <main><h1>12 Exercises That Torch Fat Best, According to a Certified Trainer</h1><p>As a nationally board-certified and licensed athletic trainer with ten years of experience in the fitness industry, I have trained middle school, high school, college, and professional athletes in just about every sport, along with moms, dads, grandmas, and grandpas up to the age of 94. I have encountered just about every demographic and scenario you can imagine. What holds true is that every client wants to feel stronger, and look more lean.</p><p>So here are my 5 favorite fat burning exercises—yes they are boring, but we have to remember that simplicity is a major key to consistency and one workout will never make or break your fat-burning goals.</p><h2>1 Squats</h2><p>Goblet, Back, Front, etc…. Squats are the most commonly done exercise in the world, we all squat subconsciously in day-to-day activities and squatting uses your entire lower body and hip complex, all of your abdominal muscles, erector spinae, and much more. There are tons and tons of variations and all of which have huge benefits when performed correctly and when structured properly into a workout.</p><figure><img title="1 Squats" src="IMG/BB1o9qO2_1_squats.jpg" alt="1 Squats"><figcaption><em>1 Squats. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Deadlifts</h2><p>Trap bar, Kettlebell, Barbell, Dumbbell, etc… Deadlifts are often deemed a dangerous exercise, and I don't agree entirely. The bottom line is the target: your entire posterior chain of lower body muscles, your lower back, erector spinae, all abdominal muscles, traps, lats, and biceps. I think these should be done for sets of 6-12 reps with 2-3 minutes of rest in between.</p><h2>3 Sprinting</h2><p>Repeat sprints to be exact. Doing repeat sprints emulates HIIT training and many forms of sport. When most people get asked what they would prefer their body to look like, 100m sprinter or marathon runner, they choose sprinter every time. Get and keep your heart rate elevated with max effort full body running intervals.</p><h2>4 Step Ups/Stairs/Hills</h2><p>Overcoming vertical distance. When I was playing football my senior year in high school and I was trying to get in shape for basketball season, I would run extra hills at practice with my pads on and stairs after practice with no pads. The idea of this movement group is that you are changing levels and alternating legs to generate force and this activates all of your leg muscles, and elevates your heart rate significantly.</p><figure><img title="4 Step Ups/Stairs/Hills" src="IMG/AA1o5nSp_4_step_upsstairshills.jpg" alt="4 Step Ups/Stairs/Hills"><figcaption><em>4 Step Ups/Stairs/Hills. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Kettlebell Swings</h2><p>Single Arm, Double, Russian, American, etc… These can be so effective when done correctly, I was worried about adding them because they can be complex and increase risk of injury but they are fantastic for using your entire body and elevating your heart rate. Another thing that people aren't aware of is that every time you change your body position relative to gravitational force your body regulates blood pressure. That is why a lot of the exercises mentioned below, as add-ons, incorporate the idea of moving between parallel and perpendicular to the ground.</p><h2>6 These Very Effective Fat-Torching Exercises</h2><strong>1.

The key ingredients for achieving that include prioritizing protein intake, hydration, adequate rest, and engaging in compound resistance training. Understanding that spot reduction is a myth, emphasis should be placed on systemic fat loss through compound exercise movements like squats, deadlifts, sprints, step-ups, and kettlebell swings. By incorporating these exercises with intention and consistency, you can torch fat and transform into a leaner and stronger version of yourself.
