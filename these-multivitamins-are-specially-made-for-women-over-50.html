    <main><h1>These Multivitamins Are Specially Made for Women Over 50</h1><h2>Women’s 50+ Multivitamins</h2><p>The One A Day Women’s 50+ Multivitamins are designed to be a quick and easy way to cover your nutritional bases. These vitamins feature nutrients to support your bone health, heart health, eye health, and immune health. The vitamin includes calcium, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E. It's also taken once a day and is free of things you may not want in your vitamins, like gluten, wheat, soy, and dairy. </p><h2>Minis Women 50+</h2><p>Large pills can be tough to swallow. If taking horse pills daily isn’t your thing, Centrum Minis are a good option. These multivitamins are 50% smaller than the standard size, making them easy to swallow. They’re also free of gluten, artificial flavors, and sweeteners. Reviewers swear that they’re easy to swallow, and don’t leave a bad taste in your mouth.</p><figure><img title="Minis Women 50+" src="IMG/AA1dblHR_minis_women_50.jpg" alt="Minis Women 50+"><figcaption><em>Minis Women 50+. Centrum</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Multivitamin For Her 50+</h2><p>Gans suggests these pills from Nature Made. They contain 22 key nutrients, including vitamins to support bone health, immune health, and energy metabolism. “The dose is one pill per day, and it is third-party certified,” says Gans. While these are softgels, the same vitamin comes in tablet form if you prefer something you can chew.</p><h2>Alive! Women’s 50+ Gummy Multivitamin</h2><p>Dietitians generally don’t recommend taking gummy vitamins, given that they can be a sneaky source of added sugar and calories. But if swallowing large pills just isn’t for you, it’s worth considering. These multivitamins go down easy and have a yummy berry flavor to make the process of taking your vitamins enjoyable. They feature eight different B vitamins to help support your brain and cellular health. The Alive! Women’s 50+ Gummy Multivitamin is vegetarian, and free of potential allergens like dairy, wheat, peanut, and egg.</p><figure><img title="Alive!

This pick contains important micronutrients like calcium, zinc, beta-carotene, and vitamins B, D3, C, and E, all designed to support your heart, brain, eye, and bone health. The vitamins are also non-GMO and gluten-free.</p><h2>Personalized Vitamins</h2><p>Everyone has different nutritional needs. With that, it makes sense to take a multivitamin that’s tailor-made for you. Persona’s personalized vitamins are created after you answer a few questions about your health and personal needs. From there, they’ll ship your speciality vitamins to your door. A nice perk: Each serving is individually wrapped, making these easy to take on the go.</p><h2>Women’s Masters 50+ Multivitamin</h2><p>This SmartyPants gummy multivitamin is packed with 17 essential nutrients, including omega-3 EPA/DHA from fish oil, lutein/zeaxanth for eye health, CoQ10 for heart health, vitamin D3 for immunity, and vitamin B12 for energy. It’s also third-party tested and comes in a berry flavor reviewers rave about. Worth noting upfront: You need to take four of these a day.</p><h2>Mykind Organics Women 55+</h2><p>Specifically formulated for the needs of women over 55 years old, this multivitamin is not only third-party tested, but it’s also vegan, certified USDA organic, and non-GMO.

It’s also free of gluten, dairy, and soy, and contains lutein for eye health. Just a heads up: You’ll need to take three capsules a day. </p><h2>Multivitamins for women over 50: Benefits</h2><p>Generally, taking a multivitamin can supplement one’s diet and help fill in nutritional gaps, says Gans. As you age, however, there are more health issues that you might deal with. </p><p>So, a multivitamin specifically formulated for women over 50 can help ensure you’re getting the vitamins and minerals that your body requires, says Dr. Bachmann. Vitamins for women over 50 contain nutrients that women in this age group are at higher risk of deficiency in or may have increased needs for. </p><p>For instance, because women in this age group are at greater risk of osteoporosis, it may be a good idea to supplement with more vitamin D and calcium, which help support bone health.However, there is one nutrient of which your body might generally need less as you age and reach post-menopause: iron. </p><p>When you don’t have a monthly period, you don’t need to replace lost blood cells, Dr. Bachmann explains. Still, it’s important to consider your individual needs. If you’re anemic, you may want to consider a supplement that contains iron.</p><p>As always, talk with your doctor for individualized recommendations.</p><h2>How to choose the best multivitamin for women over 50</h2><p>When you’re 50 and up, experts say there are a few nutrients you should be looking for in a multivitamin:</p><ul><li><strong>B12</strong>. This is important if you don’t eat a lot of meat, says Kathryn Boling, M.D., a primary care physician at Baltimore’s Mercy Medical Center. Vitamin B12 is good for your brain and “as you get older, your ability to absorb B12 drops,” Boling points out. </li><li><strong>Calcium.</strong> Calcium is a crucial factor in building strong bones and having plenty in your diet lowers the risk of developing osteoporosis, Dr. Boling says. “Since women lose up to 1/5 of their bone [mass] in their first five to seven years after menopause, I tell all women that at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium is necessary on a daily basis,” says Gloria A. Bachmann, M.D., associate dean for women’s health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. If you don’t drink milk or eat dairy, supplementing with calcium is a must, Dr. Bachmann says. </li><li><strong>Vitamin D. </strong>The decline in estrogen that happens naturally during menopause can lead to bone loss, says women’s health expert Jennifer Wider, M.D. Vitamin D plays an essential role in building strong bones, she points out. </li><li><strong>Magnesium</strong>. Magnesium is also helpful at building strong bones and can help to lower the risk of leg cramps, Dr. Boling says. </li><li><strong>Fiber</strong>. Fiber can help with several factors, including keeping your regular, Keatley says. It also can help to regulate your blood sugar and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, she adds. (Just don’t take your fiber with medications or other vitamins, as it may carry them out of your body.)</li><li><strong>Riboflavin (B2).</strong> This is food for your eyes, skin, hair, and nails, Keatley says.</li><li><strong>Vitamin E.</strong> This antioxidant can help support your immune system, Keatley says. </li><li><strong>Folic Acid.</strong> “It’s good for the heart and proven to lower levels of homocysteine, which has been tied to heart disease,” Dr. Wider says. </li></ul><p>But there are more factors to consider besides ingredients. Pill size and dosage matter, too. If swallowing big pills isn’t for you, look for small-sized options or chewables. “Ideally, look for a vitamin with a recommended dose of one pill per day, versus multiple pills, as it is more likely to be taken,” adds Gans.</p><p>If you’re able, look for a multivitamin that’s third-party certified. This makes sure that what the label says is actually in the bottle, Gans points out. </p><p>It’s also not a bad idea to go with a company that’s popular. “A company that makes a lot of vitamins has a lot to lose if they don’t do what they claim to do,” Dr. Boling says. </p><p>*<em>Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.</em></p><h2>When is the best time to take multivitamins?</h2><p>There’s no hard and fast rule on the best time to take a multivitamin. In fact, experts agree that the best time to take a multivitamin is whenever you’re most likely to remember it. </p><p>If you really want specifics, taking a multivitamin with a meal may be helpful, per Gans. “But since a multivitamin includes fat-soluble vitamins, it would be best to take it with a meal that includes some fat, so the vitamins are more absorbed,” she explains. </p><p>Some multivitamins are also designed to be taken twice a day, which makes it a natural fit to take one in the morning and one at night. (Just check the label before you purchase a multivitamin for more details.)</p><h2>How we chose the best multivitamin for women over 50</h2><p>To choose the best multivitamins for women over 50, we analyzed the best-selling vitamins on the market and consulted several experts in nutrition and medicine, including: Jennifer Wider, M.D., women’s health expert, Gloria A.
