Adding in inflation, climate disasters, and political strife, it can seem as if the world's troubles are in our faces all the time. This stress is on top of daily work-related pressures. These strains can negatively affect employee mental wellness. So there's never been a better time for strong leadership that fosters positive mental health across your organization.</p><p>The stress caused by global uncertainties combined with daily work is not the "good" stress that energizes us and helps prepare us for action. It's the kind of overwhelming mental stress that leads to debilitating physical and emotional challenges, which then invades every nook and cranny of our lives--including the workplace whether onsite or remote. </p><p>I ran a business long enough to know that most leaders care deeply about the stability and mental well-being of their employees. What's more, as a certified public accountant firm owner, I also know that many professionals can lean less-emotion-over-more. We feel emotions to the core. We just don't feel comfortable expressing them. </p><p>With the mental well-being of employees at stake, it's time to change this dynamic. It's time for stronger leadership--the kind of leadership that goes beyond just building a financially successful business. It's time leaders served as a beacon of resilience and compassion, helping to steer employees through the tumultuous seas of uncertainty with a steady hand. </p><p>When I encourage you to encourage resilience and compassion, I'm not suggesting that you become your organization's resident Oprah. Rather, it's about being a leader who recognizes the mental health challenges that your employees face and works to create a culture where wellness is a priority. </p><p>Start by practicing the following principles that I believe compassionate leaders embrace: </p><h2>1. Offer psychological safety.</h2><p>Good leaders create a safe space for employees and always ensure they feel secure enough to express themselves without fear of negative consequences. This is important not only during times of workplace turmoil but also when there's external instability in the world at large. </p><p>For years as a business owner, I was consumed with the feeling of being busy, of having an endless list of to-dos that needed to be checked off. This mindset can quickly burn out staff. What I eventually learned was that my team didn't need a taskmaster, but rather, an empathetic leader who would take the time to ask them how they were doing and how I could help. They needed to feel psychologically safe. </p><h2>2. Communicate clearly and compassionately.</h2><p>Effective leaders communicate with clarity, transparency, and empathy. Clear and consistent communication will significantly reduce stress and anxiety among your team and provide a sense of direction and stability. </p><p>In the absence of clarity, team members are left to create their narratives. The door is left open to conflicting goals and objectives. To correct this situation in my firm, I implemented a structured communication program. The plan included an annual, all-team meeting at which we would review plans and goals and weekly leadership meetings to discuss status updates and changes to strategy. From there, leaders were accountable for cascading information to their teams. The result was transparency across the organization. </p><h2>3. Recognize and support your team.</h2><p>Whether your team's challenges are significant--family issues, health problems--or on a smaller scale, like trouble with a cranky client, great leaders acknowledge employees' efforts and provide emotional support to boost morale and affirm their value to the business. </p><p>To me, this recognition means engaging with my team beyond the workday. An acknowledgment can include an after-work cocktail, team dinners a few times a year, and everyday opportunities to simply say thank you. So much of creating a great work environment is just taking the time to make deeper connections and strengthen relationships. </p><h2>4. Be adaptable with your work demands.</h2><p>Leaders who practice conscious leadership adjust expectations and workloads to accommodate changing circumstances. This flexibility is an important way to protect your employees from burnout and help maintain a healthy work-life balance. </p><h2>5. Build trust and be consistent.</h2><p>Leaders who maintain a consistent approach and are careful to build trust lead healthier, more productive teams. This forms the bedrock of a resilient workplace culture that can weather the storm of both internal and external challenges. </p><p><em>Speed of Trust</em> (Free Press, 2008), by Stephen M.R. Covey, has served as a guide in the area of building trust. In my firm, I worked daily to build trust among leadership, team members, and clients. This effort took the form of sound, clear communications, transparency across the business, and taking the time to understand staff and client needs. Trust provides a solid foundation upon which organizations can grow and scale. </p><p>An organizational culture that's resilient in the face of adversity--as well as adaptive and forward-moving--doesn't only benefit the collective well-being and prosperity of its team. It also creates a positive ripple effect across clients, partners, and vendors. </p><p>As we make our way through uncertain times, the role of strong, effective leadership is more important than ever. Leaders who embody these positive attributes can help ease the resulting adverse effects on their team members' mental health wellness and turn challenges into opportunities for growth and development. </p><p>And on a more personal level, if your team knows they can depend on you to foster and maintain a strong, thriving, and compassionate work environment, you'll be the beacon they depend on and follow now and into the future. </p></main>
