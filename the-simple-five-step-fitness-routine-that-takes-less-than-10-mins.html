    <main><h1>The simple five-step fitness routine that takes less than 10 mins</h1><p>In our hectic lives, finding time to exercise often slips our minds, yet staying active is crucial for maintaining good health. </p><p>In fact, regular physical activity can help prevent or delay many age-related health issues – keeping us strong, preventing injury and contributing to our overall wellbeing. </p><p>Fortunately, fitness routines don’t have to be hard, time-consuming, or need much equipment and can be done in the comfort of your own home. </p><p>Anna Jenkins, 51, founder of We Are Fit Attitude (WAFA), suggests these easy steps: with all of these movements, warm up fully first and do each one for 30 seconds then rest for 30 seconds before repeating once or twice – so two to three sets in all.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Squat </h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chair squat</strong>:</h3><p>Sit on the edge of the chair, feet tucked underneath the knees, shoulders pulled back and back straight. Push through the heels to come to standing, then sit back down. Keep the body upright without leaning forward as you stand up.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Air squat:</strong> </h3><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1mzBXx_air_squat.jpg" alt="Air squat"><figcaption><em>The air squat (Picture: We Are Fit Attitude). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>Remove the chair and repeat the same movement. Chest needs to face forward to the opposite side of the room as you hinge the hips back, not allowing the body to collapseforward.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weighted squat: </strong></h3><p>Same as air squat, holding a weight at the chest.</p><h2 class="metro-factbox-title blue exclamation">                    While you're here...   </h2><p>This year Metro has partnered with the iconic charity parkrun to bring you a thriving new content series.</p><p>In a coming together of two game-changing powerhouses, Metro has been chosen as the first official media partner for parkrun as it celebrates its 20th birthday in 2024.</p><p>Did we mention it’s free (tick) and you only need to do it once (tick tick).</p><p><em>Register for parkrun here. The best part is that it’s free and you only need to register once. </em></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Push-Up</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wall push-up</strong>: </h3><p>Bring hands to chest level then extend hands to the wall. Step back, onto the balls of the feet so the body is at an angle to the wall. Widen the arms, then bend the elbows outwards bringing the body towards the wall, pushing back to start.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knee push-up:</strong></h3><p>Come onto hands and knees. Step both legs out to full extension in plank position and then drop the knees to the floor. Widen the hands, then bend the elbows, lowering the whole upper body forward and to the floor, hinging at the knees so that the bottom isn’t left behind. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1mzPIM_knee_push_up.jpg" alt="Knee push up"><figcaption><em>A classic push-up (Picture: We Are Fit Attitude). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Full push-up:</strong> </h3><p>Come onto hands and knees. Step both legs out to full extension in plank position. Widen the hands out to the side. Bend the elbows outwards allowing the whole body to drop to the floor. Then push the arms back to a straight position. Check the back doesn’t dip.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bicep curl/shoulder press</strong>: </h2><p>Hold dumbbells in each hand in front of you, arms down, palms facing away from the body, knuckles against your thighs. Roll the shoulders and pinch shoulder blades together. Elbows tucked into the body. Bend elbows, bringing the weights to chest level. Then twist the dumbbells so the palms are facing towards each other. Drive the dumbbells straight up to the ceiling, fully extending the arms. Bring arms back down. Twist hands so palms facing into the body and return the arms back to thigh level.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Row</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Standing row</strong>: </h3><p>For lower back issues, stand upright with shoulders pulled back. With dumbbells in each hand, bend elbows 90 degrees so weight comes to waist level, palms facing each other. With elbows tucked into the body, swing the weights outwards only moving the lower arm. Return back to the starting position. Imagine a swing door motion. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bent-over row: </strong></h3><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1mzRSN_bent_over_row.jpg" alt="Bent over row"><figcaption><em>The bent-over row (Picture: We Are Fit Attitude). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>Stand with dumbbells in each hand, arms straight. Roll shoulders back, pinch shoulder blades together. Slide the bottom back and hinge the body forward as if peering over a ledge. Let the arms come towards the floor with palms facing towards each other. Bend the elbows back and up towards the ceiling, bringing the weights up to the body then straighten the arms. Watch the shoulders don’t round.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Curl-Up</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Standing curl-up</strong>: </h3><figure><img title="Provided by Metro" src="IMG/BB1mzPIV_curl_up.jpg" alt="Curl up"><figcaption><em>A standing curl-up (Picture: We Are Fit Attitude). Provided by Metro</em></figcaption></figure><p>Two options. Bring hands behind the head with elbows pointing outwards or arms straight out in front. From there curl the shoulders forward while bringing the knee up to meet the chest. Come back to standing and repeat the same movement on the other leg. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lying curl-up</strong>: </h3><p>Place hands behind the head and put the weight of the head into the hands. Knees bent and feet flat to the floor. Do not pull the head upwards, just lift the shoulders up off the mat and then lie back.</p><p>Sitting upright, arms fully extended out in front. Curl from the base of the spine backwards. If you feel you are about to collapse, bring yourself back up the starting position. Alternatively, when curling back, come all the way to the floor, then lift the shoulders and curl back up to start position. Add a weight at chest height to make it that little bit more challenging. </p></main>
