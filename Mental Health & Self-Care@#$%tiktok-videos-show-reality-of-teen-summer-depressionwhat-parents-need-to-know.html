The summer months are typically seen as a time for fun, vacations, and play. But not everyone feels that way. On TikTok, there are thousands of videos of people discussing mental health challenges during the summer, including teens.</p><p>In one video, a teen shares, “Yes I wanna go out and have fun since it’s my last summer as a teen but I also get severely depressed and cut contact with everyone in my life every summer.”</p><p>Another shares a video of herself, writing, “Summer makes me sad...I just sit around all day waiting for tomorrow but it just becomes a constant loop.” Commenters make it clear she's not alone in her feelings, with one sharing, "I love feeling seen."</p><p>While it’s not a clinical term, summer depression isn’t just a trending topic on TikTok. “Summer depression is a form of seasonal depression characterized by many of the same symptoms as winter-based seasonal depression,” says Bonnie Scott, MA, LPC-S, a therapist and founder of Mindful Kindness Counseling.</p><p>Numbers vary, but Michele Goldman, PhD, a psychologist and Hope For Depression Research Foundation media advisor, says less than 10% of people who experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD) report it happening during the summer. But that percentage may not feel so small if it’s happening to your child. </p><p>Understanding the reasons and signs of mental health challenges in the summer can help parents navigate the issue with their children of all ages.</p><h2>Why Does Summer Affect Your Kid’s Mental Health?</h2><p>About 1 in 4 kids ages 3 to 17 have a mental, emotional, behavioral, or developmental disorder. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona wrote in a May, 2023 press release, “Students are six times more likely to access mental health when these services are offered in school.” But summer is a time when many students lose mental health care, and it can come during a period they need it most, experts say.</p><p>There are certain triggers that may lead to summer depression for children.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>Summer is generally linked with warmer weather, and temperatures have been rising because of climate change—2023 was the warmest year on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p><p>“This means that more teenagers with a sensitivity to temperature might be experiencing summer depression when they weren’t years ago when the temperature was cooler,” Dr. Goldman says.</p><h3>Less routine </h3><p>While some may relish not having to rush out the door or adhere to a predictable school schedule, others may find this lack of structure jarring.</p><p>“Many aspects of the day can change, which means changes in sleep, nutrition, structure, and productivity,” Dr. Goldman says. “This is one of the primary reasons children see a change in mood over summer months.”</p><h3>Expectations</h3><p>The idea that summer is “supposed” to be a season for fun and memories? It may be part of the problem for some children and adolescents.</p><p>“The pressure of having a perfect summer can contribute to stress-induced low points when this isn’t as realistic or doable for most,” says Brianna Paruolo, LCMHC, the founder and clinical director of On Par Therapy NYC. “There is a romanticization of the warmer months, with a warped perception of what it should look like and how kids/tweens/teens should spend it.”</p><h3>Lack of community/support</h3><p>Structure isn’t the only thing summer lacks.</p><p>“Depending on the child, they may have a significant support system and social outlet at school,” Dr. Goldman says. “This might be peers and relationships with teachers or other adults in the school. Children can feel much more isolated over summer months without that community.”</p><p>Camp can give a sense of community, but Dr. Goldman says some children may need time to adjust to peers and adults they see yearly. </p><p>“This can shift mood, create uncertainty in the child, and prompt feelings of isolation and lack of support,” she says.</p><h2>How To Help a Child Cope</h2><p>While summer can be challenging for children, parents can help them navigate their feelings.</p><h3>Know the signs</h3><p>It's critical to spot signs that your child may be struggling in the first place. Dr. Goldman says common depression symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Lack of motivation</li><li>Lack of interest in hobbies or interests </li><li>Isolation from friends</li><li>Difficulty concentrating</li><li>Feeling hopeless, helpless, guilty, or in despair</li></ul><p>“Depending on the age—and sometimes sex—of the child, there might be behavioral issues, like acting out, anger, and agitation,” adds Dr. Goldman. “If the child is [a teenager], there might be more of an existential dread or angst that is a symptom of summer depression.”</p><p>Sleep and appetite changes may also occur. “With winter depression, it is more common that people sleep more and have increased appetite,” Dr. Goldman says. “With summer depression, it is more common that people have difficulty with falling asleep or staying asleep—generally these folks sleep less overall in terms of quality and quantity—and have decreased appetite.”</p><p>Always make sure to consult a health care provider if you notice any of these changes. Dr. Goldman adds it’s important to consult a child’s health care provider about significant weight changes.</p><h3>Normalize the experience</h3><p>Nix ideas of what a summer “should” look like or that SAD can only happen in the winter.</p><p>“Having a conversation with your child/children expressing that it is OK to feel low helps them feel supported and seen,” Paruolo says. “Perhaps consider sharing with them times you have gone through seasonal depression and ways you coped with it. Emotions are signals from our body. Encourage your child to be in tune with their emotions and what they might be saying.”</p><h3>Create a schedule together</h3><p>The lack of routine doesn’t have to be a given during the summer. Paruolo recommends collaborating with your family on a summer schedule.</p><p>“A routine gives everyone a sense of purpose,” Paruolo says. “It may revolve around caring for the family pet in the morning or walking around the block to get a daily dose of sun and fresh air.”</p><p>Paruolo says the collaboration piece is key “so it truly feels like a group effort and not a demand being placed on them.”</p><h3>Go outside</h3><p>When the weather allows, take life outside.</p><p>“This one may seem obvious but is something that can fly under the radar with busy summer schedules,” says AJ Harris, MS, a Brightline behavioral health coach and care specialist. “Our children need time outside. Getting some sunshine and burning some energy is one of the best ways to boost dopamine in our brain, which can lead to more effective motivation toward other activities.”</p><h3>Monitor screen and social media time</h3><p>Less structure can prompt more screen time, including on social media.</p><p>“If your child/children are active on social media, introduce the concept of intentionality around using their favorite apps,” Paruolo says. “Perhaps, create a mood chart where the child ranks how they feel before and after using the app. Have open conversations about their experiences and encourage them to get curious about the content they consume, asking, ‘Did your experience tire you or inspire you?’”</p><p>If it’s a struggle, Dr. Goldman suggests this way to reduce screen time: “Increase events where devices are not going to be as present."</p><p>Think beach days and sporting events.</p><p>Ask for support from trusted family and friends if you need it. And again, always speak with your child's health care provider for advice and whether or not they recommend treatment.</p><p>“Seasonal depression is typically time-limited and tends to lift when the weather shifts," says Scott. "But that doesn't make it something to be flippant about."</p></main>
