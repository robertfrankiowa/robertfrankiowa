    <main><h1>The Biggest Diet Mistakes I Made Before Losing 160 Pounds</h1><h2>1 Starbucks Breakfast: 750 Calories</h2><p>"So a lot of the times on my way to work, I would stop and get a Venti Iced Cafe Mocha, which is 450 calories, and I would always get a chocolate croissant to go with that, so that's 300 calories," Amber revealed. "So we're already at 750 calories just for my breakfast. But again, it doesn't feel like that much because a coffee is really easy to drink and a croissant is very tiny."</p><figure><img title="1 Starbucks Breakfast: 750 Calories" src="IMG/AA1neLTP_1_starbucks_breakfast_750_calories.jpg" alt="1 Starbucks Breakfast: 750 Calories"><figcaption><em>1 Starbucks Breakfast: 750 Calories. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 McDonald's Lunch: 1,500 Calories</h2><p>"For lunch, I would go to McDonald's and I'd get a double Quarter Pounder meal with a large fry and a large drink," she continues. "And again, these are very easy to eat, very highly palatable foods, so it doesn't feel like you're eating that much. But the sandwich alone is another 740 calories. A large fry is 480, and I would get a Dr. Pepper, which is 280 calories."</p><figure><img title="2 McDonald's Lunch: 1,500 Calories" src="IMG/AA1neQSK_2_mcdonalds_lunch_1500_calories.jpg" alt="2 McDonald's Lunch: 1,500 Calories"><figcaption><em>2 McDonald's Lunch: 1,500 Calories. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Taco Bell Dinner: 1,240</h2><p>. And then for dinner it was very easy for me to just swing through Taco Bell and I would always get the two Chicken Chalupas combo. I would get a Cherry Pepsi, which is 390 calories. Each of the chicken chalupas is 340. And the soft taco I would get a soft taco is like 170 calories</p><figure><img title="3 Taco Bell Dinner: 1,240" src="IMG/AA1neLTU_3_taco_bell_dinner_1240.jpg" alt="3 Taco Bell Dinner: 1,240"><figcaption><em>3 Taco Bell Dinner: 1,240. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 She Was Confused Because She Was Only Eating Three Meals a Day</h2><p>"So again, I was like, I'm only eating three meals a day," she said about her pre-weight loss thought process. "How can I be putting on this weight?"</p><figure><img title="4 She Was Confused Because She Was Only Eating Three Meals a Day" src="IMG/BB1lEw3b_4_she_was_confused_because_she_was_only_eating_three_meals_a_day.jpg" alt="4 She Was Confused Because She Was Only Eating Three Meals a Day"><figcaption><em>4 She Was Confused Because She Was Only Eating Three Meals a Day. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 She Consumed 3,490 Calories</h2><p>Her grand total for the day? 3,490 calories. "Even at my heaviest, my eating calories were only 2,600 calories. So that's an additional almost 900 calories that I was consuming, and it didn't feel like it. That's exactly why it can feel like you're not eating that much, but it comes down to what you're eating," she said.</p><h2>6 Our Expert Weighs In</h2><p>Collingwood specifies that a lot of the problem is that she was getting over 1,000 calories "just from liquid calories!" she says. "Liquid calories don't fill you up at all, so that is part of the reason she didn't feel like she was eating that many calories." She adds that her diet had "very little fiber because there aren't fruits and vegetables or whole grains in her typical day." Why is that a bad thing? " Fiber fills you up which can help you feel more full and overall eat less," Collingwood states.
