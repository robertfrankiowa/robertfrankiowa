Here’s another quick and easy practice to add to your regimen: journaling.</p><p>The idea of keeping a journal may seem intimidating, but it’s easier than you might think. For starters, you don’t have to be great with words to journal. It also doesn’t require a lot of time. A few minutes a day can reap real benefits, whether you’re tapping out your thoughts in an app or writing them with a fancy pen in an elegant book. (Even a scrap of paper or the back of a napkin works in a pinch.)</p><p>Despite its benefits, however, journaling shouldn’t replace treatment by a mental health professional. “It does not take the place of therapy,” says <strong>Chivonna Childs PhD,</strong> a counseling psychologist for Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. “It should be used in conjunction with therapy if the problems are of significant concern.”</p><p>Think writing is right for you? Here’s how to get started.</p><h2>How can journaling help mental health?</h2><p>“Journaling can be a healthy way to express our innermost thoughts, get out our emotions or just empty our brains out,” Childs says. Think of journaling as an outlet for your anxieties, troubles, worries and fears. It can help you find clarity in situations that feel confusing and make peace with issues that are upsetting. Fact: The simple act of writing about strong emotions can lessen their intensity. Plus, journaling about things that are going well in life can create a shift from a negative to a more positive mindset.</p><p>What does science say about<strong> journaling for mental health</strong>? Journaling is associated with increased well-being and decreased mental distress, depressive symptoms and anxiety, a small study by researchers at Pennsylvania State University found. Other research shows journaling may reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and that writing about things you’re grateful for can improve your emotional state.</p><p>Just pay attention to how much you’re dwelling or fixating on negative thoughts or memories in your journal, as this can have a harmful effect on health. “The downside to journaling occurs when we’re perseverating on problems and not solutions,” Childs says.</p><h2>How to get started journaling for mental health</h2><p>There’s no right or wrong way to journal. Some people prefer to journal first thing in the morning to get ready for their day, while others prefer to write at night as part of their bedtime routine. Choose a time that works best for you: When do you have a spare five to 10 minutes to yourself to journal? What time of day are you most stressed? Does your daily to-do list feel overwhelming? Do you have trouble sleeping because you can’t quiet your mind?</p><p>“It should not feel like a pressure or a chore,” Childs says. “If you want to start with five minutes a day, that’s a good place. If you want to write until you’re tired of writing, that’s OK, too. Do what works for you.”</p><p>One type of journal isn’t necessarily better than another, either. The best journal is the one you’ll use, whether it’s a guided wellness or anxiety journal prefilled with prompts, a blank journal offering a clean slate for your thoughts, or an app or website.</p><h2>Different journaling techniques</h2><p>A journaling technique Childs recommends to her patients is the “brain dump,” where patients simply write down everything they’re thinking. “It does not have to make sense,” she says. “The only goal is to empty your mind of all the thoughts.” This approach can be helpful for people who have racing thoughts, she adds, as “transplanting” those thoughts from mind to paper may ease some of the brain’s frenetic pace.</p><p>Plus, over time, certain patterns or recurring thoughts may emerge in the writing. “This can also be a good way to organize your thoughts and see what themes are present, which might cue you to focus on areas you need to give attention to,” Childs adds.</p><p>Bullet journaling is another method that’s approachable, particularly for those who are new to journaling. You simply make bullet points of your thoughts as they come—no need for connected sentences or paragraphs. You could purchase a dedicated bullet journal, which typically looks more like a planner, or you could just make a list in a basic journal or on an app.</p><p>And finally, another easy type of journaling to try is a gratitude journal, which can help shift focus to the positive parts of your life. At the beginning or end of each day, take a few minutes to jot down a few things you’re grateful for—from the great cup of coffee you enjoyed in the morning to the sloppy kisses your dog gave you after work.</p><h2>25 journal prompts for mental health</h2><p>Want to write but not sure where to start?
