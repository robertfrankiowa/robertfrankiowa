    <main><h1>15 Influences of Money on Mental Health</h1><p>People love money, but there’s a reason it’s the second most common argument that leads married people to get divorced, families to split apart, and friends to drop each other like it’s hot.</p><p>According to a Business Insider survey, only 47% of those respondents aged 18-34 said they’d discuss money with their friends, which drops to just 25% for those aged 55 and over. Money has both positive and negative aspects. When it comes to mental health, there are some significant markers for how finances can affect mental well-being.</p><h2>1. Depression and Anxiety</h2><p>Money problems are never easy to deal with, and the more prolonged the financial issues, the more susceptible people become to mental health setbacks, including depression and anxiety.</p><h2>2. Self-Esteem and Confidence</h2><p>Both self-esteem and confidence can take a nosedive if a person is stressing over money. About 65% of women and 54% of men worry about money.</p><h2>3. Numero Uno</h2><p>According to a CreditWise survey, financial strain is the number one stressor in the United States. The survey reports that 73% of Americans are worried about their finances.</p><figure><img title="3. Numero Uno" src="IMG/BB1hKYkb_3_numero_uno.jpg" alt="3. Numero Uno"><figcaption><em>3. Numero Uno.

Costing Lives</h2><p>A 2023 survey from Health.com reports financial issues cause individuals to be as much as 20 times more likely to attempt to take their own lives because of their debt.</p><h2>5. Empathy</h2><p>More than one study has shown a correlation between money and empathy. Those with a lower economic status are better at reading facial expressions than their wealthier counterparts.</p><h2>6. Bad Money Cycles</h2><p>It’s easy to feel stuck when trying to deal with money and mental health. Poor mental health can make for poor money management. In turn, trying to deal with money and debt issues can contribute to poor mental health, which cycles right back to poor money management.</p><h2>7. Substance Abuse</h2><p>Multiple studies have shown that wealth and addiction are connected. Children who come from wealthy families are more susceptible to addiction and abuse issues, which can lead to or exacerbate mental health struggles.</p><figure><img title="7. Substance Abuse" src="IMG/BB1hKYkd_7_substance_abuse.jpg" alt="7. Substance Abuse"><figcaption><em>7. Substance Abuse. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8. Stigmas Stick</h2><p>Because of the stigma tied to debt, as well as mental health issues, people who are struggling with these issues are less likely to seek help for either problem.</p><figure><img title="8. Stigmas Stick" src="IMG/BB1hL06t_8_stigmas_stick.jpg" alt="8. Stigmas Stick"><figcaption><em>8. Stigmas Stick. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9. Long-Term Problems</h2><p>Just as mental health issues last longer for people with money problems, people with money problems also struggle with common mental health issues, like depression, for up to 18 months longer than people who aren’t having financial difficulties.</p><figure><img title="9. Long-Term Problems" src="IMG/BB1hKOkc_9_long_term_problems.jpg" alt="9. Long-Term Problems"><figcaption><em>9. Long-Term Problems. Image Credit: Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>10. Consistent Employment</h2><p>Adding to the financial strain of those suffering from mental health concerns is the difficulty they may have in keeping consistent employment. The more they stress over money, the harder it is to be motivated to work, exacerbating their money situation and high stress levels.</p><h2>11. Government Assistance</h2><p>In the United Kingdom, one-third of adults aged 16-64 (35%) claim housing benefits, and nearly half (47%) who receive some out-of-work benefit share a common mental health issue, such as depression or generalized anxiety disorder.</p><h2>12. Impulse Spending</h2><p>Undoubtedly, mental well-being correlates well with financial well-being, especially for those who suffer from financial impulsivity. If someone is unwell mentally, their money-management issues escalate, particularly when it comes to impulse spending.</p><p>93% spent more than usual<br> 92% found it more challenging to make financial decisions<br> 74% put off paying bills<br> 71% avoided dealing with creditors<br> 56% took out a loan they wouldn’t have otherwise applied for.<br> These numbers show the strong connection between mental health and financial stability.</p><h2>13. Asking For Help</h2><p>Three-quarters of those polled exhibited difficulty dealing with essential service workers. This scenario correlates with issues related to seeking help for money management concerns. People who suffer from mental health problems may close themselves off, making their financial concerns that much harder to tackle.</p><h2>14. Education</h2><p>Having a solid understanding of money management, common sense financial actions, and debt-handling tactics can go a long way toward helping to lower stress and increase mental health. The more tools you have to work with, the better your results, and this is especially true when it comes to money and mental health.</p><h2>15. Guilt and Shame</h2><p>For those who struggle with solid money choices due to mental health issues, a sense of overwhelming guilt or shame can accompany any financial decision that feels too important to handle. Making a decent decision can feel wrong, causing even more stress.</p><h2>Getting Help</h2><p>While those who suffer from mental health issues may not want to seek help with their money problems, getting some therapy may be the best financial decision they can make. It can help keep the worst of their symptoms at bay. Medications and even sharing with someone who doesn’t know the person well may be enough to help alleviate their symptoms and get them back on track financially.</p><h2>18 Ways to Save Without Sacrificing Life and Happiness</h2><p>Do you want a new perspective on saving money?
