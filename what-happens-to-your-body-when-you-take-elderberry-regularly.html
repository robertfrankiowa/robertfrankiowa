The age-old fruit, which has been growing in popularity, is a key ingredient in many immune-supportive supplements. Elderberries are rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, such as vitamin C, flavonoids and anthocyanins.</p><p>For centuries, this fruit has been a go-to therapy in folk medicine to treat fevers, flu and nasal congestion. “Today, elderberry is often added to dietary supplements and primarily marketed to support immune health and prevent the cold and flu,” says Vanessa King, M.S., RDN, CDCES, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>There’s plenty of elderberry to go around, and you'll find many options for the picking.“You’ll find more than 27,000 products containing elderberries on the market and in many forms—extracts, tinctures, juices, syrups, lozenges, tablets, capsules and chewable gummies,” says King.</p><p>Since maintaining a healthy immune system is important for your well-being, you may wonder if elderberry should be the latest addition to your wellness regime. Read on to learn more about what happens when you take elderberry regularly. </p><h2>What Is Elderberry?</h2><p>Elderberries are shiny, black edible fruits that grow in clusters on plant shrubs, scientifically named <em>Sambucus nigra</em>. These bush-like plant shrubs, known as <em>black elders</em>, grow abundantly in America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Ripe and ready elderberries are used to make cakes, pies, jellies, jams and beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.</p><p>Similar to other fruits with deep purple and blue hues, elderberries are high in anthocyanins and flavonoids, which are natural antioxidant compounds that may be responsible for many of their health benefits. </p><h2>Health Benefits of Elderberry</h2><h3>May Shorten Your Cold Duration</h3><p>Many may reach for the nearest cold-fighting supplement when a sniffly nose or an itchy throat persists. However, keeping elderberry in your medicine cabinet may also be beneficial when you are feeling under the weather. “When taken at the early onset of the common cold or flu, elderberry has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms or potentially prevent them altogether,” says Wendimere Reilly, RDN, LDN, member of the Nature’s Sunshine scientific advisory board.</p><h3>Might Support Your Immunity</h3><p>Taking elderberry may do more than speed up your cold recovery; it may further support immune health. Research has shown that elderberry supplementation may help significantly reduce upper respiratory symptoms. Often, upper respiratory infections are treated with medications, including anti-viral medications. Anthocyanins have been shown to reduce the likelihood of viral infections surprisingly directly. Viral glycoproteins (a compound found in viruses) act as an open door to viruses, but anthocyanins prevent viruses from entering the body by attaching themselves to these glycoproteins.</p><h3>May Reduce Inflammation and Your Risk of Disease</h3><p>Inflammation is a normal part of your body's inner workings, but if it gets out of hand, it can wreak havoc on your health. “Free radicals contribute to inflammation, and our bodies are exposed to free radicals daily. They accumulate in our bodies for many reasons, including pollution exposure, stress, and even normal bodily functions,” says Pam Hartnett, M.P.H., RDN, a cancer recovery coach. Free radicals can cause harm to healthy body cells by creating what’s called oxidative stress. Both oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are associated with chronic diseases such as heart disease, arthritis and some types of cancer, says Harnett. Given their antioxidant power, elderberries may drive away the undesirable effects of oxidative stress and free radicals. “Elderberries’ polyphenols, such as anthocyanins and flavonols, may help reduce this oxidative stress and inflammation,” says Harnett.</p><h3>May Slow Certain Cancer Growth</h3><p>“What’s exciting is that some studies show that elderberry extract may slow the growth of certain cancers by preventing angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels grow to deliver nutrients to tumors,” says Hartnett.</p><p>“Furthermore, elderberry extract may also inhibit the migration of cancer cells, also known as metastasis. In this way, elderberry extract may prevent the spread of cancer to other parts of the body,” says Harnett.</p><p>Unfortunately, research on the benefits of elderberries in real-life people is limited. Because most of the studies were conducted in a lab (think test tube and petri dish), more human-based studies are needed to confirm or dispel these anticancer effects.</p><p>Elderberries possess a powerful punch of fiber, with 10 grams of fiber in every cup. While most Americans don’t eat enough fiber, its health benefits make it a must-have nutrient. Fiber can support weight loss, relieve constipation, contribute to healthy blood sugar balance, and aid digestion for good gut health. More specifically, your gut bacteria ferments fiber in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract and produces short-chain fatty acids, positively impacting the gut and lowering inflammation. Further, elderberries’ polyphenols may function as prebiotics, which is fodder for your good gut bacteria. Prebiotics allow gut bacteria to survive and multiply for a well-functioning gut microbiome.</p><h2>Elderberry Nutrition Facts</h2><p>Small but mighty, elderberry fruits are chock-full of nutrition thanks to their dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals richness. As for fiber, one cup of elderberries delivers 10 grams in one fell swoop. Not to mention, the same serving offers potassium and noteworthy levels of iron. Elderberries are exceptionally high in vitamin C, giving 58% of the daily value (DV), which is 90 mg for adults and children 4 years and older. Eating foods with vitamin C contributes to a healthy immune system, as low vitamin C levels make you more illness-prone.</p><p>Here’s a nutrition breakdown of one cup of elderberries:</p><p><p><strong>Calories:</strong> 106</p><p><strong>Total Carbohydrates: </strong>26 g</p><p><strong>Dietary Fiber: </strong>10 g</p><p><strong>Protein: </strong>1 g</p><p><strong>Total Fat:</strong> 1 g</p><p><strong>Saturated Fat: </strong>0 g</p><p><strong>Sodium: </strong>9 mg</p><p><strong>Potassium</strong>: 406 mg (9% DV)</p><p><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> 52 mg (58% DV)</p><p><strong>Iron:</strong> 2 mg (13% DV)</p><p>Elderberry contains compounds known to have health-promoting, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and immune-supporting effects: antioxidants, vitamin C, flavonoids, especially anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and dietary fiber, says King.  She shares that elderberry nutrients and plant compounds have health benefits and may help your body fight viruses, reduce inflammation and improve your immune system.</p><h2>Potential Downsides and Precautions</h2><p>Elderberries are distinct from popular purple produce because eating them raw can make you sick, while the latter can be enjoyed naturally. It's crucial to be cautious when ingesting other plant parts as well, which were commonly used in medications in earlier times. “Certain parts of the elderberry plant, like its bark, leaves, stems, seeds, unripe and raw fruit, can be toxic, causing dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration,” says King. </p><p>Sambunigrin is the toxin King mentions, which is a poisonous cyanogenic glycoside. “Consuming large quantities of this toxin can cause serious illness. However, cooking destroys it,” says King. </p><h2>Who Should Avoid Taking an Elderberry Supplement?</h2><p>While elderberry supplements are widely available on store shelves, they are not suitable for everyone. King notes that elderberries aren't recommended during pregnancy because their safety is unknown for both parent and child.  </p><p>Further, people who are immunocompromised may need to seek an alternative remedy. “Elderberry may stimulate the immune system, which may be contraindicated for patients taking immunosuppressant agents,” says King. </p><p>Medications may interact with natural remedies such as elderberry, so speaking with your doctor before starting any new supplement is vital. According to King, elderberry may mimic the effects of laxatives and diuretics, so taking them simultaneously could put your health at risk.</p><h2>What to Look for in an Elderberry Supplement</h2><p>Knowing what to look for when buying a supplement is not so clear-cut. But there are simple ways to narrow the search.“You should only consume elderberries from a reliable, quality source,” says Reilly. When choosing a reliable elderberry supplement, look for a product that has been third-party tested. You’ll know by checking the product’s label for a seal that may say NSF Sport, USP Verified, BSCG certified or INFORMED certified. Bearing these certifications means the product contains what it claims.</p><p>Another thing to check is the sugar content. Many elderberry products, like gummies, could be packed with added sugar. Since elderberries are naturally sweet, see an option free of added sugars if possible.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Elderberry is a natural go-to for supporting immunity and easing cold and flu symptoms. Packed with fiber, vitamin C and antioxidants, it helps fight inflammation and helps keep you healthy. So, is it safe to take elderberry regularly? “Possibly, but that doesn’t mean you should. No long-term studies substantiate the safety or potential risk of daily elderberry consumption,” says Reilly. Sticking to a healthy, well-balanced diet is the best you can do to support your wellness. “There’s stronger evidence supporting the health benefits of consuming a diverse range of colorful fruits, vegetables, spices and botanicals for overall health benefits,” says Reilly. “As the saying goes, variety is the spice of life.”</p><p>    <strong>What is the benefit of elderberry?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Elderberry is a highly nutritious fruit packed with fiber, iron, vitamin C, and antioxidants, which contribute to its benefits, such as supporting your immune system, helping relieve cold and flu symptoms and improving your digestive health.</p><p>    <strong>Is it safe to take elderberry every day?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>The short answer is that science has yet to tell us. “No long-term studies substantiate the safety or potential risk of daily elderberry consumption,” says Reilly. Further, the FDA doesn’t approve dietary supplements for safety before going to market. So, it's always wise to talk to your trusted healthcare provider about the supplements you plan to take and how often you will take them.</p><p>    <strong>What is elderberry most commonly used for?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Some take elderberry supplements regularly during cold and flu season to keep their health in check. Aside from prevention, elderberry is more commonly used to help people overcome sicknesses at the onset. It’s available in many forms, including juices, syrups, capsules and gummies. </p><p>    <strong>Who should not take elderberry?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Elderberry supplements can be risky to use for people who are pregnant, children, immunocompromised or taking medications including laxatives and diuretics. More research would help determine if more groups should avoid taking elderberry.</p></main></body>
