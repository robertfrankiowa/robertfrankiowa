Vats</h2><h5>Doctor of Medicine (MBBS) · 1.5 years of experience · India</h5><p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of how polluted the air is. It is calculated based on the levels of different air pollutants, such as ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide. The AQI has six categories, ranging from good to hazardous. The health risks and symptoms associated with different AQI categories vary depending on the individual and the pollutants present in the air. However, in general, the higher the AQI, the greater the health risks. Good (0-50): Air quality is considered satisfactory and poses little or no risk to public health. Moderate (51-100): Air quality is acceptable; however, there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): Air quality is unhealthy for people who are sensitive to air pollution, such as children, older adults, and people with respiratory problems. People in this group may experience symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and/or irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Unhealthy (151-200): Air quality is unhealthy for everyone. People may experience symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and/or irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children are at greater risk for more serious health effects. Very Unhealthy (201-300): Air quality is very unhealthy. Everyone may experience significant health effects, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and/or aggravation of heart or lung diseases. People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children are at greater risk for more serious health effects. Hazardous (301-500): Air quality is hazardous. Everyone may experience serious health effects, and the risk of death increases. Stay indoors, especially if you have heart or lung disease, older adults, and children. </p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to Impact Of Air Quality On Health.</b></p><h2>Expert opinion from Dr. Anet Varghese</h2><h5>Doctor of Medicine (MBBS) · 1 years of experience · India</h5><p>There are six AQI categories, namely Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe.

However, there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups for an index from 101 to 150(Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to be affected), Unhealthy for an index group from 151 to 200(Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects), Very Unhealthy for 201 to 300(The risk of health effects is increased for everyone), Hazardous from 301 and above(Health warning of emergency conditions everyone is more likely to be affected). </p><p><p>→ <b>See more questions and expert answers related to Impact Of Air Quality On Health.</b></p><h2>Expert opinion from Dr. Mayank Saxena</h2><h5>Doctor of Medicine (MBBS) · 1 years of experience · India</h5><p>The health risks associated with poor quality of air are many, some of which are inflammation of the respiratory tract, some cardiovascular effects, and allergic reactions to the allergens present in the air.</p><p><table><tr><th>What are people curious about?</th></tr><tr><td>Crohn's disease</td><td>Multiple myeloma</td></tr><tr><td>Chronic kidney disease</td><td>Epidermal growth factor receptor</td></tr></table></main>
