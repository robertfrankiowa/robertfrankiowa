    <main><h1>Why Do I Get Heartburn at Night? Causes and Treatment</h1><p>Heartburn is a painful burning sensation in your chest or throat. It occurs when stomach acid backs up into your esophagus. Heartburn is especially common at night because lying down prevents gravity from keeping acids in your stomach, where they belong.</p><p>The most common nighttime heartburn symptom is a burning sensation in the chest. Some people also experience regurgitation, in which stomach acids rise into the throat and mouth.</p><p>Common causes of nighttime heartburn include consuming certain foods, eating too close to bedtime, and taking particular prescription medications. Heartburn at night could be a sign of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p>This article explains simple home remedies that can help ease symptoms while you work with a healthcare provider to find a more permanent solution.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1o6iVY_man_with_chest_pain_in_bed.jpg" alt="Man with chest pain in bed"><figcaption><em>ozgurcankaya / Getty Images.

There are multiple causes of acid reflux at night, including:</p><ul><li>Having obesity</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Smoking</li><li>Some medications, including benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers (high blood pressure medication), some asthma medicines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and tricyclic antidepressants</li></ul><p>In addition, certain foods can cause heartburn in some people. These include:</p><ul><li>Acidic foods</li><li>Alcohol</li><li>Caffeine</li><li>Coffee</li><li>High-fat foods</li><li>Mint</li><li>Spicy foods</li></ul><p>Because digestion slows as you sleep, you have an increased likelihood of experiencing heartburn at night.</p><h3>Heartburn in Pregnancy</h3><p>Heartburn in pregnancy is common. That's because changing hormones and added pressure on the abdomen create an atmosphere ripe for the condition. Research suggests between 17% and 45% of pregnant people experience heartburn during pregnancy.</p><h2>Home Remedies for Heartburn at Night</h2><p>Fortunately, there are many remedies for heartburn at night. Since everyone responds differently, you may need to experiment with a few before finding one that works for you.</p><h3>Sleep on the Left Side of the Body</h3><p>Research has found that sleeping on your left side may reduce the incidence of nighttime acid reflux. A study compared nighttime heartburn symptoms of left-side sleeping to right-side and back sleeping. It found that left-side sleeping reduced symptoms.</p><h3>Elevate the Head and Chest</h3><p>Another tried-and-true remedy for nighttime heartburn is to elevate the head and chest. This works by enlisting gravity to keep stomach acids from rising into the esophagus. Some research has found that elevation is effective at reducing nighttime symptoms but not at improving quality of life. That may be because many people don't prefer to sleep elevated.</p><p>You can boost the head of your bed by placing blocks under the feet of your bed or by using special acid reflux pillows or other devices intended to help you sleep elevated.</p><h3>Weight Management</h3><p>Since obesity and excess weight are risk factors for developing heartburn, losing weight or maintaining a weight that's healthy for you may be another way to manage or prevent heartburn. Research has found a positive association between weight loss and reduced heartburn symptoms.</p><h3>Avoid Tight Clothing</h3><p>Tight or restrictive clothing may make heartburn worse. That's because tight clothing around the stomach can restrict the stomach and intestines, resulting in more difficulty with digestion. So stick to loose bedtime clothing, like nightgowns, loose-fitting pajama pants or sweats.</p><h3>Avoid Late-Night Snacking</h3><p>Eating close to bedtime is a no-no if you experience nighttime heartburn. If your stomach doesn't have a chance to empty before bed, you're more likely to experience heartburn when you try to sleep.</p><p>Researchers have found that the closer you eat to bedtime, the more likely you are to experience sleep interruption. Experts recommend that you stop eating about three hours before bedtime to give your body a chance to fully digest your last meal before sleeping.</p><h3>Eat Smaller Meals</h3><p>In addition, eating more frequent, smaller meals instead of three larger meals may help. This may reduce stomach distention or relaxation of the esophageal sphincter.</p><p>Research has found that those who eat larger meals experience more acid reflux than those who eat smaller, more frequent meals. One study compared participants who ate a 600 milliliter (mL) liquid test meal three times a day and then ate a 300 mL liquid test meal six times a day.</p><p>Compared to the smaller meal days, participants' reflux episodes were more frequent and lasted longer during the larger meal days.</p><h3>Avoid Trigger Foods</h3><p>It's hard to know which foods will cause heartburn in you since reactions to foods can vary. You may need to track your food and associated symptoms in a food diary for a while before finding the triggers.</p><p>Some common triggers are:</p><ul><li>Acidic foods</li><li>Alcohol</li><li>Caffeine</li><li>Coffee</li><li>High-fat foods</li><li>Mint</li><li>Spicy foods</li></ul><h3>Quit Smoking</h3><p>If you're a smoker, quitting may be just the thing to get rid of heartburn. The reason smoking is a risk factor for heartburn is that tobacco smoke reduces sphincter pressure and saliva production. Researchers have found that quitting smoking can alleviate heartburn symptoms.</p><h3>Check Medication Side Effects</h3><p>Since many medication side effects include a risk of heartburn, it's a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider if you take any medications and experience heartburn. The most common culprits are:</p><ul><li>Antibiotics</li><li>Some heart medication</li><li>Some asthma medicines</li><li>NSAIDs, including Advil or Motrin (ibuprofen) and Aleve (naproxen)</li></ul><h2>Over-the-Counter Medications for Heartburn</h2><p>Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can sometimes offer the most immediate heartburn relief. So, if you're looking to stop heartburn as soon as possible and the above remedies have not helped, you might try antacids or acid reducers.</p><p>Antacids provide fast relief from heartburn symptoms. They work by neutralizing stomach acid. Common OTC antacids include:</p><ul><li>Mylanta</li><li>Rolaids</li><li>Tums</li></ul><p>Antacids may cause other gastrointestinal problems in some people, including diarrhea, constipation, and kidney stones. They may also increase your risk of bone fractures if you use them too much, so use only use them for short-term relief.</p><p>People with kidney disease, high blood pressure, and heart disease should talk to a healthcare provider before taking antacids.</p><p>Acid reducers reduce the amount of acid the stomach produces. These medications may be H2 blockers (histamine type-2 receptor antagonists) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).</p><p>H2 blockers work faster, suppressing acid production within one to three hours. Relief usually lasts a few hours. PPIs, on the other hand, are not intended for immediate relief. These acid reducers can take one to four days to start working.</p><p>OTC PPIs can only be used for up to two weeks and only up to three times per year. Acid reducers may interact with certain medications, so talk to a healthcare provider before using them.</p><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Should you be worried if you get heartburn every day? Constant heartburn is a good reason to see a healthcare provider. They will be able to help identify the cause of your heartburn. They will also help you figure out a treatment plan.</p><p>Some other good reasons to see a healthcare provider for your nighttime heartburn include:</p><ul><li>Your symptoms don't improve with at-home or OTC treatment.</li><li>You experience chest pain.</li><li>You lose your appetite.</li><li>You experience persistent vomiting.</li><li>You have dysphagia(trouble swallowing).</li><li>You are vomiting blood or what looks like coffee grounds.</li><li>You have bloody or black stools.</li><li>You have unexplained weight loss.</li></ul><p>It's important to seek help for persistent or severe symptoms. Ongoing heartburn can damage the esophageal lining, leading to long-term problems.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Nighttime heartburn is a common problem. When you lie down, you lose the effect of gravity to help keep acid in the stomach. Fortunately, many at-home remedies, lifestyle changes, and OTC medications can resolve the problem. However, when the problem is severe or frequent, it's a good idea to get evaluated by a healthcare provider.</p></main>
