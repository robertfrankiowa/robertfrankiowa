Getting enough quality sleep has been linked with a healthy heart, glowing skin and healthy weight. Not getting enough quality sleep over time can increase your risk of chronic disease, including diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and poor mental health. </p><p>While getting a good night’s sleep can be easier said than done, a new study published in <em>Epidemiology</em> might have at least one answer for getting more restful shut-eye.</p><h2><strong>How Was the Study Conducted?</strong></h2><p>Researchers drew their data from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, an international, population-based, multicenter cohort study of asthma and allergic disease, which was first carried out in 1990. The surveys used for this study spanned 10 years. </p><p>The researchers were looking for correlations between physical activity and insomnia, sleep time and daytime sleepiness.  </p><p>There were 4,339 participants, and about half were male and half were female. Participants filled out the survey, which included questions on lifestyle, respiratory symptoms, smoking history and general health. Their height and weight were also measured and BMI was calculated.</p><p>Participants who reported that they exercised at least two or more times a week, for at least one hour per week, were classified as being physically active—anything less than that was considered non-active. </p><p>Researchers developed four group classifications for activity status that participants were placed into as their data for the 10 years was examined. Changes in activity status were categorized into four groups: persistently non-active, became inactive, became active, and persistently active.</p><p>Participants also answered questions about their sleep-related symptoms, including the frequency of insomnia. Daytime sleepiness was evaluated using a valid sleepiness scale that measures daytime sleepiness based on the likelihood of falling asleep in eight different situations. Finally, they were asked about how much sleep they averaged each night. </p><h2><strong>What Did The Study Find?</strong></h2><p>Researchers found that persistently active participants were the least likely to report having two or three insomnia symptoms. Specifically, those who were consistently active over the 10 years were 71% more likely to be normal sleepers.</p><p>In other words, participants who reported being physically active at the beginning and end of the 10-year study period were less likely to report insomnia symptoms at follow-up. They also found that those who were consistently active were more likely to sleep the recommended 6 to 9 hours a night. </p><p>After the data was adjusted for certain demographics—like age, sex, BMI and smoking history—to reduce bias, the results remained the same. This helps strengthen the correlation between physical activity and quality sleep.</p><p>Interestingly, those who reported being physically active at the beginning of the study period but became inactive by the end did not benefit from previously being active. The same goes for those who were not physically active at baseline but eventually became active. This emphasizes the importance of being consistently active over the long haul. </p><h2><strong>Why Does It Matter?</strong></h2><p>We previously reported how sleep and inflammation are related and how this in turn affects various aspects of our health—including immune health, depression and weight management. And when you’re exhausted, you’re less likely to exercise. It also can impact the hormones responsible for hunger and satiety, which may encourage you to overeat. </p><p>What this study suggests is that regularly exercising could help you sleep better. The researchers also found a correlation between other health habits—like a balanced diet—and those who were consistent exercisers. In other words, those who exercised also tended to engage in other healthy habits—which may also ultimately contribute to getting a good night’s sleep. </p><p>If you are a regular exerciser and find that you’re commonly running short on quality sleep, consider other factors. What is your sleep environment like? Is it chaotic or does it welcome sleep? What is your bedtime routine like? Are you getting off your devices well before bedtime and reducing the light you’re exposed to? </p><p>What time are you eating dinner? Eating a large meal before bedtime, having caffeine too late in the day or imbibing too close to bedtime could interrupt sleep, too. </p><p>Sleep apnea can also disrupt sleep and is highly correlated with heart issues. If you’re doing everything you can to sleep well—especially if you know you snore—and are still exhausted, it might be worth a visit to your healthcare practitioner. </p><h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>Sleep is vital to living a healthy, happy life. This study showed a correlation between being consistently physically active for over a decade and a reduced risk of insomnia. Many other things also contribute to quality sleep, including diet, stress, alcohol, bedtime routine—even your partner’s sleep habits. Examine what habits you could tweak to get a better night’s sleep—and be consistent with them over the long haul.</p></main>
