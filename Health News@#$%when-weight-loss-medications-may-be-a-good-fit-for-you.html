    <main><h1>When Weight Loss Medications May Be a Good Fit for You</h1><p><p>Angela Fitch, MD, is board-certified in obesity medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics. She is the president of the Obesity Medicine Association, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, and a board member of the Obesity Action Coalition.</p><p> <p>Obesity is a chronic disease affecting over 42% of adults in the United States. It is characterized by excess body fat and is closely linked to other diseases like heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and sleep apnea (a condition that can cause breathing to stop and restart during sleep).</p><p>As an obesity medicine specialist, I understand that excess weight isn't always caused by eating too many calories or not exercising. Genetics, hormone imbalances, and metabolic issues can also contribute to the disease. And, for many, lifestyle change alone isn't enough to lose weight and keep it off.</p><p>Similar to other diseases, obesity is more effectively treated by combining lifestyle modification with medication, surgery, or other treatments. With the addition of medication, we see 15% to 20% weight loss, improving the long-term health outcomes of the disease.</p><h2>Am I a Good Candidate for Weight Loss Medications?</h2><p>It’s rare to find someone who is not a good candidate for weight loss medication or surgery if they meet current prescribing standards. To be eligible for the addition of medication to lifestyle interventions, you must have:</p><ul><li>A body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater</li><li>A BMI of 27 or greater with an obesity-related complication such as high blood pressure or diabetes</li></ul><p>We take a good medical history and perform a comprehensive assessment in a shared decision-making fashion to determine the best treatment for any chronic disease, and obesity should be no different.</p><p><p>"I understand that excess weight isn't always caused by eating too many calories or not exercising."</p><p> <h2>What to Know About Weight Loss Medication</h2><p>First, I want you to know that it is not “weight loss medication.” It is obesity treatment. We are treating a chronic disease, not just trying to lose weight.</p><p>People should work to improve health issues and become “leaner, not lighter.” This means we want to lose excess fat that leads to poor health and increase our muscle mass, leading to better longevity. It has nothing to do with weight and everything to do with health and long-term improvement in quality of life. The focus should be on body composition and well-being—not on a number on the scale.</p><p>About 90% of people will need ongoing medication if they wish to keep the disease treated. Engaging in the treatment of obesity should be something you do for the long run, not for the short term.</p><p>Most importantly, I want people to understand that gaining weight back means it is harder to treat the next time. So, you must continue working with your healthcare team to maintain your weight loss in the long term. I recommend getting care from someone you can see regularly.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Once you’ve started on weight loss medication, it’s essential to adopt healthy habits, including:</p><ul><li>Regular physical activity</li><li>Healthy eating</li><li>Stress management</li><li>Adequate sleep </li></ul><p>Treating and managing obesity is a long journey, not a short sprint. As a chronic disease, it requires long-term disease management, not episodic short-term care.</p><p><p>"I want you to know that it is not “weight loss medication.” It is obesity treatment. We are treating a chronic disease, not just trying to lose weight. "</p><h2>Working With a Dietitian</h2><p>Working on our nutritional quality, including planned portions of plants and protein and reduction in ultra-processed food intake, is critical to our long-term health regardless of our weight. </p><p>I recommend that everyone, including people on weight loss medications, work with a dietitian to make sure they are optimizing their diet to the best they are able to do.</p><h2>What to Ask Your Medical Provider About Weight Loss Medication?</h2><p>Ask to have treatment. Many clinicians hold the same biased views of the world that diet and exercise treat the disease of obesity effectively when they don’t do that alone.</p><p>Being proactive and informed as a patient means talking to your healthcare provider about medication for obesity treatment. Ask for a referral to someone who can offer obesity treatment options, including surgery, which is the most effective treatment, if you are not comfortable discussing it with your healthcare provider.</p><p><em>As told to Lindsey DeSoto, RD, LD</em></p>
