    <main><h1>The Best Foods For Postpartum: What To Eat After Giving Birth</h1><h2>Beans</h2><p>Beans are inexpensive and relatively quick and easy to make. They also happen to make a great addition to any postpartum menu because they're high in fiber, folate, protein, and zinc. "Fiber is important for regular bowel function after vaginal delivery (especially if it was a difficult delivery with or without tears) or c-section," says Dr. Kelly Culwell, a board-certified OB-GYN who's also known as the Dr. Lady Doctor.</p><h2>Beef and Poultry</h2><p>Don't shy away from animal proteins, especially beef and poultry. According to Culwell, protein is needed to support the high protein demands of breastfeeding. Stews and homemade soups are effortless ways to whip up protein heavy-dishes.</p><figure><img title="Beef and Poultry" src="IMG/AA1l9BUU_beef_and_poultry.jpg" alt="Beef and Poultry"><figcaption><em>Beef and Poultry.

Beyond being a source of protein, they have plenty of vitamins A, B2, B6, B12, and zinc. Due to the minerals that are excreted from producing breast milk, Culwell recommends getting more of these vitamins. </p><h2>Eggs</h2><p>Eggs are nutritious and let's face it, they're easy to incorporate into your diet. They're also rich in iodine along with other vitamins. "Why iodine you ask?," says Culwell. "The need for increased iodine is [important] to support infant growth and neurologic development by providing sufficient iodine in breastmilk."</p><figure><img title="Eggs" src="IMG/AA1l9BV0_eggs.jpg" alt="Eggs"><figcaption><em>Eggs.

"Due to the mercury content of fish, people who are breastfeeding should eat no more than two, four-ounce servings per week of fish like canned light tuna, catfish, pollock, salmon, and shrimp or one serving a week of fish like albacore tuna, bluefish, and yellowfin tuna," shares Culwell. </p><h2>Fruit</h2><p>Citrus fruits and strawberries are high in fiber and vitamin A proving they're great postpartum food options. Enjoy a slice of fruit as a snack or pair it with other recommended ingredients like milk for a fun smoothie.</p><h2>Leafy Greens</h2><p>Stock your refrigerator up with leafy greens as they have vitamins A and E, fiber, and folate. Add them to a salad, blend them up in a smoothie, or saute them for a side dish. </p><figure><img title="Leafy Greens" src="IMG/AA1l9skS_leafy_greens.jpg" alt="Leafy Greens"><figcaption><em>Leafy Greens. haoliang - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Nuts and Seeds</h2><p>Nuts and seeds are dream snacks and when it comes to the postpartum period, they'll leave you with all the fiber, protein, vitamins B1 and E you need. </p><figure><img title="Nuts and Seeds" src="IMG/AA1l9IvV_nuts_and_seeds.jpg" alt="Nuts and Seeds"><figcaption><em>Nuts and Seeds.

Not only is it perfect for moms with busy schedules, it has fiber, protein, and vitamin B6. It's a win-win.</p><h2>Tomatoes</h2><p>Tomatoes may not come to mind, but they have lots of vitamins A and C so they're worth throwing on a salad, sandwich, or bowl of pasta. Keep them handy in your kitchen.</p><h2>Whole Grain Foods</h2><p>You should be eating whole-grain foods like whole-wheat bread or pasta. They're solid ways to get the fiber and zinc your body could use more of. </p></main>
