    <main><h1>6 Celebrities With Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: Bruce Willis, Wendy Williams and More</h1><h2>Steve Lawrence</h2><p>Longtime Las Vegas entertainer and actor <strong>Steve Lawrence</strong>, 88, revealed in June 2019 that he was diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. </p><p>In an open letter to fans, Lawrence said, “I want my beloved fans to know that in spite of this bittersweet moment, what I don’t want is pity or sympathy. I have lived and am living a wonderful, joyous life filled with love, support and amazing moments. With my beloved <strong>Eydie [Gormé]</strong>, I had one of the great loves of all time; my career has always been there for me as a source of joy and fulfillment; and you, my fans, have shown immeasurable love and support in ways I only could have imagined.” </p><p>Singers Lawrence and Gormé were married in Las Vegas on December 29, 1957, during her first solo engagement on the Strip. They were first billed as a couple at the Sahara in 1961, went on to become regulars at the Sands and Caesars Palace, and made frequent appearances on TV. </p><p>Gormé died in 2013 at age 84 following a brief, undisclosed illness.</p><p>Lawrence, on the other hand, died from complications of his Alzheimer's disease on March 7.</p><figure><img title="Steve Lawrence" src="IMG/BB1pyP2O_steve_lawrence.jpg" alt="Steve Lawrence"><figcaption><em>Steve Lawrence.

She has dementia, and is unable to remember her career at all.” She earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as well as a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer in 1964. </p><p>She was married three times — first to ad exec <strong>Peter Griffith</strong> in 1952, then to her agent <strong>Noel Marshall</strong>, before the two divorced in 1982, and three years later she tied the knot with businessman <strong>Luis Barrenechea</strong>, but they split in 1995.</p><figure><img title="Tippi Hedren" src="IMG/BB1pywwx_tippi_hedren.jpg" alt="Tippi Hedren"><figcaption><em>Tippi Hedren.

He only retired due to Alzheimer’s,” his daughter <strong>Kathaleen</strong> said. “He was embarrassed by it. He lived in fear the public would find out.” </p><p>Jack's wife, <strong>Suzi</strong>, said he didn’t want the public to know his diagnosis. After the Columbus Zoo, which he was no longer directing, faced problems that included losing its main accreditation, some sought a response from him. So, the family decided to reveal his diagnosis in 2021. </p><p>Suzi said it “killed her” to break her promise and go public about his condition. </p><p>“If this helps even one other family, it’s more than worth sharing dad’s story,” said Kathaleen. “He spent a lifetime helping everyone he could. He will never know it or understand it, but he is still doing it now.”</p><figure><img title="Jack Hanna" src="IMG/BB1pyP2Q_jack_hanna.jpg" alt="Jack Hanna"><figcaption><em>Jack Hanna.

The two conditions are caused by shrinkage in parts of the brain, and can lead to symptoms such as trouble communicating or changes in personality. </p><p>“After undergoing a battery of medical tests,” Williams was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia in 2023, according to a statement from her representatives. </p><p>“Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy’s ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy’s condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions,” the release stated. “Receiving a diagnosis has enabled Wendy to receive the medical care she requires.” </p><p>“I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD),” said Williams, who will turn 60 on July 18. </p><p>She said she hopes others with the same condition “benefit from my story,” adding, “I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive. Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.”</p><figure><img title="Wendy Williams" src="IMG/BB1pyJ44_wendy_williams.jpg" alt="Wendy Williams"><figcaption><em>Wendy Williams.

The HBO miniseries, directed by <strong>Ethan Hawke</strong>, revealed that while her husband was living with cancer, the <em>Three Faces of Eve</em> actress was also on her own health journey. </p><p>Woodward — the mother of three grown daughters — is living with her family in Connecticut. </p><p>“At this point, the best that can be done for Joanne is to keep her comfortable while waiting for the inevitable,” said an insider. “It’s a tribute to her courage and determination she has lived with this debilitating disease as long as she has.”</p></main>
