    <main><h1>How to Break Through Social Media Anxiety and Reclaim Your Life</h1><p>How much time do you spend on social media these days? Is it a few minutes or a few hours? Or do you avoid it at all costs?</p><p>No matter the answer, social media is a mixed bag.</p><p>While social media can be fun, it also comes with its drawbacks. It’s known to cause low self-esteem, stress, and anxiety. In this article, we will discuss several common effects of social media on mental health and how to manage them better.</p><h2>Social Media Causes Stress</h2><p>We’re often told not to compare our lives with others online, but it’s easier said than done. This is because we tend to compare our real lives with only what we see online — which is usually just the highlights of someone’s life. This constant comparison often leads to feelings of being less than others and stress to do more to compete globally.</p><h2>Counteracting Social Media Stress</h2><p>Reflecting on your values and challenging negative thoughts of self are great ways to instill self-worth and break the cycle of comparison and negative thoughts from frequent social media consumption. You may not be able to control everything around you, but you are always in control of how you respond to what you see and encounter on social media.</p><h2>FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)</h2><p>According to a 2021 study, FOMO is “a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.” This results in anxiety and depression, especially if you see someone else having fun and living it up while you’re stuck at home or work doing something boring.</p><h2>Preventing FOMO & Envy</h2><p>One way to prevent the fear of missing out is to recognize that the fear stems from a feeling that you don’t have enough and never will. But in reality, we’re all already in a position of abundance. We have everything we need to be happy.</p><p>Happiness is not something you get; it is something you already are. We often don’t realize that we already have everything we need to be happy and fulfilled. Making time for mindfulness practice is one of the best ways to maintain your perspective and mental health.</p><h2>Compulsive Use</h2><p>The fact that you’re always on, always available to react or respond can strain relationships and lead to social anxiety. You may feel anxious when you haven’t checked your phone in a few minutes. You can grow increasingly sensitive to and aware when no one has liked your status or when someone unfriends you.</p><p>If you’re anxious about social media, consider who’s really benefiting from your compulsive use. The tech industry is largely dependent upon addiction as a revenue model. Like many other addictive substances and activities (gambling comes to mind), the more time and money we spend through compulsive use, the more money we make.</p><figure><img title="Compulsive Use" src="IMG/BB1jg1dz_compulsive_use.jpg" alt="Compulsive Use"><figcaption><em>Compulsive Use.

When you notice yourself checking your phone when unnecessary, like at dinner or while driving, make a conscious effort to stop and put it down.</p><p>Consider getting your friends and family involved to help hold you accountable. Commit to unplug and be present during gatherings in person.</p><figure><img title="Preventing Compulsion" src="IMG/BB1iwQY9_preventing_compulsion.jpg" alt="Preventing Compulsion"><figcaption><em>Preventing Compulsion.

When you constantly see others updating their statuses, tweeting about what they are doing, or uploading pictures of their fabulous lives, it’s hard not to get caught up in competition for attention and validation.</p><p>It can be difficult to feel good about what you’ve accomplished when everyone else seems to be doing more and better than you are. You don’t always get to see what is really going on in other people’s lives; therefore, it’s important not to compare yourself.</p><h2>Avoiding Instant Gratification Dependency</h2><p>One way to overcome the need for instant gratification from social media is to set aside no-phone time and celebrate your accomplishments in person with friends and family. Focusing on your tangible relationships can help reduce the importance and draw of online input. Just like practicing self-worth, it’s important to remember your why and focus on being proud of yourself first.</p><h2>Overstimulation</h2><p>Social media gives us direct access to people all over the world. We can measure success with likes and shares or compare ourselves to competitors via social listening tools.</p><p>What does this mean for your mental health? When you’re constantly seeing how other businesses are doing better than you (or are seemingly enjoying a more exciting life), it’s easy to feel down about how your business is performing. And that only breeds more anxiety about what you’re doing wrong.</p><h2>Managing Overstimulation</h2><p>One way to stop the need for overstimulation of social media is to create a “No Social Media Day” once per week or every other week. During this day, you won’t log onto any social media sites and will instead focus on other things like work or personal projects. You can also try doing this every evening after work so that when you get home, all your social media accounts are closed until the next day!</p><figure><img title="Managing Overstimulation" src="IMG/BB1hGG50_managing_overstimulation.jpg" alt="Managing Overstimulation"><figcaption><em>Managing Overstimulation.
