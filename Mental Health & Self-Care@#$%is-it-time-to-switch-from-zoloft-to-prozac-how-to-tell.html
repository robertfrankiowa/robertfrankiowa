    <main><h1>Is It Time to Switch from Zoloft to Prozac? How to Tell</h1><h2>Zoloft (Sertraline) and Prozac (Fluoxetine): An Overview</h2><p>Let’s start with the basics: Zoloft and Prozac belong to a category of antidepressants called SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They do their job by targeting a neurotransmitter called serotonin, also known as the “happy hormone.” </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Because of their effectiveness, both Zoloft and Prozac are considered first-line treatments for treating depression, as well as certain anxiety disorders. In addition to having the official seal of approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, both meds are FDA-approved to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Their differences? Zoloft can be used to help people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and social anxiety disorder. Prozac, on the other hand, can be used as a treatment for bulimia nervosa. </p><figure><img title="Zoloft (Sertraline) and Prozac (Fluoxetine): An Overview" src="IMG/AA1nRKF1_zoloft_sertraline_and_prozac_fluoxetine_an_overview.jpg" alt="Zoloft (Sertraline) and Prozac (Fluoxetine): An Overview"><figcaption><em>Zoloft (Sertraline) and Prozac (Fluoxetine): An Overview.

This includes overlapping with certain common side effects, like: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Diarrhea and dyspepsia (indigestion) </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Nausea</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tremors</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sweating</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Decreased libido</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Abnormal ejaculation</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">There are several other potential side effects that could be cause by both medications, but some of these side effects may be more likely or more severe depending on whether you're taking Zoloft or Prozac.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">That said, you might switch from Zoloft to Prozac because: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The medication simply isn’t working for you. It may take several weeks or even a couple of months for your body to fully feel the effects of either medication, but even then, you still might not feel improvement after taking it. A 2015 study found that one-third of individuals with depression have treatment-resistant depression, or TRD, meaning their depression doesn’t necessarily improve with initial treatment.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">The side effects are too severe. From weight gain to difficulty sleeping, even a low dose of medication can have side effects. If they’re too intense or making you feel worse, you might want to consider switching. </p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">As always, if your side effects persist or you have concerns, reach out to your healthcare provider.</p><figure><img title="Common Reasons for Switching from Zoloft to Prozac" src="IMG/BB1l0NHe_common_reasons_for_switching_from_zoloft_to_prozac.jpg" alt="Common Reasons for Switching from Zoloft to Prozac"><figcaption><em>Common Reasons for Switching from Zoloft to Prozac.

This can happen to folks who decide to discontinue using their medication abruptly. In fact, roughly one in five people will experience withdrawal when they suddenly stop taking their antidepressants or change the dosage. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Just as it takes time for your brain to gradually adjust to a new medication, it takes time to adjust to <i>not</i> taking it. If you suddenly stop taking Zoloft, for example, it could result in discontinuation symptoms or even a relapse in your anxiety or depression. The same applies if you were to stop taking Prozac. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">For both Zoloft and Prozac, withdrawal symptoms can include: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Insomnia </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Anxiety </p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Mood changes</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Irritability</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Sweating</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Dizziness</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Confusion</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">How severe the symptoms are and how long they last are dependent upon the person. The bottom line? Quitting your meds without a game plan is never a good idea.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Below, we’ll outline the steps you should take instead. </p><figure><img title="Side Effects of Switching Zoloft to Prozac" src="IMG/BB1l0NGN_side_effects_of_switching_zoloft_to_prozac.jpg" alt="Side Effects of Switching Zoloft to Prozac"><figcaption><em>Side Effects of Switching Zoloft to Prozac. fizkes/istockphoto</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How to Switch Medications Safely</h2><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re considering switching medications, it’s important to do so responsibly and under the guidance of a healthcare provider.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Depending on the antidepressant, it can be safe to switch immediately (also called a “direct switch”) to a replacement. But when it comes to transitioning from Zoloft to Prozac, tapering is the recommended technique.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tapering involves slowly reducing your dosage of Zoloft until you stop taking it altogether. The process of tapering usually involves lowering your dosage every couple of days over the course of several weeks.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Tapering off your meds might last longer or be shorter based on what your provider recommends and your tolerability. Once the sertraline is no longer in your system, your provider will likely have you start taking Prozac at a dosage that works for your unique needs.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Cross-tapering is another technique where you gradually decrease the dosage of your current medication while simultaneously increasing the dosage of your new medication. </p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Switching antidepressants isn’t as complicated as it may seem. Still, it’s crucial to listen to your healthcare provider to lower your chances of experiencing</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">If you’re curious about switching from Prozac to a new medication — like escitalopram (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa or Cipramil)</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">or fluvoxamine (Luvox or Faverin) — our guide to antidepressant options can help you figure out which one is best for your needs.</p><figure><img title="How to Switch Medications Safely" src="IMG/BB1jWETp_how_to_switch_medications_safely.jpg" alt="How to Switch Medications Safely"><figcaption><em>How to Switch Medications Safely.

With the help of your healthcare provider — be it a primary care provider or a psychiatrist — you can come up with the best plan for your specific needs and mental health.</p><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">In the meantime, there are plenty of other ways to build up your mental health in addition to medication. This can include: </p><ul><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Opening up to a loved one. </b>Talking about your struggles with a loved one not only normalizes them but also lets others know you need support — and there’s nothing wrong with that. The people who care about you the most want to show up for you in the best way possible, and letting them in — even if it’s a little scary — is the first step.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Therapy. </b>Therapy is one of the most effective strategies for dealing with depression and anxiety. From cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to psychotherapy (or talk therapy), there’s a wide range of options to explore. If you don’t feel like meeting with someone in-person, online therapy is a super convenient alternative for connecting with a mental health professional.</p></li><li><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz"><b>Practicing self-care.</b> Self-care looks different to everyone, but it’s ultimately about prioritizing your needs, which includes your mental health. For some, self-care means getting enough rest, breaking a sweat at the gym or taking time to journal in the morning. For others, it’s scheduling post-work margaritas with friends. The best part? It’s up to you.</p></li></ul><p class="pstyle__P-sc-bf6a21b7-0 sc-f9686baa-1 fGEIGZ jjmOUz">Still feeling stuck?
