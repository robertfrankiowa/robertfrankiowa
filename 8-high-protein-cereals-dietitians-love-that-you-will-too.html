    <main><h1>8 High Protein Cereals Dietitians Love (That You Will, Too)</h1><h2>Catalina Crunch</h2><p>Clevenger calls Catalina Crunch the clear winner when it comes to high-protein cereal. “Per serving, it has zero grams of added sugar, 9 grams of fiber, 11 grams of protein, and 5 grams of net carbs making it suitable for those following a keto diet as well,” she says.</p><figure><img title="Catalina Crunch" src="IMG/BB1j7Jp6_catalina_crunch.jpg" alt="Catalina Crunch"><figcaption><em>Catalina Crunch.

All flavors contain 12 to 14 grams of protein and no added sugar.</p><p>Clevenger appreciates that this cereal brand has 4 to 5 grams of net carbs per serving and is gluten and grain-free. “Although Magic Spoon is on the pricier side, there’s a reason why. It uses a milk protein blend instead of a pea protein, it uses monk fruit and allulose instead of stevia and erythritol, and it has zero grams of added sugar,” says Clevenger. </p><p>Since this cereal doesn’t have a ton of fiber, she suggests topping your portion with some berries to get more fiber.</p><h2>Nature's Path</h2><p>Nature's Path blueberry-cinnamon cereal medley contains a blend of organic whole grain flakes, puffed Kamut wheat, and flax seeds with freeze-dried blueberries and cinnamon.</p><p>Each serving boasts 16 grams of fiber (even more if you add fresh blueberries to your bowl, which you definitely should) and 9 grams of protein. FYI: This product does contain 9 grams of added sugar, so slightly higher on the sugar count. To cut the sugar content, consider mixing it with a preferred unsweetened or low-sugar cereal of your choice.</p><h2>Wonderworks Peanut Butter</h2><p>Wonderworks' PB cereal really packs on the protein.</p><p>“This cereal has a few different protein blends which help boost its protein to 17 grams per serving,” says Clevenger, adding that it has zero grams of added sugar and 3 grams of fiber. “If you are sensitive to erythritol or inulin, you might want to skip this brand as both of those are ingredients." </p><figure><img title="Wonderworks Peanut Butter" src="IMG/BB1j7UTI_wonderworks_peanut_butter.jpg" alt="Wonderworks Peanut Butter"><figcaption><em>Wonderworks Peanut Butter.

Yawitz likes that Wholesome Provisions has 15 grams of protein, with 3 grams of fiber and no added sugar; the total sugar content is just 1 gram. </p><p>“Serve it with high-protein milk (like Fairlife) to get even more protein and some extra vitamins and minerals,” she says. For an antioxidant boost, add some berries or sliced bananas on top.</p><h2>Seven Sundays</h2><p>Seven Sundays is billed as the first of its kind made with upcycled oats and simple ingredients (you know, the ones you can pronounce), all flavors are made with no refined sugars, GMOs, glyphosate, artificial, or “natural” flavors. Flavors run the gamut from Golden Apple Oat and Maple Cinnamon (our go-to) to Chocolate Sea Salt and Super Fruity, with only 1 to 7 grams of added sugars per serving depending on the flavor.</p><figure><img title="Seven Sundays" src="IMG/BB1j7ENX_seven_sundays.jpg" alt="Seven Sundays"><figcaption><em>Seven Sundays.

A tasty mixture of non-GMO steel cut oats, hulled barley and brown rice, we love that this hot cereal has no added sugar, and 5 grams each of protein and fiber per serving. Add a tablespoon or two of almond butter or peanut butter, or your favorite protein powder to thicken it up, to give your breakfast bowl a protein lift.</p><figure><img title="Great River Milling Highland Medley Hot Cereal" src="IMG/BB1j7Jpl_great_river_milling_highland_medley_hot_cereal.jpg" alt="Great River Milling Highland Medley Hot Cereal"><figcaption><em>Great River Milling Highland Medley Hot Cereal. Great River Milling</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Arrowhead Mills Puffed Kamut and Your Favorite Protein Shake</h2><p>Here’s an idea from Clevenger: Choose a cereal like Arrowhead Mills'puffed Kamut, which has only one ingredient, and then use a ready-to-drink protein shake or protein powder with milk instead of just milk as your base to make it high protein (total protein count will depend on what type of protein shake you use as your 'milk'). For added fiber, she suggests adding nuts, berries, and/or chia seeds for toppings.</p></main>
