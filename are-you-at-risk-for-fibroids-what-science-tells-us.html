Provided by Flow Space</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve experienced symptoms like heavier-than-usual bleeding that you may have later figured out were uterine fibroids, a type of benign tumor, you’re definitely not alone. You’d be among the 20 to 80 percent of women will develop fibroids by the time they reach age 50. According to data from The Department of Health and Human Resources, fibroids are most common in women in their forties and early fifties. As you approach menopause, this is the time you’re most at risk for fibroids. </p><p>But what does research say about why this age group has the highest risk, and how they can recognize the signs? According to medical experts, the underlying reason could be linked to hormone exposure. </p><p>"The exact reasons for development of fibroids are not well-known; much of it is genetic," Dr. Marci Peralto, board-certified OB/GYN at Pediatrix Medical Group, tells Flow Space. "These benign tumors are made from uterine muscle that contains extra estrogen and progesterone receptors. So, anything that increases the amount of hormone exposure can increase the risk for fibroids."</p><p>For example, Dr. Peralto explains that early onset of periods and obesity can contribute to uterine fibroids due to higher levels of circulating estrogen in their bodies. To understand what causes uterine fibroids, Dr. Peralto says it's important to have a solid understanding of what uterine fibroids are, the symptoms of fibroids, and how they can be treated. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are uterine fibroids? </h2><p>Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas, are basically clumps of muscle and tissue that pop up in or on your uterus wall. They’re mostly harmless to your health, and are the most common type of noncancerous tumor among women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). </p><p>However, the symptoms for uterine fibroids are no picnic. They can really vary, but most individuals who have them experience pain and super heavy, irregular bleeding. Others might not notice any symptoms at all and have no clue they even have fibroids.</p><p>"Changes in periods and infertility are primarily affected by fibroids that are located within the wall or lining of the uterus, changing the shape of the uterine cavity," Dr. Peralto says. "Fibroids are not screened for in women without symptoms. However, for women experiencing one or more of the symptoms, the primary diagnostic tool is pelvic ultrasound. This is minimally invasive, quick and relatively inexpensive. Pelvic MRI can also be useful in pre-surgery planning but is not used for screening."</p><p>There are racial health disparities involving uterine fibroids: Black women around the world experience higher rates of uterine fibroids compared to Caucasian, Asian and Hispanic women. Dr. Peralto says there is no definitive medical reason for this increased risk, but it is likely multifactorial; one factor that might exacerbate fibroid growth is the level of stress Black women experience. In addition, Black women also develop fibroids earlier in life and tend to experience larger and more numerous fibroids that cause more severe symptoms. </p><p>"It is also well known that fibroid growth is hormonally stimulated and can run in families, suggesting a genetic component," Dr. Peralto says. "Some studies have shown that Black women have higher rates of a certain enzyme (aromatase) within the uterine muscle, which would increase the amount of estrogen that the uterus is exposed to. And since fibroid growth is bolstered by estrogen, this is one theory as to the increased prevalence of fibroids in Black women."</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the health risk factors for fibroids?</h2><p>"Factors associated with an increased risk for fibroids include early age at menarche (under 10 years old), increasing age, and environmental factors such as exposure to endocrine disruptors," says Dr. Janet Choi, a double board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and the Chief Medical Officer of Progyny, a data-driven model dedicated to women's health. Dr. Choi tells Flow Space that in addition, a diet high in meat compared to one focused on plants, fruits, and vegetables can also contribute to a higher risk of fibroids, in addition to alcohol consumption and low vitamin D levels. </p><p>"There are studies that suggest high physical activity may be associated with a lower risk of fibroid development," Dr. Choi says. "Additionally, a healthy diet and minimal to no alcohol consumption also play crucial roles."</p><p>While diet plays a significant role in the risk factors for developing uterine fibroids, Dr. Peralto says weight reduction in overweight and obese women can actually decrease fibroid growth and significantly improve abnormal periods, especially in women at increased risk. "Weight loss can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as a healthy diet and physical activity," Dr. Peralto says. "Most, if not all, of the risk is genetically predetermined, but there are reports of studies showing increased risk of fibroids in women who consume high levels of soy, red meat, alcohol, and processed sugar. Reduction of these things in women’s diets can be helpful for a variety of reasons and possibly decrease the risk for developing fibroids."</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there effective preventative measures that women can take to reduce risk?</h2><p>Although there are no guaranteed ways to prevent uterine fibroids, some lifestyle choices and medical approaches may help reduce the risk or manage the severity of symptoms. </p><p>"There are a wide variety of hormonal and surgical treatments for symptomatic fibroids," Dr. Peralto says. One top-line treatment might be hormonal birth control to manage both hormones and heavy bleeding. "But the only definitive treatment is hysterectomy, which can often be achieved with a minimally invasive or robotic approach," says Dr. Peralto. </p><p>However, Dr. Peralto says a hysterectomy is major pelvic surgery that poses its own risks and a significant recovery time. Continued exploration of minimally invasive or nonsurgical treatment techniques such as radiofrequency or ultrasound ablation are very promising for treatment of fibroids, especially in women who would like to retain the ability to bear children, she says. In addition, mifepristone, the drug used to terminate a pregnancy, has been shown to be an effective treatment for fibroids. In fact, a 2021 study found that mifepristone significantly reduced fibroid volume and improved patients' symptoms.</p><p>According to Dr. Choi, current acceptable interventions depend on patient history and family-building desires.  "For symptomatic fibroids, surgery (such as myomectomy, a procedure that removes fibroids from the uterine walls) is common. GnRH agonist medications (such as Lupron) provide temporary relief, but are not indicated for fertility patients, as fibroids regrow after stopping the medication," Dr. Choi says. "For those not interested in fertility, newer procedures like uterine artery embolization or high-intensity focused ultrasound can be considered."</p><p>These expansions in treatment options are promising. But ultimately, more studies are needed to understand how to prevent fibroid development and growth, Dr. Choi adds. </p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
