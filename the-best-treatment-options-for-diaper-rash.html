    <main><h1>The Best Treatment Options for Diaper Rash</h1><p>Oh no, while changing your baby's diaper, you discover he or she has an awful rash. Diaper rash grows in warm, moist places. It appears when the skin becomes red and inflamed around the child’s bum and genital area. Sometimes it can spread up the legs and to the stomach. Diaper rash may be more common due to antibiotics, diapers being too tight, irritated skin, the introduction of new foods, and sensitive skin. Fortunately, it is not a serious medical condition, and there are home remedies and creams that can be used to treat it. Let's take a look at some of the best treatment options for diaper rash as well as things you can do to avoid it.</p><h2>1. Change Diapers Often</h2><p>It is best to change diapers often. A small amount of trapped moisture or solids may aggravate the skin and cause a rash. If the baby has a rash, you may need to wake up during the night to change diapers to prevent the rash from getting worse. Furthermore, when changing each diaper, use warm water to rinse your baby’s bum. Do this without rubbing with a soft cloth, and then pat dry.</p><h2>2. Use Disposable Diapers</h2><p>For babies prone to diaper rash, it is best to use a diaper containing an absorbent gel. This is because it draws the wetness away from the skin.</p><h2>3.

Diaper Free</h2><p>If your baby has an acute diaper rash, you should let your baby go diaper-free for a couple of hours daily. First, start with about 15 minutes and work your way up. During nap time, it is a good idea. To avoid any mess, consider putting down a large towel or waterproof sheet. When the baby is awake, try diaper-free during playtime, tummy time, and before and after bath time.</p><h2>6. Cloth Diapers</h2><p>Always check the manufacturer’s instructions on how to clean cloth diapers properly. Make sure to use the correct amount of detergent. You may want to consider the type of cleaning product that you are using, as baby could be sensitive to the ingredients used in them. Use fragrance-free detergents, and give cloth nappies an extra rise cycle.</p><figure><img title="6. Cloth Diapers" src="IMG/BB1p3CBw_6_cloth_diapers.jpg" alt="6. Cloth Diapers"><figcaption><em>6.

Babies grow fast, and if wearing the wrong size, it can cause irritation. Diapers that are too small might hold in too much moisture and cause rash growth. On the other hand, diapers that are too big can cause friction when they rub on the skin, making the rash worse. It is important to get the right size to avoid chafing. </p><h2>8. Oatmeal Bath</h2><p>A research study found that colloidal oatmeal may ease inflammation in skin conditions and reduce the itching and pain of diaper rash. Furthermore, oatmeal baths can also benefit those who suffer from eczema. Oatmeal bath treatments are available online and at most drug stores. However, if you don’t have colloidal oatmeal on hand and you have some oats in the pantry, just blend them up into a fine powder and add a spoonful or two to the baby’s warm bath water. Then soak for 10-15 minutes.</p><h2>9. Wet Wipes</h2><p>You might have bought a different brand of wet wipes that your baby could be sensitive to. Consider switching to a fragrance-free wipe, like Pampers Aqua Pure Baby Wipes, or try a water-based wipe, such as Waterwipes. These wipes are 99% water and less irritating. Waterwipes are available at Target, Walmart, and Amazon.</p><h2>10. Think about Avoiding Any New Foods</h2><p>When introducing new foods, it should be done in small quantities. Some foods, such as oranges, strawberries, lemons, limes, and tomatoes, can cause stools and urine to become acidic. Keep in mind other foods that contain tomatoes, like pasta sauces and ketchup. These foods should be avoided until the diaper rash has cleared up.</p><figure><img title="10.
