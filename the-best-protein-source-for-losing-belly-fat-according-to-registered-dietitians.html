However, experts share that eating a well-balanced diet is a far better tactic, and your belly-fat-trimming playbook should include protein. In fact, 10 to 35 percent of your daily calories should come from proteins, according to the Cleveland Clinic. </p><p>Protein promotes a "sense of fullness, helping build muscle and increasing our metabolic rate resulting in burning excess fat over time," says <strong>Anthony DiMarino, RD</strong>, a registered dietitian from Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition.</p><p>While every body is beautiful, losing belly fat has significant health benefits.</p><p>"Having too much belly fat can put you at risk for chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, liver disease and kidney disease," DiMarino says. "When left unchecked, too much belly may put you at risk for heart disease and some cancers as well."</p><p>Protein consumption is a critical tool for reducing belly fat. But there are so many types of protein, from steak to tofu and chicken in between. What's the best protein if you're trying to lose belly fat? A pair of registered dietitians weigh in.</p><h2>Why Is Protein Important for Losing Belly Fat?</h2><p>Eating protein has a ton of benefits, including losing belly fat. </p><p>"Protein has a stronger satiety, or appetite-reducing effect, compared with fat or carbohydrates," says <strong>Michelle Milgrim</strong><strong>, MS, RD, CDN, CLC</strong>, the program director of employee wellness at Northwell Health. “Protein is known to stimulate a greater release of the hunger-suppressing hormones, PYY and GLP-1.”</p><p>A small study of 12 women from 2006 linked protein intake to satiety.</p><p>Milgrim adds that protein can affect the metabolism. A 2020 review noted that consuming protein heightens a person's energy expenditure. Protein has a much higher diet-inducted thermogenesis (DIT), or post-meal heat production within the body associated with a body's resting metabolic rate, than fat or carbohydrates.</p><p>That's not all. A 2022 study indicated that consuming more protein could help a person make healthier food choices and lower lean body mass, which is often linked with weight loss. </p><h2>What Is the Best Protein Source for Losing Belly Fat?</h2><p>Lean animal meat—like chicken, turkey, fish and shellfish.</p><p>"These lean meats provide ample protein that is absorbed and used easily by our bodies," DiMarino says. "Plus, these meats offer essential vitamins and minerals required for overall health."</p><p>Milgrim agrees that the best protein sources are complete ones. What qualifies as a "complete protein"? Milgrim explains that a complete protein "contains all nine essential amino acids needed by the body."</p><p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, amino acids refer to compounds the body needs to make proteins. People require 20 of these amino acids, but 11 occur naturally. </p><p>"Complete proteins are mostly found in animal foods like eggs, poultry, meat, fish and dairy," Milgrim explains.</p><h2>What Proteins Can Vegetarians Consume To Lose Belly Fat?</h2><p>Vegetarians and vegans can still consume protein as part of an effort to lose body fat. For starters, some plant-based foods offer complete proteins, like whole sources of soy, such as tofu, Milgrim explains. </p><p>It's also possible to combine protein sources.</p><p>"Eating a variety of incomplete sources over the day like nuts, seeds, beans, whole grains and vegetables will create complete proteins in the body," Milgrim says. "But because these foods are less protein-dense, you need to consume more to get the same total protein from a smaller amount of a complete protein source."</p><h2>How Much Protein Should Someone Eat Daily for Belly Fat Loss?</h2><p>Between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, Milgrim says.</p><p>"Studies have found that higher protein diets containing between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilograms of body weight can support greater satiety, weight loss and muscle preservation," she explains. </p><p>According to research published in 2015, people consuming this amount of protein daily (with meals containing about 25 to 30 grams) saw appetite and weight management improve. </p><p>"Aiming for about 25 to 30 grams of protein at each meal and incorporating high protein snacks throughout the day can help you achieve a higher protein diet," Milgrim says. </p><p>Bonus: "Such diets have also been found to improve cardiometabolic risk factors as well," Milgrim explains.</p><p>That said, you likely don't need to load up on extra protein.</p><p>"Most Americans typically consume more than the recommended amount of protein each day with lunch and dinners packing in at least 25 grams of protein," Milgrim says.</p><h2>Tips for Consuming Protein When Trying To Lose Belly Fat</h2><p>Most people get enough protein. However, Milgrim says she notices people's breakfasts are the most likely to fall below the 25-gram benchmark that some research shows can aid in weight management.</p><p>"Routinely incorporating lean protein sources at breakfast like eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, chicken sausage, peanut butter, almonds and black beans can support a higher protein diet," Milgrim says. </p><p>Then, throughout the day, ensure you're adding some protein to meals and snacks.</p><p>"Proteins at a meal would include animal meats, beans and plant-based alternatives," says DiMarino. "Snack-based proteins could include string cheese, yogurt, nuts or even a protein shake."</p><p>Again, not all of these fall under animal protein, but combined, they ensure your body is getting the necessary amino acids.</p><h2>Other Ways To Lose Belly Fat</h2><h3>1. Eat a well-balanced diet</h3><p>Protein is an essential building block of any diet, especially if you want to lose belly fat. However, the foundation of a nutritious diet is broader.</p><p>"Weight loss cannot only be achieved with eating more protein," DiMarino says. "One must eat a well-balanced meal plan of lean proteins, low-fat dairy, vegetables and fruits. It is critical to stay hydrated with low-calorie beverages."</p><p>DiMarino also suggests minimizing the intake of certain foods and beverages, like sugar-sweetened drinks, alcohol and sweets.</p><h3>2. Movement</h3><p>Diet will only take you so far when trying to lose belly fat.</p><p>"Incorporating exercise and increasing overall daily movement can support weight loss and management," Milgrim says. "Look for ways to build up to 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise along with two days of muscle-strengthening exercise weekly."</p><p>Go slow—you don't have to go from no weekly exercise to 150 minutes right away. You also don't have to get all of your daily movement in at once.</p><p>"Build in time throughout the day in small increments," Milgrim says. "This can include 10 minutes of brisk walking after a meal, 15 minutes of dancing along to your favorite Zumba video during your lunch break, push-ups during television commercials, walking the field perimeter during your child’s game, standing calf raises on line at checkout and more."</p><p>The biggest key? </p><p>"[Finding] enjoyable ways to get more movement throughout the day is key to getting in your 150 minutes," Milgrim says.</p><h3>3. Focus on sleep and stress</h3><p>These two critical factors are often overlooked in today's on-the-go, always-on society. DiMarino says it's important to buck the idea that running on empty is normal—especially when managing belly fat.</p><p>"Lack of quality sleep or stress control can increase our belly fat," he says. "Therefore, do your best to manage your sleep and stress."</p><p>Losing belly fat can feel complicated, and it's highly personal. You don't have to go it alone.</p><p>"Consult your physician and meet with a dietitian," DiMarino recommends. "We can assess your current situation and provide you with feedback and guidance [for] sustainable results."</p></main>
