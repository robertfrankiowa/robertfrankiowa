Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to losing weight—especially belly fat, which can be the hardest to lose—many people focus on what <em>not</em> to eat. Raiding the pantry and throwing away all the “junk,” vowing to not snack during the day or evening, swearing off sugar…Can you relate to any of this? </p><p>Instead of focusing on what not to eat, registered dietitians encourage people who are trying to lose weight to adopt another mindset, focusing on all the nutrient-rich foods that work in your favor to fill up on. Guess what—that includes snacks! PSA: You don’t have to cut snacktime out of your life if you want to get rid of belly fat. In fact, there’s one snack in particular that registered dietitians say can help. </p><h2>Common Diet Mistakes People Make When They’re Trying to Lose Weight </h2><p><strong>Caroline Thomason, RD, CES, </strong>a registered dietitian based in Washington DC, says that one common mistake she sees people who are trying to lose weight make is drastically cutting calories. “Most people have it in their mind that they need to keep calories to 1,200 or lower to see weight loss results. While that may be true for some, most people cannot maintain an extreme calorie deficit for long,” she explains. </p><p>Thomason adds that sticking to a low-calorie diet is mentally and physically challenging, and might not even be necessary for the majority of people. “If you’re more likely to give up out of exhaustion and frustration in a few weeks, it’s probably not the right weight loss plan for you,” she says. </p><p><strong>Kelsey Costa, MS, RDN,</strong> a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant for the E-Health Project, says she sees this too. She shares that people who are trying to get rid of belly fat often focus on low-calorie processed foods when it would be more effective to choose nutrient-rich options.</p><p>Costa also says that many people who are trying to lose weight don’t get enough protein and fiber. “Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that protein intake above the recommended dietary allowance can reduce overall body weight and improve body composition by lowering fat mass and maintaining lean muscle mass in both calorie-restricted and normal-calorie diets,” she adds. She explains that a high-protein diet can help with weight loss by improving appetite control, preserving lean muscle mass during calorie restriction and slightly increasing energy expenditure (burning more calories during digestion as compared to carbohydrates and fat).</p><p>As for fiber, Costa says that this nutrient is important (along with other essential vitamins and minerals) to keep the gut microbiome healthy and to reduce systemic inflammation. This, she explains, helps support efficient fat metabolism, making it easier to lose weight. </p><p>Thomason also says that it’s crucial to prioritize protein and fiber. “These are two inherently satiating nutrients, meaning that they keep you full for longer and might even prevent overeating later,” she explains.</p><h2>The Best Snack for Getting Rid of Belly Fat</h2><p>With all of this in mind, what is the best snack for getting rid of belly fat? Thomason recommends choosing a snack that has a balance of protein and a high-fiber carbohydrate. “One example of a snack like this would be a <strong>packet of tuna or chicken and whole-grain crackers</strong>,” she says.  </p><p>Thomason explains that the protein in the chicken or tuna will help you feel full faster than if eating a nutrient-void snack low in protein while the carbohydrates in the whole-grain crackers provide energy without resulting in a crash later, due to their fiber content. </p><p>Craving something sweet instead? Costa recommends reaching for a handful of berries. “Berries—including but not limited to strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries—are true 'superfoods', exceedingly rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, antioxidants and other beneficial plant compounds with anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory properties,” she says.  </p><p>Remember how the dietitians emphasized prioritizing fiber? Berries are full of the nutrient. “Dietary fiber, a key component found abundantly in berries, may play a crucial role in enhancing weight loss and improving diet adherence among adults battling overweight or obesity on calorie-restricted diets,” Costa says. She adds that fiber supports the digestive system and promotes a healthy gut microbiome, which makes losing weight easier. </p><p>It bears repeating that you don’t have to get rid of snacktime if you want to lose weight. The key is choosing a nutrient-rich snack that will work in your favor. Now you have two snack ideas to keep in mind, depending on if you’re in the mood for something savory or sweet. Happy snacking! </p></main>
