Provided by Health</em></figcaption></figure><strong>Medically reviewed by Brigid Dwyer, MD</strong><p>An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging in the wall of an artery or vein that fills with blood. Arteries are blood vessels that send oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Aneurysms can happen in any artery or vein throughout the body, including the brain, heart, intestines, abdomen, and occur when part of the vessel wall is thinned or weakened. Most small aneurysms don’t cause any symptoms until they are large, start leaking blood, or ruptures.</p><p>Aneurysms can happen at any age but are more common during the ages of 30 to 60. Symptoms depend on where it occurs in the body and how large the aneurysm is. Some common symptoms include sudden headache, pain in the abdomen, neck or chest, blurry vision, skin discoloration, among many others.</p><p>Most common aneurysms are typically the size of a small berry. If an aneurysm bursts, symptoms can happen suddenly and require immediate medical attention. </p><h2>Aneurysm Symptoms</h2><p>Aneurysm symptoms are based on location and whether the aneurysm is large or has ruptured. Common symptoms you can experience during a aneurysm include:</p><ul><li>Sudden headache</li><li>Abdomen or back pain</li><li>Discoloration of the lower extremities</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Blurry vision</li><li>Confusion</li></ul><p>Types of aneurysms are defined by their location. Symptoms will vary on whether the aneurysm has burst, or if it is large and pressing up against other parts of your body.</p><h3>Cerebral Aneurysm Symptoms</h3><p>Cerebral aneurysms occurs in arteries in the brain. They can affect any area of the brain, but they usually form in arteries at the base of the skull. If a cerebral aneurysm becomes large enough it can press up against brain tissue. Pressure on brain nerves caused by a large aneurysm can cause the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>Pain behind the eyes</li><li>Paralysis on one side of the face</li><li>Pupil dilation</li><li>Drooping eyelids (ptosis)</li><li>Double vision or blurry vision</li></ul><p>More severe symptoms can occur if an aneurysm in the brain bursts or leaks blood. This is known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The brain damage caused by this type of bleeding is known as a stroke. The primary symptoms of a burst or leaking cerebral aneurysm include: </p><ul><li>A sudden headache that can last hours or days </li><li>Double vision</li><li>Nausea and/or vomiting</li><li>Neck stiffness</li><li>Light sensitivity</li><li>Seizures</li><li>Loss of consciousness or coma</li><li>Weakness or paralysis of arms or legs</li><li>In some cases, death</li></ul><h3>Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms</h3><p>An aortic aneurysm happens in the aorta, the main artery that sends blood away from your heart to the rest of your body. Aortic aneurysms are the most common type of aneurysms.</p><p>An aneurysm that happens in the chest is known as a thoracic aneurysm, while one that happens below the chest is known as an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysms include: </p><ul><li>Sudden pain in the chest or upper back</li><li>Trouble breathing or swallowing</li><li>Shortness of breath</li></ul><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common than thoracic aneurysm. Symptoms of abdominal aneurysms include: </p><ul><li>Throbbing pain in the back or side</li><li>Pain in the groin</li><li>Pain buttocks or legs</li><li>Discoloration of lower extremities</li></ul><h3>Popliteal Artery Aneurysm Symptoms</h3><p>This type of aneurysm happens in the popliteal artery, which is one of the major arteries of the leg and is located behind your knee. Most popliteal artery aneurysms are asymptomatic.</p><p>Symptoms usually present themselves when the aneurysm is enlarged and puts pressure on structures in the leg including nerves and veins. Common popliteal artery aneurysm symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Leg pain</li><li>Paresthesia (the feeling of “pins and needles” on your skin)</li><li>Muscle weakness</li><li>Thrombosis (blood clots)</li><li>Pulsating mass in the back of your knee</li></ul><p>This type of aneurysm happens in the splenic artery, the artery that provides major blood flow into the spleen. Splenic artery aneurysms represent 60 to 70% of aneurysm cases in the visceral arteries, which are the arteries that provide blood to parts of the body like the kidneys, spleen, livers, and intestines.</p><p>Symptoms of a splenic artery aneurysm are:</p><ul><li>Abdominal pain that in some cases radiates up to the left shoulder</li><li>Internal hemorrhage (internal bleeding) </li><li>Hematemesis (vomiting blood)</li></ul><h2>Aneurysm Symptoms in Men/Women</h2><p>There are no specific differences in aneurysm symptoms between men and women. However, there are differences in the type of aneurysms that affect men and women. </p><p>Cerebral aneurysms are more common in women than in men. According to a 2022 review published by the American Heart Association, showed that women have a 1.4 times higher risk of having a brain aneurysm rupture than men. The study, which analyzed the data from 9940 patients, showed that on average, women had larger sized brain aneurysms, increasing the likelihood of bursting.</p><p>While cerebral aneurysms are more common in women, abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men. A 2020 study found that the rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture was higher in men (68%) versus women (32%). This higher rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture was correlated with higher rates of smoking in men. </p><p>It is important to note that data is limited and more studies need to be done to determine the cause of these sex-based differences.</p><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Aneurysm symptoms happen quickly soon after becoming large or bursting. A ruptured aneurysm can cause serious health concerns and, if not treated quickly, can be life-threatening.</p><p>If you experience a sudden and very painful headache you should seek immediate medical attention. Some symptoms to keep a lookout for in combination of a sudden and severe headache include: </p><ul><li>Double vision</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Stiff neck</li><li>Sensitivity to light</li></ul><p>It is important to note that not all aneurysms develop into large aneurysms that burst. Usually, small aneurysms are seen in the brain or the aorta during diagnostic testing for other medical conditions. Screenings for aneurysms are recommended for individuals over the ages of 65, those who have a family history of aneurysms or high blood pressure, and people who have a history of smoking.</p><p>If your healthcare provider finds a small aneurysm in your body during a screening, they can determine if preventive measures like surgery or prescribing some blood thinning medicine are needed.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Aneurysms are abnormal bulges on artery walls that fill up with blood and can burst if they become large enough. While most small aneurysms do not cause any symptoms, large aneurysms and ruptured aneurysms can cause a series of health concerns.</p><p>Symptoms depend on where the aneurysm is in your body. Aneurysms can cause many symptoms, including cause a sudden and severe headache, blurry vision, pain in the chest and abdomen, and seizures. In some cases, a burst aneurysm can cause a coma or death.</p><p>Symptoms usually happen suddenly, therefore it is essential that you reach out to your healthcare provider immediately if you experience a combination of any of these symptoms. Screening for aneurysms for people over the age of 65 and those who have a family history of aneurysms is recommended to help catch aneurysms early and potentially take preventive measures, if needed.</p></main>
