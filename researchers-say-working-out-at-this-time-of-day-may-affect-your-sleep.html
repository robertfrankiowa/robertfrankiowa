    <main><h1>Researchers Say Working Out at This Time of Day May Affect Your Sleep</h1><p> [table-of-contents] stripped </p><p>The benefits of working out are vast (walking can lower your risk of type 2 diabetes and early death, and generally boosts heart health). But with busy schedules and only 24 hours in a day it can be difficult to find the time. By nighttime, if you haven’t gotten your steps in, working out before bed may feel like the only option. But could it affect your sleep; and is it better than forgoing exercise altogether?</p><figure><img title="Klaus Vedfelt - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1kHln4_can_working_out_before_bed_affect_your_sleep.jpg" alt="Can Working Out Before Bed Affect Your Sleep?"><figcaption><em>Working out before bed may affect sleep, but avoiding rigorous exercise at night may help.

Ahead, experts explain if it’s a good idea to work out before bed, the best type of exercise to do at night, and more. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Does exercising before bed impact sleep?</h2><p>It’s not a problem for everyone, but for many, vigorous exercise before bed can give them a burst of energy, raise their body temperature, disrupt their wind down, and make it harder to fall asleep, says Aric Prather, Ph.D., sleep expert and co-developer of Headspace’s Finding Your Best Sleep program.</p><p>If you are engaging in a high-intensity workout, your body experiences an increase in metabolic rate, adrenaline, blood pressure, and heart rate, and it takes time for your body to return to its normal and relaxed state, says Nicole Avena, M.D., research neuroscientist, and an expert in nutrition and diet, brain health, and wellness. “This means if you were to exercise before you go to sleep, you run the chance of not allowing your body enough time to wind down (including cool down).” If your body isn’t in its relaxed state before bed, it’s more difficult to fall and stay asleep, she explains.</p><p>For many people, exercising before bed can increase body temperature too much, notes Angela Holliday-Bell, M.D., board-certified physician, certified sleep specialist, and host of The Art of Sleep. “And since a one to two-degree drop in body temp is needed in order to transition to and maintain sleep, exercising before bed can hinder your ability to fall asleep.” Endorphins that are often released due to exercise can also be stimulating and make it more difficult to fall asleep, she adds. </p><h2 class="body-h2">What type of exercise is best before bed?</h2><p>If you’re going to exercise before bed, it’s best to engage in low-intensity exercises, says Dr. Avena. “Activities like yoga or going on an evening walk can help to stretch and relax your muscles without spiking your adrenaline.” These movements can improve your sleep by allowing your mind and body to relax while reducing stress, adds Dr. Avena.</p><p>Dr. Holliday-Bell agrees that exercises requiring less exertion like yoga or gentle stretching are ideal before bed. “It’s best to avoid exercises that are too strenuous as they can cause the body temperature to be elevated too long, making it difficult to fall asleep,” she explains. </p><h2 class="body-h2">What is the best time of day for exercise?</h2><p>The best time of day for exercise is the time of the day you can fit it in, says Prather. However, evidence suggests that exercising earlier in the day can benefit sleep, including increasing deep sleep, he notes.</p><p>Research even notes that the morning is the best time of day for exercise, says Dr. Avena. One study found that people who worked out in the morning slept longer, experienced deeper sleep cycles, and spent 75% more time in the most reparative stages of slumber (both mind and body) than those who exercised at later times in the day. </p><p>Research also suggests that people who exercise earlier in the day find it easier to stay focused and tend to make healthier food choices, says Dr. Avena. “Starting your day with a workout can set a positive tone, making you more aware of your dietary choices throughout the day,” she explains. </p><p>There’s also the thought that working out in the a.m. boosts metabolism, and research supports this, too. One recent study found that early morning activity—between 7 and 9 a.m.—could help with weight loss. Another study suggests that late-morning exercise could be more effective than late evening exercise in terms of boosting the metabolism and burning fat.</p><p>For Dr. Avena, “being active in the morning improves my ability to concentrate, focus, and retain information throughout my workday.” Studies even show that exercise may help decrease overall stress levels and improve well-being, she notes.</p><h2 class="body-h2">How does exercise benefit sleep?</h2><p>It’s likely that exercise benefits sleep for several reasons, says Prather. First, sleep helps relieve stress. “Stress is one of the biggest reasons why so many have chronic sleep problems, and getting regular exercise has been shown to be a reliable stress-buster,” says Prather. Second, regular exercise helps regulate our circadian rhythm—our internal clock. “This stability makes [the] time we wake up and the time we get sleepy at night reliable,” Prather explains. Third, there is some evidence to suggest exercise can improve slow-wave sleep, which is our deepest sleep and the aspect of sleep most often linked to restoration, he adds.</p><p>Exercise in general may cut down the time it takes for someone to fall asleep while also reducing the number of times they wake up in the middle of the night, says Dr. Avena. “Overall, it results in a deeper and more restful night’s sleep if you give your body enough time to properly cool down before bed,” Dr. Avena says. The effect exercise has on stress reduction and overall mental wellbeing can play a big role in benefiting quality sleep, she adds.</p><h2 class="body-h2">What else can help you sleep better?</h2><p>Regular exercise is one aspect of good sleep hygiene, but it’s not the only one, says Prather. “Be sure to create a supportive wind down prior to bed and disconnect from work and other things that keep your mind buzzing at least an hour before you want to get to sleep,” Prather says. Avoiding alcohol a couple of hours before bed and cutting off your caffeine consumption by the early afternoon will also help you get better sleep, Prather advises. </p><p>Keeping a consistent schedule is also key when it comes to getting good sleep, meaning try waking up and going to sleep around the same time each night, says Dr. Holliday-Bell. “Having a consistent and non-stimulating bedtime routine can help protect against stress and make it easier to fall asleep. Also, sleeping in a bedroom space that is dark, quiet, cool, and clutter-free can lead to better sleep as well,” Dr. Holliday-Bell notes. Getting natural light exposure first thing in the mornings also helps to reinforce your circadian rhythm making it easier to wake up and fall asleep, she adds.</p><p>If you find yourself frequently waking up in the middle of the night or restless before bed, try switching to low-impact or low-intensity exercise before bed. Or, move your high-intensity workouts earlier in the day, says Dr. Avena.</p><p>Although research shows that working out before bed may disrupt your sleep schedule, any exercise is better than no exercise, says Dr. Holliday-Bell. “Try not to exercise within three to four hours of your bedtime. However, if that is the only time you can be physically active, it is still recommended that you do so, just be mindful of having a strong bedtime routine,” she says.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
