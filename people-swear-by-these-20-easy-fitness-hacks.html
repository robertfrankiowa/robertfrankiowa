    <main><h1>People swear by these 20 easy fitness hacks</h1><p>Working out isn't always easy, but these 20 tips work for others. They just might work for you, too. </p><figure><img title="People swear by these 20 easy fitness hacks" src="IMG/BB1jpgyE_people_swear_by_these_20_easy_fitness_hacks.jpg" alt="People swear by these 20 easy fitness hacks"><figcaption><em>People swear by these 20 easy fitness hacks.

Take the thought out of preparation the morning of by getting everything ready the night before. If you’re not wearing spandex to the gym, you might even be able to sleep in your workout clothes.</p><h2>Strap on ankle weights</h2><p>If you want to increase your workout difficulty, utilize ankle weights. They’re not suitable for every workout, but if you’re walking on the treadmill or doing pilates, ankle weights can increase intensity and give you more resistance. </p><h2>Choose a workout plan</h2><p>Personal trainers exist for a reason. Not everyone knows how to choose the right workout for their fitness goals, especially every day, so let someone else plan for you by selecting a weeks- or months-long workout plan. All you have to do is show up and follow instructions. </p><h2>Pair your workout with a reward</h2><p>Working out shouldn’t feel like a punishment that deserves a reward for completing it, but if it does, go ahead and give yourself that reward. Whether it’s getting a coffee from a stand near your gym or just spending 10 minutes on the floor before getting up after your workout, treat yourself. </p><h2>Work out while you watch TV</h2><p>If you have appointment TV but still need to work out, do both simultaneously. Watching a program you like will make your workout go by faster, and it’s a great way to time specific exercises. Whatever it takes to be just a little healthier. </p><h2>Find a workout buddy</h2><p>Having someone to hold you accountable is the oldest trick in the book. It might not even sound like a fitness hack, but it works. Whether you’re working out together via Zoom or meeting up to go for a run, having a buddy makes working out more fun and ensures you get it done. </p><h2>Pay for a class ahead of time</h2><p>Exercise classes are expensive, and not wanting to waste money can motivate you to get your workout in. Rather than waiting to pay until you arrive at the studio, pay online ahead of time if possible so the class is set in your schedule, and you have fewer reasons to bail. </p><h2>Find something you actually like to do</h2><p>Again, this isn’t groundbreaking information, but it bears repeating. If you hate the movement you’re doing when you’re working out, you won’t want to continue. Exercise comes in many forms, so find something you enjoy to make sure you stick to it. </p><h2>Buy cute workout clothes</h2><p>A good outfit can inspire you to get even the worst tasks done. If all it takes to fit in a workout is wearing exercise clothes you like, buy the cutest options you can. And if you need to wear a full face of makeup to the gym, do that. What’s important is that you’re going. </p><h2>Keep your equipment in your car</h2><p>If you’re frequently on the go, make sure you have what you need for a workout on hand. Keep shoes, a yoga mat, an extra pair of socks, and anything else you might need at a moment’s notice in a bag in your car so that you’re always prepared to fit in a workout. </p><h2>Pair your workout with something you hate</h2><p>This sounds odd, but it works for a lot of people. If you have to watch a training video for work or complete an errand you’ve been putting off for weeks, get your workout in simultaneously. You can watch what you need to watch while on the treadmill and walk or run to finish your errand. Then, your workout and your agonizing task are both complete. </p><h2>Work out to your favorite songs</h2><p>Like watching television while working out, songs make great natural timers for workouts. Doing an exercise you hate will be much more bearable if you’re listening to a song you love, making it seem like time is going by faster. </p><figure><img title="Work out to your favorite songs" src="IMG/BB1jpgzz_work_out_to_your_favorite_songs.jpg" alt="Work out to your favorite songs"><figcaption><em>Work out to your favorite songs.

Resistance bands can go around your arms, legs, or waist, leaving you feeling sore and accomplished. Like ankle weights, they don’t work for every move, but they’re wonderful when used correctly. </p><figure><img title="Utilize resistance bands" src="IMG/BB1ltlh6_utilize_resistance_bands.jpg" alt="Utilize resistance bands"><figcaption><em>Utilize resistance bands.

A fancy home gym can run you thousands, as can classes and gym memberships. Cut those costs by using household items instead. Books can be used for weights. Towels can be used for yoga mats. Get creative. </p><h2>Wear your gym clothes all day</h2><p>If you don’t have time to work out until the end of the day and fear you won’t want to fit it in by the time you finish the rest of your tasks, wear your gym clothes (if appropriate) all day. If you work from home or are running errands, do it in your gym clothes. It’s one less thing you have to do when it’s time to work out.</p><h2>Put your workout on your to-do list</h2><p>If you live and die by your to-do list or love the satisfaction of crossing something off your list, put your workout on your to-do list. This will make you much more likely to actually work out, and you’ll feel even better when you get it done. </p><h2>Split your workout</h2><p>Splitting your workout can come in different forms. It can be two or three 10-minute workouts in succession to focus on different parts of your body, or it can be a 20-minute HIIT workout early in the day and a 20-minute walk late in the day. Splitting things up can make the task more manageable. </p><h2>Try compound movements</h2><p>Work smarter while working harder by completing a workout of compound movements. These will work more areas of the body at once, so you’ll be engaging more muscles. </p><figure><img title="Try compound movements" src="IMG/BB1jpuTr_try_compound_movements.jpg" alt="Try compound movements"><figcaption><em>Try compound movements.

Drinking pre-workout can give you energy and result in a better workout. If it works for you, do it. </p><h2>Carve out a gym space in your home</h2><p>Finding a place to work out at home can be difficult, but if you designate even a little area for working out, it can make a world of difference. Keep your equipment there and tell yourself you’re going to the gym whenever you’re fitting in a home workout. </p></main>
