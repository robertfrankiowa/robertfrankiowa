It’s also about the steps you’re taking to achieve the healthiest version of you. While there isn’t one “right” or “best” way to achieve ultimate health, we know that there are recommendations that almost everyone can follow. Sleep, hydration, movement, and mental health all play a role in feeling our best. </p><p>Research shows that what you eat matters too. One of the easiest ways to consume the variety of nutrients you need for optimal health is by following a Mediterranean-style eating pattern. Ranked as the #1 diet by U.S. News and World, it’s less of a diet and more of a way of life. Instead of restriction, the focus is on inclusion, with an emphasis on plant-based foods. Whole grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood as well as healthy fats from nuts, seeds, and olive oil are the pillars of this eating style since they’re commonly found and consumed in this region of the world. Studies support munching the Mediterranean way, as it can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes as well as cognitive decline. </p><h2>The Foods to Focus On For Ultimate Health</h2><p>Fortunately, the foods that benefit health are also some of the most delicious and readily available. </p><h3>Fruits, Vegetables, and Whole Grains</h3><p>There’s a reason Registered Dietitians recommend consuming more plants. Not only are they accessible and economical (think dried grains and beans and fresh, canned, or frozen fruits and vegetables), but they’re packed with nutrients, says Maggie Moon, MS, RD, brain health nutrition expert and best-selling author of The MIND Diet. “I recommend people focus on adding dark green leafy vegetables and dark berries to their diet.” These foods, she says, are antioxidant-rich and keep our cells healthy, fighting off the damaging effects of free radicals. They’re also a great way to get more fiber into your diet. Fiber is important for satiety, but also benefits gastrointestinal health, and can help with the prevention of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. </p><h3>Healthy Fats</h3><p>Brain, eye, and heart health are important pieces to the ultimate health puzzle. Consuming healthy fats, including omega-3s is one way to benefit them all. The NIH recommends consuming 1.1-1.6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day, which you can get from fatty fish (such as salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseed and flaxseed oil, chia seeds, canola oil, and walnuts. Find fun ways to incorporate these foods, says Moon. For example, she likes to use walnut crumbles to replace some of the ground turkey when making the filling for lettuce wraps.</p><h3>Lean Proteins</h3><p>Focus on more beans, lentils, fish, and seafood. These naturally lean sources of protein are the perfect pairing for this plant-forward way of eating. You need protein for building and maintaining muscle, hair, and skin, but also for making antibodies, enzymes, and hormones. Protein is important to support your metabolism and is a primary fuel source for our bodies. If you choose beef or other sources of animal protein, choose leaner cuts which will have less total fat and saturated fat than higher-fat cuts. </p><h2>7-Day Meal Plan for Ultimate Health</h2><p>The meal plan below is based on a Mediterranean-style diet with approximately 2,000 calories per day.

Our bodies are made of mostly water and women require about 11 ½ cups per day (for men, 15 ½ cups per day), according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, to keep all of our systems working smoothly. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and dizziness. Hydration isn't necessarily about what you drink, achieve your hydration goals through foods too. Focus on vegetables and fruits, which can contain up to 90% water!</p><p><strong>Sleep</strong>. Getting a good night's sleep is an important part of ultimate health. Most adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night according to the National Institutes for Health. Sleep restores the body, allowing it to reset for the next day. It’s an important factor in heart health, immunity, and metabolism. Set yourself up for sleep success by finding ways to relax before bedtime, which means turning off all of your devices. </p><p><strong>Stress Management</strong>. Stress and anxiety can take their toll on your body, especially over time. It can affect everything from your heart health to your gastrointestinal health, placing you at risk for developing chronic disease. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to manage stress, says Jessica Swift Harrell MSc, RDN, LD, IFNCP. She recommends having your own personal self-care routine which can include things like yoga, journaling, or practicing mindfulness like qi gong to manage stress. Mediation, breathing techniques, and exercise can also be beneficial.</p></main>
