Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few months ago, stepping inside a weight room sounded as scary as singing back up during a sold out Taylor Swift show. Even though I've been lifting weights for years, I still get "gymxiety," which is not a medical term, but it's how I refer to the fear, intimidation, and anxiety of working out in front of strangers. And if you've never actually stepped foot inside of a fitness center, the experience can be particularly stressful.</p><h2>Why Do We Get Gymxiety?</h2><p>"I think it’s a vulnerable experience to go into an unfamiliar environment to utilize unfamiliar machines that at times seem complicated," says Linda Ruvalcaba, an Arizona-based licensed professional counselor. According to Ruvalcaba, anxiety can happen in new environments when we don't fully trust ourselves. "Anxiety wants us to have all the answers, and be the most prepared, "she says. "But life is about trusting in ourselves to be able to cope and manage with whatever we encounter."</p><p>Over time, with lots of patience and many baby steps, I’ve become confident enough to work out nearly anywhere. If exercising in front of others stresses you out, know that it's completely common and may take some time to work through. Below are a few things that have helped me deal with "gymtimidation," in addition to tips from others who have been there and advice from fitness experts, too.</p><h2>Strategies to Help Overcome Gymxiety</h2><h3>1. Build a support system.</h3><p>For a number of reasons, typical gyms never felt very welcoming, Ruvalcaba says. They have historically been associated with muscular and/or thin body types, can be really crowded, and are full of unfamiliar equipment, she explains. “I suddenly feel like I’m in the spotlight when I get on a machine,” Ruvalcaba says. “I feel embarrassed if I don’t initially know how to use it.”</p><p>Last summer, Ruvalcaba started going to a local gym and says going with family made the process easier. “My sister talked me through how to do the machines and how many reps to do," she says. “My mom is really good at correcting my form.”</p><p>Don’t have a gym buddy? Ask a friend to be your virtual hype person, advises Gerren Liles, a New York City–based fitness trainer with Lululemon Studio. “You can let your support system know that you’re going to the gym and check-in for reassurance,” he says. I tested this recently by messaging my personal trainer or a friend whenever I felt self-conscious—like when I asked a stranger to use a machine while they rested (eek!)— and it really helped!</p><h3>2. Try a group fitness class.</h3><p>Deadlifting in a packed gym is wildly different from practicing yoga in your living room, where your dog is the only spectator. If you’re trying to make the leap from private to public workouts, try taking a group fitness class first, Liles suggests. “When you take a class, you're in an environment where you're conditioning yourself to be around other people, and you get some coaching,” Liles says. “Obviously the instructor can't focus on you completely, but you will get a good basic idea of how to do the exercises.”</p><p>Over time, you may feel ready to explore new areas of the gym—or you may realize that group classes are your happy place. “Once I discovered group classes, my whole life changed,” says Emily Gerard, a New York City resident who is devoted to the Pilates, strength, and HIIT classes at Equinox. “Someone has already put in the mental energy to come up with a good way to spend 45 minutes at the gym,” Gerard says. “If you're doing something wrong, the instructor will gently show you how not to hurt yourself. And you're in a group, so you don't feel like you stick out.”  </p><h3>3. Come prepared.</h3><p>Gyms are really not the place to be spontaneous—especially if they make you anxious. “Researching and writing down your exercises ahead of time is the best way to walk in with confidence,” says Madeline Danza, CSCS, a New York City-based certified strength and conditioning specialist. Full disclosure: Danza is also my fitness coach. “Even a gym veteran could feel uncomfortable going in without a plan and aimlessly walking around trying to find things and brainstorm their workout on the fly,” she says.</p><p>Creating a gym routine takes a considerable amount of fitness knowledge, so you may want to use a fitness app that offers structured routines. (Ruvalcaba likes the Alpha Progression app, and I personally have used and liked Centr.) </p><p>Because I want to feel as prepared as possible when I’m doing something intimidating, I always review my workouts at home. This way, I can visualize where any equipment is located and plan my route. If I’m confused about form or how to use a particular piece of equipment, I ask my trainer or watch YouTube videos. I’ve even created a “workout album” in my phone with photos and videos of workouts that I can refer back to if I need a refresher. (It’s so easy to get both useful and harmful information online, so it’s a good idea to choose reputable sources, like fitness professionals accredited by organizations like NASM or health publications that you trust.)</p><h3>4. Wear clothes that make you feel good.</h3><p>I feel like Goldilocks when it comes to finding the perfect workout clothes. Some leggings are too tight; some don’t pass the squat test; and some roll down at the waist when I move. (Don’t even get me started on finding shorts that don’t ride up!) I’ve found that the right gear goes a long way in boosting my confidence because it’s impossible to focus when I’m fidgeting with my pants or pulling my shirt down.</p><p>The problem is that it’s so hard to know whether something is comfortable until your body is contorted during a workout. After a lot of trial and error I’ve found some favorite pieces that make me feel good, and I highly recommend them if you're looking for something new!</p><ul><li>The Lululemon Wunder Train legging is one of my go-to pairs for strength training because it offers medium compression and a supportive waistband. They stay put no matter what I'm doing and never dig into my skin (which happens when pants are too compressive). </li><li>I recently tried the Vuori Daily Bra, and it's the only sports bra I ever want to wear. It's easy to take off unlike some other sports bras, which make me feel like I'm going to dislocate a shoulder in the process. It has just two wide straps, meaning no weird criss-cross design to figure out. </li><li>And if I'm doing any sort of cardio, I make sure to wear my Feetures socks (the Elite Max Cushion No Show style). They're plush and stay in place, so I can run for miles without having my sneakers rub against my heel. </li></ul><p>For me, being comfortable when I'm doing something that's <em>highly</em> uncomfortable makes all the difference!</p><h3>5. Give yourself a pep talk.</h3><p>When Ruvalcaba feels her anxiety rising at the gym, she takes a deep breath and gives herself a pep talk:“You are here to work out. It's OK for you to learn something new,” Ruvalcaba reminds herself.</p><h3>6. Remember that the gym is for everyone—including you. </h3><p>While I know that comparing myself to others never leads to anything positive, I can’t help but feel insecure working out beside people who lift heavier weights than I do. If the gym is busy, and I’m using one of the few benches, I get anxious that others are judging me for taking resources they believe they need and deserve to use more than I do. I’m positive that no one thinks that, and even if they did, everyone deserves to use the space.</p><p>If you feel this way too, remember that the gym is for everyone, Danza emphasizes. “You pay the same membership fee as anyone else on the gym floor,” she says. “The more veteran gym members don’t pay a higher fee to have elite access to the equipment, so no one should feel like they have any less entitlement than anyone else.” </p><p>If you're able to, look into hiring a fitness professional while you work on becoming more confident inside the gym. “Obviously, one of the best things that you can do is to invest in a personal trainer who can show you proper form,” Liles says. And I agree with him. I’ve worked with Danza for more than six months and can say it is one of the best things I’ve done for myself. Having my form corrected a zillion times by a professional makes me feel like I know what I’m doing. Plus, she’s the ultimate hype woman whenever that pesky imposter syndrome kicks in.</p></main>
