    <main><h1>The Best Spa Resorts in the United States for a Relaxing Getaway</h1><h2>Boulders Resort Spa Scottsdale Curio Collection By Hilton Via Tripadvisor</h2><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                   Book On Tripadvisor                </p><h2 class="ap-card-superlative">       Best for groups     </h2><h3 class="ap-card-title">       Boulders Resort & Spa Scottsdale, Curio Collection by Hilton     </h3><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                  Book On Tripadvisor                </p><p class="pros-title">Pros:</p><ul> <li>      An abundance of on-site activities and amenities, including a wide range of treatments, outdoor activities and more than 40 free fitness classes    </li> <li>      Stunning desert surroundings    </li> <li>      Luxury rooms and suites with wood-burning fireplaces    </li> </ul><p class="cons-title">Cons:</p><ul> <li>      The property, which spans 1,200 acres, may be too large for those seeking a secluded stay    </li> </ul><p>Scottsdale, Arizona is best known as the spa capital of America, and Boulders Resort & Spa Scottsdale is reason enough to visit Arizona. Situated in the foothills of the Sonoran Desert, setting the scene for a rejuvenating girls weekend getaway, this sprawling property truly offers something for every traveler, be it outdoor adventures, relaxing spa services, on-site golf, great food and, well, everything else in between.</p><p>At the 33,000-square-foot adults-only spa (free to enter, even if you don't book a service!), wellness-seeking travelers can indulge in treatments that run the gamut from Ayurvedic massages with locally sourced clay to vitamin C facials and body polishes featuring grapefruit- and jasmine-infused salt. Pre- or post-treatment, enjoy a soak in the spa's adults-only pool—though it's worth noting that the resort boasts several other sparkling swimming pools—meditate in the labyrinth or unwind in the garden or by the reflecting pond.</p><p>Spending time in nature can also help relieve stress, which is why guests should certainly sign up for outdoor adventures like rock climbing, biking, horseback riding, hiking and hot-air balloon rides. Finally, rest your head in one of the luxe desert-inspired rooms and suites, all offering wood-beam ceilings, stone showers, a patio or balcony and, best of all, wood-burning fireplaces.</p><figure><img title="Boulders Resort Spa Scottsdale Curio Collection By Hilton Via Tripadvisor" src="IMG/BB1nAMEq_boulders_resort_spa_scottsdale_curio_collection_by_hilton_via_tripadvisor.jpg" alt="Boulders Resort Spa Scottsdale Curio Collection By Hilton Via Tripadvisor"><figcaption><em>Boulders Resort Spa Scottsdale Curio Collection By Hilton Via Tripadvisor. </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Amangiri Jaala Suite Via Tripadvisor E1681398735660</h2><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                   Book On Tripadvisor                </p><h2 class="ap-card-superlative">       Best splurge     </h2><h3 class="ap-card-title">       Amangiri     </h3><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                  Book On Tripadvisor                </p><p class="pros-title">Pros:</p><ul> <li>      Uber-luxe accommodations    </li> <li>      Meals are included, as are guided hikes and private airport transfers    </li> <li>      Picture-perfect surroundings flanked by towering red rocks    </li> </ul><p class="cons-title">Cons:</p><p>Spanning more than 900 acres in rural Canyon Point, Utah, Amangiri is considered one of America's most luxurious resorts, and it's easy to see why. This dynamic property attracts well-heeled travelers and celebrities for its secluded locale and postcard-worthy desert landscape—including awe-inspiring red rocks at every angle.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the resort is home to one of the most beautiful spas in the country. The Aman Spa at Amangiri is more than 25,000 square feet and offers a holistic menu inspired by sacred Navajo healing traditions. Consider booking the Grounding Journey, which includes a body polish and wrap, a full-body massage and a 45-minute scalp treatment. The spa amenities—such as a water pavilion (complete with a steam room, sauna, plunge pool and step pool) and a flotation pavilion with a tranquil relaxation area—are just as amazing as the treatments themselves.</p><p>Should you need a break from the spa (though we wouldn't blame you if you didn't!), consider one of several bucket-list excursions, including a short guided hike followed by an outdoor yoga session overlooking the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Alternatively, keep it simple and take a dip in the majestic swimming pool, which is built around ancient rocks, or relax in your swanky suite.</p><h2>Peppermill Reno Resort Via Tripadvisor E1681398871885</h2><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                   Book On Tripadvisor                </p><h2 class="ap-card-superlative">       Best budget     </h2><h3 class="ap-card-title">       Peppermill Reno Resort     </h3><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                  Book On Tripadvisor                </p><p class="pros-title">Pros:</p><p class="cons-title">Cons:</p><ul> <li>      Those who prefer a more boutique, intimate ambiance may be turned off by how large the resort is    </li> </ul><p>We don't know who needs to hear this, but you don't need to blow your entire travel budget for the year on a stay at a single spa resort. There are plenty of cheap places to travel for a killer spa vacation. Just take Peppermill Reno Resort in Reno, Nevada, for example. This budget-friendly property—which is among the best spa resorts in the USA—is a favorite among wellness enthusiasts for its 33,000-square-foot, adults-only, Mediterranean-inspired Spa Toscana, which spans three stories.</p><p>Spa guests can take advantage of an abundance of amenities, like hot and cold plunge pools, cascading showers, cedarwood saunas and a Himalayan salt wall. We'd also be remiss not to mention that the spa is home to Nevada's only caldarium (a hot plunge bath that dates back to Roman times), boasting an indoor pool and spa deck. Services here are anything but basic and include a handful of vinotherapy treatments—such as a body wrap that uses a combination of cabernet and neroli oils—and a birthday cake massage complete with your choice of cupcake.</p><p>Meanwhile, the resort itself is massive. You'll find 600 rooms, an 82,000-square-foot casino, a 9,900-square-foot fitness center, two pools, several bars and lounges and nine restaurants. In other words, you need not even step foot off the property.</p><figure><img title="Peppermill Reno Resort Via Tripadvisor E1681398871885" src="IMG/BB1nARva_peppermill_reno_resort_via_tripadvisor_e1681398871885.jpg" alt="Peppermill Reno Resort Via Tripadvisor E1681398871885"><figcaption><em>Peppermill Reno Resort Via Tripadvisor E1681398871885. </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Sensei Lanai A Four Seasons Resort Via Tripadvisor E1681399037787</h2><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                   Book On Tripadvisor                </p><h2 class="ap-card-superlative">       Best for couples     </h2><h3 class="ap-card-title">       Sensei Lanai, A Four Seasons Resort     </h3><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                  Book On Tripadvisor                </p><p class="pros-title">Pros:</p><ul> <li>      Lush surroundings set the scene for a romantic vacation    </li> <li>      Free fitness and wellness classes    </li> <li>      The property offers both inclusive packages and à la carte options    </li> </ul><p class="cons-title">Cons:</p><p>Look no further than Sensei Lanai for the ultimate couples trip.

After your spa treatment, enjoy a swim in the outdoor pool surrounded by lush flora, stroll through the garden (complete with 10 soaking tubs for the ultimate R&R), take a yoga class or play a round of golf. The light-filled rooms and suites here are also astonishing: Each has a private, furnished lanai for lounging in style.</p><h2>Civana Wellness Resort Spa Via Tripadvisor</h2><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                   Book On Tripadvisor                </p><h2 class="ap-card-superlative">       Best wellness     </h2><h3 class="ap-card-title">       Civana Wellness Resort & Spa     </h3><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                  Book On Tripadvisor                </p><p class="pros-title">Pros:</p><p class="cons-title">Cons:</p><ul> <li>      Not a ton of dining options    </li> </ul><p>If you don't arrive in the town of Carefree, Arizona with a laid-back attitude, you'll find it at Civana Wellness Resort & Spa. Tucked into the Sonoran Desert, this gem has earned its place as one of the best spa resorts in Arizona, and not just because the setting is bound to leave you blissed out. The resort boasts a 22,000-square-foot spa with 22 treatment rooms that focus on healing through water. Alongside Eastern and Western therapies, you'll find one-of-a-kind offerings, like an aqua therapy circuit featuring hot and cold pools.</p><p>Wellness enthusiasts will appreciate the resort's health-focused approach—and the more than a dozen complimentary classes. Here, you'll find everything from suspension training to aerial yoga to morning hikes. After you move your body, work on your mind with intention-setting or learn meditation. For a real health holiday, sign up for a wellness experience like the Chopra Health Retreat, Joyful Journey or Path to Connection.</p><p>Before you end the night in your airy, spa-inspired room, dine at one of the resort's two restaurants, where the focus is on fresh, seasonal food. All in all, Civana makes a really great case for that Arizona road trip you've been dying to take.</p><h2>Sea Island Resort Via Tripadvisor</h2><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                   Book On Tripadvisor                </p><h2 class="ap-card-superlative">       Best for seclusion     </h2><h3 class="ap-card-title">       Sea Island Resort     </h3><p class="ap-card-button-wrap retailer-primary ">                  Book On Tripadvisor                </p><p class="pros-title">Pros:</p><ul> <li>      A private island setting ideal for seclusion    </li> <li>      Ocean-inspired spa treatments and ample amenities    </li> <li>      Three hotel options    </li> </ul><p class="cons-title">Cons:</p><ul> <li>      Three hotel options    </li> </ul><p>Just over an hour from Jacksonville, Florida, and 75 minutes from Savannah, this private island resort is well worth a spot on your bucket list.

The luxury spa offers an indoor pool, hydrotherapy, posh relaxation lounges, steam rooms, saunas and even a Snow Room. You can also head outside for a dip in the outdoor whirlpool, which is open year-round and offers pristine views of the stunning mountain surroundings.</p><p>All guests gain access to spa facilities (whether or not they actually book treatments, though we highly recommend the Restorative Herbal Massage or the Himalayan Salt Stone Massage). Additionally, the spa resort offers complimentary art, mind and body classes, cooking and baking demos, speakers and workshops, an expansive fitness center and a variety of outdoor excursions—all of which are included in your stay. Guests also enjoy lavish accommodations (all 59 rooms and suites offer private balconies overlooking the private lake or rock garden) and three gourmet meals per day.</p><p>When looking for the best spa resorts, "privacy is a major factor when making a decision on a spa resort," travel expert Rob DelliBovi explains. "Our clients expect that they will not deal with crowds or lines when having this type of experience. We want quiet, healthy and high-end." DelliBovi adds that you should also speak to the resort sales and concierge teams beforehand to vet them and ensure they can offer the type of experience you need. "The employees per guest ratio and the number of sleeping rooms versus treatment areas in the hotel are important," he adds.</p><h2>Why you should trust us</h2><p>Lauren Dana Ellman is a writer and editor specializing in travel.

In this case, we categorized any resort with a spacious, amenity-packed spa and varied treatment offerings as a "spa resort." In most cases, the spa was the top—if not the main—draw for staying at the property.</p><p>With this definition in mind, we considered everything from expansive properties to small—and medium-sized boutique hotels, some of which were all-inclusive. We also chose properties across different price points to suit any and every budget. From there, we got to work hand-picking hotels that best fit these criteria. We also cross-referenced our picks with user reviews and ratings across booking sites like Tripadvisor to ensure a relaxing experience.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Do any all-inclusive resorts include spa treatments?</h3><p>Even though many resorts are all-inclusive, spa treatments are not typically included unless specified. Most properties run special promotions on specific treatments during holidays and the off-season, so you can check with the concierge before booking.</p><p>The most common spa service is massages, which are listed first on your resort's spa list. When you book, you should also have the option for singles, couples and other add-ons.</p></main>
