Unlike other proteins in your body, amyloid cannot be broken down and recycled. As such, the build-up of amyloid can result in symptoms that affect and damage multiple organ systems including your kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, and bones.</p><p>There are several types of amyloidosis, but the most common type is AL (primary) amyloidosis. In the U.S., approximately 4,500 people receive a diagnosis for this type of amyloidosis. Those most at risk of AL amyloidosis are people between 50 and 80 years of age.</p><h2>Nephrotic Symptoms</h2><p>Nephrotic (kidney-related) symptoms often happen when the build-up of amyloid affects the ability of your kidneys to filter blood. Because your kidneys aren't filtering blood properly, your body isn't able to get rid of the waste and toxins, which can lead to kidney failure and other symptoms such as:</p><ul><li>Excessive amount of proteins in your urine</li><li>Swelling in your body</li><li>Low amounts of protein in your blood</li><li>High cholesterol</li></ul><h2>Cardiac Symptoms</h2><p>When amyloid builds up in your heart muscles, you may experience various cardiac (heart-related) symptoms. Sometimes, too much build-up can cause your heart muscles to stiffen up and lead to a condition called restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy often leads to heart failure. Other cardiac symptoms of amyloidosis may include:</p><ul><li>Irregular heartbeat</li><li>Palpitations</li><li>Chest pain</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Sudden loss of consciousness</li><li>Swelling in your feet and legs</li></ul><h2>Pulmonary Symptoms</h2><p>Pulmonary (lung-related) amyloidosis occurs due to amyloid build-up in the trachea (windpipe), larynx (voice box), and nasal sinuses. This can lead to a blockage in your airways, which can cause symptoms such as:</p><ul><li>Cough, often accompanied by mucus or blood </li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Wheezing </li><li>Fluid build-up in the lungs </li><li>Recurrent respiratory tract infections</li><li>Lung failure, over time</li></ul><h2>Gastrointestinal Symptoms</h2><p>Your gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a passageway that connects your mouth to your anus. Amyloidosis in the GI tract can affect any organ including your esophagus, intestines, stomach, and colon. As a result, you may experience the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>Unintentional weight loss</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Constipation</li><li>Bloating</li><li>Nausea and vomiting</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Internal bleeding</li></ul><h2>Neurological Symptoms</h2><p>When amyloid build up in your nerves, the blood vessels that supply blood to your nerves, or in tissues located near your nerves, you will likely experience neurological (brain-related) symptoms. Because your brain serves as the control center for the rest of your body, you may experience symptoms that affect different parts of the body. These symptoms may include:</p><ul><li>Tingling or burning sensation in the hands or feet</li><li>Feeling lightheaded when standing</li><li>Difficulty walking and keeping balance</li><li>Sexual dysfunction</li><li>Lack of sweating</li></ul><h2>Musculoskeletal Symptoms</h2><p>Amyloidosis can also affect your musculoskeletal system, which includes your bones, joints, and muscles. A build-up of amyloid proteins in this system can cause:</p><ul><li>Joint pain in your wrists, shoulders, knees, hips, or elbows</li><li>Swelling in the joints </li><li>Muscle weakness </li><li>Thickening of muscle tissue</li><li>Bone fractures </li><li>Loss of bone density </li><li>Body aches </li><li>Fluid build-up in the bones </li></ul><h2>Dermatological Symptoms</h2><p>The build-up of amyloid can happen between the dermis and epidermis layers of the skin. This can cause dermatological (skin-related) symptoms that affect the color and texture of your skin. There are three types of amyloidosis that specifically target your skin and cause patches to form. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Macular amyloidosis: </strong>The patches are dark brown in color, flat, and mildly itchy. They mostly develop in the upper back.</li><li><strong>Lichen amyloidosis:</strong> The patches are reddish brown in color, scaly, and quite itchy. These patches usually occur below the knees.</li><li><strong>Nodular amyloidosis: </strong>The patches are firm, raised bumps that appear red, brown, or pink in color. These nodules are not itchy, but may develop on your face and limbs.</li></ul><h2>Systemic Symptoms</h2><p>Systemic amyloidosis occurs when the condition spreads throughout your whole body, affecting several organ systems at the same time. When this happens, you may experience:</p><ul><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Unintentional weight loss</li><li>Malaise (or, a general feeling of being unwell)</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Swelling in your limbs</li></ul><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Because symptoms of amyloidosis often mimic the symptoms of several other conditions, this disease is hard for providers to diagnose. Still, you should see a healthcare provider if you notice changes to your physical well-being and experience symptoms of amyloidosis. It's a good idea to see your provider as soon as possible if you're having any of the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>Difficulty breathing</li><li>Excessive and unintentional weight loss</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Irregular heartbeat</li><li>Extreme weakness</li><li>Swelling throughout your body </li></ul><p>Healthcare providers can recommend several tests to confirm an amyloidosis diagnosis such as blood tests, imaging tests, genetic tests, tissue biopsies, and urine tests.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Amyloidosis is a rare condition that occurs when a build-up of amyloid affects your organs and tissues. This disease can cause damage in one or more of your body systems at the same time, including your kidneys, heart, lungs, GI tract, brain, bones, joints, muscles, and skin. If you have symptoms that affect any of these organs, see your healthcare provider for proper testing. If left untreated, this condition can lead to serious complications, like organ failure.</p></main>
