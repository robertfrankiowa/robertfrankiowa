Some may need to be walked once a day, while others need up to three walks, according to the American Kennel Club. Sporting and working dogs, such as Doberman pinschers, need ample activity and exercise daily. On the other hand, toy breeds, like Pomeranians, prefer to be lapdogs, according to the American Kennel Club. </p><p>Similar to humans, younger dogs have more energy than their older counterparts, according to PetMD. This means younger dogs might need more walks. If your dog is 4 years old or younger, they are also more likely to engage in play compared to older dogs, PetMD reports.</p><p>Older dogs may also suffer from health conditions like diabetes or arthritis. Certain ailments may play a role in lowering stamina, making them less inclined to exercise or go on walks, according to PetMD.</p><figure><img title="Anne-Marie Caruso/NorthJersey.com" src="IMG/BB1pNtWx_how_long_should_i_walk_my_dog_and_how_often_tips_to_keep_your_pup_healthy.jpg" alt="How long should I walk my dog?

If your dog is overweight or has health issues, a 10-minute walk will suffice. </p><p>With busy personal schedules, we don't always have the time for lengthy walks with our pet. As a general rule, it is recommended to walk your dog between 10 and 15 minutes a day, according to PetMD. If this doesn't fit your schedule, 10 to 15 minutes of activity at home can be an alternative to a walk outside.</p><figure><img title="Marc Vasconcellos/The Enterprise" src="IMG/BB1pNydz_how_long_should_i_walk_my_dog_and_how_often_tips_to_keep_your_pup_healthy.jpg" alt="How long should I walk my dog?

Some puppies may even need potty breaks every hour.</p><p>Senior dogs also pee more frequently since they cannot hold their bladder as long as younger dogs. Owners should wait between four to six hours before taking out older dogs again, Purina suggests.</p><p>If your dog has health issues, it may also contribute to more frequent urination. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Should I let my dog sniff on walks?</h2><p>Dogs enjoy sniffing on walks because it lets them know who else has gone to the bathroom in that spot, the American Kennel Club reports.</p><p>Since your dog wants to make their mark on the area, they will sniff out the best spot to do so. Some male dogs will even lift their back leg as high as possible so their pee can reach other dogs' nose levels, according to the American Kennel Club. </p><p>Sometimes, your dog might scratch the ground to further leave its signature. Dogs have glands in their toes that produce scents when they dig into the ground, amping up the smell profile.</p><p><strong>Why do dogs eat poop? </strong>How you can get your pet to stop.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Just Curious for more?
