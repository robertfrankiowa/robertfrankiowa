Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many people complain about sudden weight gain after a long holiday. This is because they have indulged in stimulating and greasy foods, making them feel heavier than usual. While there’s a common saying, “quickly gained, quickly lost,” is it possible to lose the weight you’ve gained quickly?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Two weeks of golden time</h2><p>If you consume more carbohydrates than usual in a short period, the excess energy is absorbed by the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If glycogen remains accumulated for about two weeks, the body will lack sufficient space to store glucose as glycogen. At this point, glycogen turns into body fat. Therefore, if you burn fat within two weeks before it turns into body fat, you can quickly lose the weight you’ve gained.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The initial weight gain might be due to water retention</h2><p>Most sudden weight gain is mainly due to water retention, which can be quickly lost. When the body needs more energy from exercise or fasting, it uses the glycogen stored in it. Once all the glycogen is depleted, the attached water is expelled from the body. This causes a significant reduction in water weight and reduces bloating, making you feel like you’ve lost weight.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What if you miss the two weeks?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1krsu2_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentlife202420240306e0673b53972bdd908f73209bc8cc0245jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/life/2024/20240306/e0673b53972bdd908f73209bc8cc0245.jpg"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>What if you miss the golden time of two weeks? You’ll need about seven times more effort. Fat is a well-stored energy source in the body. To burn fat, you need to consume seven times more calories than when burning glycogen. After the golden time of two weeks, you would need aerobic exercise for seven hours to lose the weight you can lose with one hour of training within two weeks. This shows how precious the golden time is, right?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Actual fat loss begins after six weeks</h2><p>As mentioned, initial weight loss primarily consists of water loss rather than fat. Actual fat loss begins after about six weeks. Weight loss appears significant during the first 4-6 weeks of dieting. However, a considerable portion comprises water or protein loss, not fat. After six weeks, the weight loss rate slows, but the proportion of fat loss increases. This period and beyond can be considered the actual dieting phase.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do not skip meals</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1kriSo_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentlife2024202403064b0fe27030449c77afbfa13d347e4c1djpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/life/2024/20240306/4b0fe27030449c77afbfa13d347e4c1d.jpg"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Skipping meals after you’ve gained weight can be detrimental to weight loss in the long run. Having regular meals is essential as it helps stabilize blood sugar and prevent overeating at the next meal. If preparing every meal feels overwhelming, you can fill your hunger with a light salad, shake, or fruit for breakfast but have a hearty meal for lunch or dinner.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Incorporating muscle exercise is beneficial</h2><p>Combining muscle exercises with your weight loss can yield even more significant benefits. Some women overlook strength training, fearing that gaining muscles from the exercise will lead to gaining weight. However, women typically do not develop bulky muscles like men due to their female hormones. Instead, strength training promotes metabolism, facilitates weight loss, and strengthens bones.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do not blame yourself and get stressed</h2><p>It’s not productive to resent or blame yourself for gaining weight. Those who engage in such behavior often experience feelings of anger and emotional overeating, perpetuating a vicious cycle. Accepting your weight gain and making the most favorable choice is best.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Embrace the feeling of hunger</h2><p>After a long holiday, adhering to a diet can be challenging due to the influx of many foods into your body that may cause intestinal gas and toxins to build up, resulting in bloating. Your digestive organs also need to rest.</p><p>Embracing a moderate hunger level and enjoying that sensation is not necessarily a negative approach.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warm water and 30 minutes a day</h2><p>Thirst can easily lead to overeating. Maintaining regular hydration, preferably with warm water, is essential to support your weight loss efforts. Drinking water about 30 minutes before and after meals aids digestion and gives a sensation of fullness, effectively reducing food intake. Also, make it a habit to do 30 minutes of aerobic exercise each day. Even if you don’t go to the gym, taking stairs instead of using elevators or walking short distances in daily life can be beneficial to increasing your physical activity level.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Quality sleep is essential</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1kre1g_httpsimgdailycokrfileswwwdailycokrcontentlife202420240306712582c474c8eaa194101a0f1dfe6370jpg.jpg" alt="https://img.daily.co.kr/@files/www.daily.co.kr/content/life/2024/20240306/712582c474c8eaa194101a0f1dfe6370.jpg"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even with a strict diet and exercise regimen, slow progress may result from inadequate sleep quality. Insufficient sleep can increase appetite-stimulating hormones while reducing those that promote feelings of fullness, leading to appetite dysregulation. It’s ideal to have at least seven hours of sleep, especially between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. when the growth hormone is most active. Sleep quality matters as much as the quantity, so it’s recommended to use blackout curtains and other ways to ensure a good night’s sleep.</p></main>
