I can quickly detangle my hair easily and suffer from less breakage, which my zig-zag curls are more prone to. It also gives my low porosity hair the perfect dose of hydration without me having to leave the product in my hair for a long time. This is definitely a hero product within the Carol’s Daughter line.”—<em>Danielle James</em></p><figure><img title="Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner" src="IMG/BB1hcDra_detangling_jelly_to_cream_conditioner.jpg" alt="Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner"><figcaption><em>Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Daily Cream Conditioner</h2><p>This conditioner helps strengthen and repair curls, without weighing it down.

I've learned that I don't need an excess of conditioner as the YouTube natural girlies suggested years ago.

Yes, it is capital P pricey, but it’s worth every penny (it’s no wonder nearly every stylist in the book swears by the brand’s patented technology!). After just one wash, my hair feels incredibly soft, and I can miraculously de-tangle it in just a few passes. Even with my long, dense, and wavy mane, a little goes a long way, so it lasts awhile.”—<em>Sam Peters, Hearst and senior commerce editor and ELLE.com contributor </em></p><h2>Meet the Experts</h2><p>Sophie Gutterman, Curl Specialist</p><p>Julissa Prado, founder of Rizos Curls</p><p>Justin Toves-Vincilione, Authentic Beauty Concept advocate and Hairstylist</p><p>Ursula Stephens, Living Proof Celebrity and Brand Stylist</p><p>Aaron Grenia, Co-founder of IGK Hair Care</p><h2>FAQs</h2><p><strong>Why is a great conditioner essential for curly hair?</strong></p><p>“A great conditioner is needed for curly hair because curly hair generally tends to be on the drier side, so conditioner helps to strengthen, nourish and deeply moisturize curls,” says Prado. “This in turn will create healthier hair, promote healthy hair growth, while controlling frizz. Plus, a great conditioner will also help with detangling curls in the shower.”</p><p>Because of the way curly hair is structured, conditioners can make all the difference. “With curly hair, natural oils don’t always make their way down to the end of the strands due to the pattern of the curl. This leaves the ends in need of replenishment and moisture,” says Toves-Vincilione. “A good conditioner, like my favorite Authentic Beauty Concept Hydrate Conditioner, can make your hair more manageable, easier to detangle and can also enhance the full beauty of your natural curl pattern.” For hair health, conditioners are also essential. “It is very important to the right conditioner that will help to hair from becoming brittle,” adds Stephens.</p><p><strong>Do conditioners make a difference when styling curly hair?</strong></p><p>“The type of conditioners you choose to use in your curly hair can dramatically affect the way your finished style turns out,” says Toves-Vincilione. “If your conditioner isn’t moisturizing enough, you may end up with a frizzy result after styling. You want a conditioner that will fully replenish your hair, leaving it hydrated, healed and primed for styling.” Investing in a great conditioner also means you can use fewer styling products afterwards. “Without the conditioner step, curls may require more styling product or not take to the styling product,” says Prado.</p><p><strong>How should you apply conditioner in curly hair?</strong> </p><p>“I like to apply conditioner with my hands to wet hair, from ends up to the scalp while using my fingers to detangle at the same time,” says Stephens. Using a brush can also be a good method. “When you have curly hair most times the only opportunity to brush and detangle is in the shower with a conditioner in it,” says Gutterman. “I make sure to brush the hair with the conditioner in, and let it sit for a few minutes. This allows the cuticle to open up and gives the conditioner a chance to really moisturize the hair.”</p><p><strong>How often should curly hair be conditioned?</strong></p><p>Grenia mentions that it’s important to consistently hydrate your hair, no matter what hair type you have. However, for thick and curly textures, conditioning is especially important. “Every time you wash, you should deep condition, as curly hair can become dryer and more damaged due to the follicle shape,” Grenia says. “Color-treated curls, on top of being dryer than other hair types, are also prone to dullness and loss of luster, due to the way they reflect light which is a bit different compared to straight hair,” he adds. </p><p>Washing your curls with conditioner once a week is generally a good place to start, but try to avoid over-washing, as this can lead to excessive dryness. </p><p>It’s also a good practice to use a leave-in conditioner, a hydrating gel, and a moisturizing oil— post-wash.</p><p><strong>What ingredients should you avoid if you have curly hair?</strong></p><p>“Key ingredients to avoid for all hair types, particularly curly and wavy textures, are surfactant-based sulfates like SLS and SLES. SLS and SLES, or Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate,” says Grenia. He adds that these ingredients can contribute to weakening and drying out the hair. So, next time you’re selecting a conditioner, make sure to check the ingredient label first.</p></main>
