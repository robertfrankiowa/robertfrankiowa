    <main><h1>12 Tips To Reduce Stress And Improve Your Well-Being</h1><p>No one is immune to stress. Life can get hectic sometimes, whether it’s work, relationships, or trying to spin as many plates as possible. While being stressed is inevitable at some point, the way we handle it can make all the difference. We’ve listed 12 tips to help reduce your stress levels and improve your well-being.</p><h2>Learn To Say No</h2><p>If you, like myself, are a people pleaser, you’ll understand how difficult this is. The sheer thought of saying no to someone can fill us with dread as we somehow feel like doing so will let the other person down massively, perhaps resulting in them hating us forever. The truth is, it’s really not that deep. Put yourself first for once, and stop agreeing to do things that you really don’t want to do. Trust me, you’ll feel a lot better for it. </p><figure><img title="Learn To Say No" src="IMG/BB1nuDea_learn_to_say_no.jpg" alt="Learn To Say No"><figcaption><em>Learn To Say No. Photo credit: Canva Pro</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Surround Yourself With Good People</h2><p>Having a strong support network can help you to feel less stressed as surrounding yourself with good people can sort of feel like having a safety net to fall back on. Not to say that you need to become dependent on those good people, but just knowing that you have someone to vent to at least can help take the load off. </p><figure><img title="Surround Yourself With Good People" src="IMG/BB1mDjEe_surround_yourself_with_good_people.jpg" alt="Surround Yourself With Good People"><figcaption><em>Surround Yourself With Good People.

Understanding your emotions or reactions to situations can help you find out more about yourself. Your thoughts and feelings are valid and are there for a reason, so don’t ignore them.</p><h2>Recognize What Your Triggers Are</h2><p>If you can see a pattern forming during times you feel yourself getting stressed, then think about what’s happening right now that’s making you react this way. Feeling stressed or anxious is our mind’s weird way of protecting us. It’s that fight or flight mode we so often hear about. If possible, try to stay away from things that are triggering you. If not, think about why they’re triggering you and take the steps to overcome it.</p><h2>Eat Well</h2><p>I don’t know about you, but when I’m more conscious of my eating habits and take better care of myself when it comes to my diet, I do feel a whole lot better. Even if it’s preparing a cooked meal for yourself instead of ordering a takeout. Sure, it’s a nice treat every once in a while, but eating healthier does wonders for your well-being.</p><figure><img title="Eat Well" src="IMG/BB1ncD20_eat_well.jpg" alt="Eat Well"><figcaption><em>Eat Well.

Telling you that eating healthy food and exercising more often isn’t exactly ground-breaking stuff. We know you know all this. The thing is, it’s being said and repeated a billion times for a reason. Moving your body and being conscious about what you put into it is good for you. Crazy, right?</p><h2>Try Journaling</h2><p>Writing down your thoughts isn’t for everyone. Perhaps some of you haven’t written in a journal since you were in middle school drawing little hearts around your crush’s initials. However, it can be beneficial to get all those thoughts flying around your brain onto a piece of paper. It can help bring clarity or even encourage you to reflect on what’s going on in your life.</p><h2>Take Breaks Throughout The Day</h2><p>If it’s possible for you to do so, take little breaks throughout your day. Even if it’s only for 10-15 minutes at a time. Remove yourself from your desk and make a cup of coffee or go for a quick walk to clear your head. This gives you the time you need to gather your thoughts and breathe. </p><h2>Take Up A Relaxing Hobby</h2><p>Whether it’s painting, knitting, jigsaw puzzles, or sudoku. Try and find an activity that encourages you to think about only the activity itself. Our minds can become so crowded with whatever is going on in our world that we find it difficult to think about anything other than what’s bothering us. Taking a moment to focus on a task, such as baking, can help our stress to subside, if only for a little while. </p><h2>Avoid Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms</h2><p>When you’re going through it, reaching for the bottle or smoking a cigarette can make you feel better momentarily, however, being dependent on substances such as alcohol is going to do us more harm than good in the long run. </p><figure><img title="Avoid Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms" src="IMG/BB1nuDeq_avoid_unhealthy_coping_mechanisms.jpg" alt="Avoid Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms"><figcaption><em>Avoid Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms.

Similar to journaling, getting all those thoughts out of your head will help clear the fog. If you have someone in your life that you can trust who is going to listen to you without judgment, then reach out to them. </p><h2>Quit The Negative Self-Talk</h2><p>Finally, stop being so damn negative to yourself. Even if you’re doing it in a funny ha-ha, self-deprecating humor type of way, there comes a point where you begin to believe everything you say about yourself. Would you speak to a friend in the same way you speak to yourself? No, you wouldn’t. Be kind and compassionate to yourself as you would to anyone else.</p></main>
