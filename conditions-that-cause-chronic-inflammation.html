    <main><h1>Conditions That Cause Chronic Inflammation</h1><p>     <p>And What Symptoms Indicate Low- and High-Grade Inflammation </p><strong>Medically reviewed by Stella Bard, MD</strong><p>Inflammation is the body’s natural defense against injury and infection. Chronic inflammation happens when the body’s inflammatory response activates—sometimes even without injury or illness—and persists over months or years. When chronic inflammation persists, it can cause severe damage to the body, leading to long-term health problems such as heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disease, or diabetes.</p><p>This article discusses the signs and symptoms of chronic inflammation, its long-term effects on the body, and its associated conditions. It also covers what to do if you suspect you have chronic inflammation and treatments that may help. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1kYU8r_woman_sitting_on_the_edge_of_her_bed_taking_pills.jpg" alt="Woman sitting on the edge of her bed, taking pills"><figcaption><em>FG Trade / Getty Images.

Over time, it can weaken your immune system and lead to health problems, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Many conditions are linked to chronic inflammation, including: </p><ul><li><strong>Cardiovascular disease</strong>: Chronic inflammation can damage blood vessels, causing them to narrow or thicken, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems.</li><li><strong>Cancer</strong>: Chronic inflammation can damage the DNA in healthy cells, causing them to mutate (change) into abnormal cells. Cancer develops when these abnormal cells grow and multiply uncontrollably. Research suggests chronic inflammation contributes to 15 to 20% of all cancers.</li><li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong>: Chronic inflammation contributes to insulin resistance—a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Persistent inflammation disrupts normal insulin signaling, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels and the development of diabetes.</li><li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</strong>: RA is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s healthy joint tissues. Research shows rheumatoid arthritis develops years after systemic (widespread) inflammation begins.</li><li><strong>Asthma</strong>: Exposure to allergens (e.g., pollen, pet dander) and environmental irritants (e.g., air pollution, cigarette smoke) can initiate an immune response and chronic inflammation in the airways, leading to asthma.</li><li><strong>Obesity</strong>: A diet high in processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats can trigger chronic low-grade inflammation and contribute to weight gain.</li><li><strong>Endometriosis/Adenomyosis</strong>: Chronic inflammation in the uterus or pelvic area can cause endometrial tissue to grow outside of the uterus (endometriosis) or within the uterine muscle (adenomyosis), causing pelvic pain, severe menstrual cramps, and heavy menstrual bleeding.</li><li><strong>Depression</strong>: Researchers exploring the link between depression and inflammation discovered that chronic inflammation plays a role in the development of depression in some people.</li></ul><p><h3>Acute vs. Chronic Inflammation</h3><p>Acute inflammation is the body’s natural, short-term defense to injury infection. Chronic inflammation persists long after the threat (e.g., illness) has passed and can damage tissues and organs over time. Acute inflammation is beneficial, helping fight bacteria and viruses and promote healing, while chronic inflammation can be harmful and increase the risk of chronic diseases.</p><h2>Chronic Inflammation Symptoms and Signs </h2><p>Chronic inflammation affects nearly every body tissue, process, and system, leading to various bodywide symptoms, which may initially seem mild or vague but worsen over time.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of chronic inflammation include:</p><ul><li>Widespread pain, including joint and muscle pain</li><li>Persistent fatigue </li><li>Insomnia (sleep problems) </li><li>Depression</li><li>Anxiety</li><li>Mood disorders </li><li>Digestive issues, such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and acid reflux (heartburn) </li><li>Frequent infections</li><li>Weight changes </li><li>Skin problems, like eczema or rashes</li></ul><h3>Describing Chronic Inflammation Sensation</h3><p>Chronic inflammation is often subtle, and people may not recognize the signs and symptoms immediately, as they are often vague and nonspecific, meaning they can be associated with numerous conditions. With chronic inflammation, you might feel constant, low-level fatigue or be too tired to do much beyond your daily responsibilities. </p><p>Some people may experience a general feeling of being unwell (malaise) for no discernible reason or have occasional discomfort or pain, such as joint stiffness or low-back pain. Unexplained weight gain or loss is common with chronic inflammation, and some people may experience a fever or swollen lymph nodes.</p><p>Symptoms can worsen over time, and other symptoms may develop, such as skin problems (e.g., rashes), digestive troubles, memory problems, difficulty focusing, and mood changes.</p><p>A flare is a period when chronic inflammation increases. The term “flare-up” is often used to describe when symptoms of an inflammatory or autoimmune disease worsen. Depending on the condition, several factors can trigger flares, including stress, infection, certain foods, injury, and weather changes. Flares can last for days or weeks and have a significant impact on your quality of life.</p><p>Some common characteristics of a flare include:</p><ul><li>Worsening of inflammation symptoms, such as pain and discomfort</li><li>Severe fatigue </li><li>Difficulty sleeping</li><li>Decreased appetite </li><li>Low mood</li></ul><h2>Long-Term Effects of Chronic Inflammation in Body </h2><p>Once the immune system is activated, inflammatory cells release a constant flow of proteins called cytokines, which signal the immune system to release other inflammatory cells and substances into the bloodstream. A prolonged inflammatory response can cause the immune system to become "hyperactive," creating a vicious cycle of inflammation.</p><p>When left unchecked over extended periods, chronic inflammation can take a profound toll on the body and may cause:</p><ul><li>Tissue damage and scarring</li><li>Reduced function of body systems </li><li>Accelerated aging</li><li>Chronic disease </li></ul><h2>Treatments Intended to Improve Chronic Inflammation</h2><p>Several medications help reduce inflammation. Treatments vary depending on the type of inflammatory condition you have and may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong>: Over-the-counter and prescription NSAIDs, such as Advil (ibuprofen), Aleve (naproxen), and aspirin, can reduce inflammation and pain. </li><li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>: Strong anti-inflammatory drugs available in pill, injection, and cream forms to treat severe inflammation.</li><li><strong>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)</strong>: DMARDs are immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., biologics) that target specific molecules involved in the inflammatory process to control inflammation. </li><li><strong>Metformin</strong>: A first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes that has anti-inflammatory effects. </li></ul><h2>Self-Care, Habits, and Well-Being</h2><p>Healthy lifestyle habits and self-care practices can help reduce chronic inflammation and lower your risk of chronic disease. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Proper nutrition</strong>: A diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins gives your body the nutrients it needs for optimal functioning and helps control inflammation. Many fruits and vegetables have anti-inflammatory properties, as do some fatty fish (e.g., salmon), nuts, and seeds. Limit your intake of foods that can trigger inflammation, including processed and fried foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats.</li><li><strong>Regular exercise</strong>: Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, swimming, strength training, or cycling, can help reduce chronic inflammation and support a healthy immune system.</li><li><strong>Quality sleep</strong>: Adults should get seven to nine hours each night to help control inflammation and prevent long-term health problems.</li><li><strong>Regular health check-ups</strong>: Schedule regular checkups with a healthcare provider to monitor your overall health and assess inflammatory markers as needed.</li><li><strong>Stress management</strong>: Stress can trigger inflammation and worsen symptoms. Stress-management techniques, such as exercise, yoga, meditation, and spending time in nature, can help manage inflammation.</li><li><strong>Quitting smoking</strong>: Smoking worsens inflammation, and stopping (or never starting) is one of the best things you can do for your health. </li><li><strong>Supplements</strong>: Some dietary supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and turmeric, have anti-inflammatory properties and can complement a healthy lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Dental care</strong>: Poor dental hygiene can lead to inflammation in the gums and mouth, which can spread to other body areas. Regular dental checkups and cleanings can help prevent gum disease and control inflammation.</li></ul><h2>Undiagnosed Chronic Inflammation: Where to Start </h2><p>If you have symptoms of chronic inflammation, see a healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and address your concerns. During your appointment, the healthcare provider will review your medical history, ask about your symptoms, and perform a physical examination. They may order blood tests or other diagnostic tests to provide an accurate diagnosis. </p><p>Be honest and forthcoming with the healthcare provider at your appointment. Your information will help them understand what’s causing your symptoms. The healthcare provider will want to discuss the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: When they started, how often they occur, and how they impact your day-to-day life</li><li><strong>Medications</strong>: Medicines and supplements you take, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements </li><li><strong>Lifestyle habits</strong>: Your lifestyle habits, including activity levels, diet, and whether you smoke or drink alcohol</li></ul><p>It may take some time to figure out what’s causing your symptoms, arrive at a diagnosis, and develop a treatment plan. A primary care provider (PCP) may refer you to a specialist, such as a rheumatologist or a gastroenterologist if your PCP suspects you have a condition that requires specialized knowledge and treatment. </p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Chronic inflammation can damage tissues, organs, and DNA over time, increasing the risk of many chronic diseases. Signs and symptoms of chronic inflammation include fatigue, joint pain and stiffness, muscle aches, skin rashes, digestive problems, depression, and unexplained weight changes.</p><p>See a healthcare provider if you have symptoms of chronic inflammation. They can determine the cause and develop a treatment plan, including medications and lifestyle modifications, to reduce inflammation and improve your health and well-being.</p>
