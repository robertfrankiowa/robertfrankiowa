I constantly find myself waking up in the middle of the night for water and I never realized how much of a difference mouth taping could make it could make when it came to dry mouth when sleeping. These were super comfortable to wear I could barely feel them when I slept.”—<em>Tasha Nicole Smith, beauty assistant</em></p><h2>Mouth Tape</h2><p>The "I" shape design of these patches is great for those who want minimal coverage but maximum results.

My husband should have gone to a sleep specialist because he probably needed a sleep apnea mask. For years he refused all help until he suffered with night time dry throat due to sleeping with his mouth open. We have recently been watching health YouTube videos and learned about the benefits of nose breathing. My husband decided to try Shhh Tape to help with his dry mouth. It only took him 2 nights to get use to the tape. He now sleeps peacefully through the night. And guess what? I do too!”</p><h2>What are the benefits of mouth taping?</h2><p>Though it may seem like a strange concept, mouth-taping is known to have many health benefits. Using tape to keep your mouth shut encourages you to breathe through your nose as you sleep; this can aid in many dental and sleep issues, such as dry mouth and bad breath. In more extreme cases, mouth breathing can affect your overall dental health. Dr. Mark Lowenberg says, “Putting tape over your mouth will prevent you from breathing from your mouth, and therefore, people who religiously sleep with mouth tape will see a reduction in the inflammation of their gum tissue.”</p><h2>What should I look for in when trying to find the best mouth tape for me?</h2><p>Comfort should be of the utmost importance when choosing a mouth tape. Because one of the primary benefits is helping you sleep through the night, finding one that feels good on your skin and lasts throughout the night is key. Comfort is also important to reduce any unnecessary tugging or pulling on your skin when you remove the tapes in the morning.</p><figure><img title="What should I look for in when trying to find the best mouth tape for me?" src="IMG/AAWegUO_what_should_i_look_for_in_when_trying_to_find_the_best_mouth_tape_for_me.jpg" alt="What should I look for in when trying to find the best mouth tape for me?"><figcaption><em>What should I look for in when trying to find the best mouth tape for me?.
