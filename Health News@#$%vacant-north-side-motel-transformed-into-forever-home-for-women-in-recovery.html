Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register</em></figcaption></figure><p>A longtime Des Moines nonprofit has opened a new facility aimed to house women in recovery and in need of continual support, services, safety and community. </p><p>The Beacon, which provides various programs such as counseling, career development and educational classes for women in crisis, recently launched The Beacon Village in Highland Park on Des Moines' north side. The 32-unit building comes as the nonprofit recognizes that consistent access to resources is crucial for people transitioning out of incarceration and addressing mental health and substance issues while trying to navigate everyday life. </p><p>"If you don't treat people with dignity, they cannot heal," Executive Director Melissa Vine said of her organization's overall mission as she showed the Des Moines Register around the new facility. "Dignity is what communicates to you that you have value. (It's) not based on your background. It's not based on what's happened to you, or what you've done as a result of what's happened to you. </p><p><strong><em>In the lead-up to the 2020 election, all eyes are on Iowa. Get updates of all things Iowa politics delivered to your inbox.</em></strong></p><p>"It's based solely on the fact that you have this unchanging intrinsic value simply because you are human, and we all have that same value." </p><p>Vine and staff last month joined members of FuseDSM for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the opening of The Village, a vacant motel on the city's north side that was converted into 32 efficiency units and is now home to more than 20 women. The building's units, which range in size and rent price, are one-room apartments that include a small kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living space. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Why open The Beacon Village?</h2><p>Vine said the idea for the Village came as she and staff saw women who graduated from their program still struggling to find their footing as they reentered their communities. </p><p>The Beacon, she says, offers a sober-living home in Sherman Hill for women in central Iowa who have just been arrested and possibly face charges. Instead of "sitting in jail" with no place to go, Vine said the 34-bed home equipped with trained trauma-informed staff is a viable option for those seeking support and access to resources. </p><p>Time spent in jail can result in losing housing, employment, personal belongings and children, she said. "Even if you're not convicted of a crime, how do you put your life back together?" </p><figure><img title="Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register" src="IMG/BB1pJJvr_vacant_north_side_motel_transformed_into_forever_home_for_women_in_recovery.jpg" alt="Vacant north side motel transformed into 'forever home' for women in recovery"><figcaption><em>Office Administrator Hana Boccella, left, and Executive Director Melissa Vine stand for a photo in the community room at The Beacon Village, Monday, July 8, 2024..

The city's lack of affordable housing made it hard for participants staying sober to find a decent place to live, and ones within their price range were in areas where they felt unsafe or were too far from the safety net they had built through the organization, she explained. </p><p>"What happens is they fall back into old patterns or maybe they find a place but feel really alone because they went from having this huge support system to 'I'm living on my own now,'" she said. </p><p>That's where The Beacon Village comes in. The additional sober-living home located at 1348 E. Euclid Ave. in Des Moines is designed as another stepping stone for program participants in need of more assistance. It's a "good landing spot" for women looking to "solidify" their recovery and work toward financial stability, Vine said. </p><p>"There's no pressure, you know," she said. "People can stay here as long as they need to, and for some people, this might become their forever home." </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What's it like living at The Beacon Village?</h2><p>The Beacon Village, formerly known as The Village Inn Motel, offers a total of 32 efficiency units, with apartments ranging from 240 square feet to 480 square feet. The nonprofit is currently renting the once-vacant property from Spire Construction, which completed the renovations, Vine said. Beacon leaders plan to later purchase the property to expand its services, she said. </p><p>The all-inclusive rent is a "good way" for tenants to "transition into having more responsibility," Vine said. At the Village, she added, women have more autonomy than at the sober-living home in Sherman Hill. </p><figure><img title="Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register" src="IMG/BB1pJH3e_vacant_north_side_motel_transformed_into_forever_home_for_women_in_recovery.jpg" alt="Vacant north side motel transformed into 'forever home' for women in recovery"><figcaption><em>The Beacon Village, a newly opened location of The Beacon, an organization that provides housing and programming for women who have experienced trauma., Monday, July 8, 2024.. Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the start of the tour, Vine stood in the middle of a room near lead case manager Alexandria Atal's office. Dubbed as a gathering space for residents and staff, big, comfy couches take over the room's corner. Tables offering seating for large groups are scattered all over. </p><p>Life-size portraits donated by Des Moines artist Mary Kline-Misol hang on the walls. A bookshelf leans against another, with a sign seeking donations for board games. </p><p>Outside the community room, near Atal's office is Hana Boccella's desk. Boccella, an office administrator, is among Beacon program graduates who are now working to help others begin their journey in recovery. A table near the building's entrance features flyers, pamphlets and other handouts. </p><p>Vine shared there are other amenities near The Beacon Village such as a grocery store, a local bank and bus stops. </p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">At The Beacon, women are given 'the first chance they never had'</h2><p>Applications to stay at The Beacon's sober-living home in Sherman Hill or the village are available online at thebeacondm.org. Referrals from community members and partners are also welcome, Vine said. </p><p>Those interested in volunteer opportunities or donating can also visit the nonprofit's website for more information. </p><p>Vine told the Register the women coming to The Beacon are smart, kind and resourceful and want an opportunity to change their lives. They are survivors of domestic violence or child sexual abuse, have experienced poverty or are cycling in and out of homelessness, courts or prison. </p><p>"We don't give women a second chance," she said. "We give them the first chance they never had." </p></main>
