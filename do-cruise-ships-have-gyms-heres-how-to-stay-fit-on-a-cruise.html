Even if you’re not super into working out, it’s a logical question when you consider how many other amenities are jam-packed onto modern vessels. The answer, of course, is yes, but that doesn’t mean you have to spend your entire vacation working up a sweat in order to stay healthy.<p>Fitness fiends are often quick to decry cruises because of the all-you-can-eat buffets, inclusive beverage packages and proliferation of opportunities to be sedentary. All this can make for a great vacation, but if you’re not careful, you could fall into some unhealthy patterns.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy a few daiquiris and complimentary soft-serve ice cream, but whether you’re on the ship for a few nights or months, staying active’s important. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to keep yourself healthy while you’re cruising, even if you never set foot in the gym.</p><p>Here’s how you can stay fit on your next voyage while minimizing the time you spend exercising — unless, of course, you’re really into fitness.</p><figure><img title="The Points Guy" src="IMG/AA1enRAT_apomaresgetty_images.jpg" alt="APOMARES/GETTY IMAGES"><figcaption><em>A cruise ship jogging track.

Although some of the biggest workout fanatics will spend time there daily, most people looking for a sweat session hit the gym on sea days. (Go at peak dining times if you’d like to avoid the crowds.)</p><p>You’ll often find a wide range of cardio machines, including treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes and rowers, as well as weight training machines (cable machines and a leg press) and free weights. You might also find high-intensity interval training equipment like kettlebells and medicine balls, plus some yoga mats, bands and foam rollers for stretching out those muscles.</p><p>Many cruise ships also offer fitness classes. Royal Caribbean, for example, offers yoga, Pilates and spinning classes on their ships. Carnival Cruise Line offers the same, plus boot camp classes. On Norwegian Cruise Line, you can also take a spin class or a high-intensity boxing class. These are often available for an additional fee.</p><p>The exception to the extra-fee class rule is Virgin Voyages, a relative newcomer to the industry. The line’s vessels offer all fitness classes at no charge, and the variety is both refreshing and fun. In addition to bungee classes, yoga and spin, passengers can choose from HIIT sessions, Muscle Beach-style workouts and even an ’80s aerobics class where themed attire is highly encouraged and Shake Weights are the apparatus of choice.</p><p>Many small-ship and upscale cruise lines also include group fitness classes in their fares.</p><figure><img title="The Points Guy" src="IMG/AA1enVJo_do_cruise_ships_have_gyms_heres_how_to_stay_fit_on_a_cruise.jpg" alt="Do cruise ships have gyms? Here’s how to stay fit on a cruise"><figcaption><em>The ’80s-themed VHS Workout class on Virgin Voyages’ Valiant Lady. ASHLEY KOSCIOLEK/THE POINTS GUY.

Take to the top deck for a run.</p><p>Every Royal Caribbean ship except Empress of the Seas has a running track. On Carnival cruises, you’ll find padded running tracks on nearly all of the vessels. If you’re looking for something a bit less mundane, check out Celebrity Cruises‘ Edge-class ships, which feature tracks that wind around the outer decks in a figure-eight that offers inclines and declines to keep things interesting. On Virgin’s vessels, the track is alone on the top deck, making it easier to burn calories without worrying that you’ll run into someone or trip over a deck chair.</p><p>Best of all, you don’t need to work out to stay fit during a cruise. All you have to do is skip the elevator. The largest passenger cruise ship on Earth, Royal Caribbean’s Wonder of the Seas, has 18 decks: If you walk up and down the stairs every day, you’ll be shocked how quickly you get in your steps during a cruise — even if you are on your way to the buffet.</p><h2>Watch what you eat</h2><figure><img title="The Points Guy" src="IMG/AA1dRDOp_msc_meraviglia_review_what_its_like_to_cruise_on_mscs_1st_new_york_based_ship.jpg" alt="MSC Meraviglia review: What it’s like to cruise on MSC’s 1st New York-based ship"><figcaption><em>The beet and burrata salad appetizer at a cruise ship steakhouse. ASHLEY KOSCIOLEK/THE POINTS GUY. The Points Guy</em></figcaption></figure><p>You might think it’s impossible to eat healthy on a cruise ship, but it’s pretty easy.</p><p>First, the dreaded buffet isn’t so bad. With ample salad bars, fresh soups and extensive fruit selections, the buffets offer plenty of options for selective travelers who wish to avoid the endless supply of French fries and mozzarella sticks. In the morning, breakfast buffets typically include a make-your-own omelet bar (request egg whites with vegetables and hold the cheese), hard-boiled eggs and more fruit.</p><p>When you’re at home, it might be difficult to find fresh or healthy foods, and they are often more expensive than their processed counterparts. But at a cruise ship buffet, making the healthy choice costs nothing.</p><p>In sit-down restaurants, cruise lines increasingly have a handful of healthful dishes on the menu, even if they’re not crowd-pleasers. Some vessels dedicate sections of restaurant menus to healthy fare. Cunard’s Queen Mary 2‘s Britannia restaurant, for example, offers spa cuisine items designed in partnership with Canyon Ranch.</p><figure><img title="The Points Guy" src="IMG/AA1eo7LW_do_cruise_ships_have_gyms_heres_how_to_stay_fit_on_a_cruise.jpg" alt="Do cruise ships have gyms? Here’s how to stay fit on a cruise"><figcaption><em>Fruit on a tray. KATHRYN ROMEYN/THE POINTS GUY.

Grab a seat at Celebrity’s complimentary Spa Cafe, now on most of the line’s vessels. Cruisers can order grilled chicken breast with steamed vegetables; a low-sodium arugula salad with grapefruit segments; and poached fruits with herbs and spices.</p><p>On some Princess Cruises vessels, cruisers can now elbow up to an Ocean Terrace Bar turning out raw, fresh-squeezed fruit and vegetable juices (for an upcharge). Even budget line Carnival has a Mongolian Wok restaurant on several of its ships. Tip: Skip the noodles and stick with fresh vegetables and lean proteins.</p><p>Lines have stepped up their game in the last few years with regard to dietary restrictions. Not only can you find more vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free menu items, but you can also look for desserts marked as sugar-free if you’re hoping to limit your intake of sweets.</p><p>Cruisers should also be mindful of those pesky liquid calories. We’re talking about alcohol, juice and soda — or tropical cocktails containing all three. Stick with red wine or straight liquor mixed with club soda instead, or try a NorCal Margarita: tequila, club soda, lemon or lime, salt and ice.</p><p>It might be tempting to grab a slice of cake or a frozen cocktail when they’re constantly available, but the key is to not go overboard. (See what I did there?)</p><h2>Book active excursions</h2><figure><img title="The Points Guy" src="IMG/AA1enTQE_do_cruise_ships_have_gyms_heres_how_to_stay_fit_on_a_cruise.jpg" alt="Do cruise ships have gyms? Here’s how to stay fit on a cruise"><figcaption><em>A woman sees the sights by bicycle in Rome. TFILM/GETTY IMAGES. The Points Guy</em></figcaption></figure><p>When the ship arrives at a port, you’ll want to disembark, stretch your legs and explore — not spend a day in the gym. And that’s good news because there are plenty of ways to get your steps on dry land.</p><p>Depending on where you’re cruising, you might have the opportunity to go cycling, hiking, snorkeling, scuba diving, paddleboarding or surfing. Take advantage of cruise ship shore excursions and find ways to be active while sightseeing. Even if you don’t book a walking tour in a major city, try to make active choices when possible. For example, did you know the average person can burn between 250 and 300 calories in an hour of snorkeling?</p><p>River cruise lines are also diving into the fitness fray. AmaWaterways has dedicated wellness hosts who lead active excursions ashore, as well as fitness classes on board (resistance band stretches, cardio dance). Last year, wellness hosts were available on all but three AmaWaterways vessels. They lead groups of cruisers on excursions such as bike rides along the Regensburg countryside or guided hikes up the Philosopher’s Path in Heidelberg.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>Cruises can be a great way to kick back and relax or explore multiple destinations without having to unpack multiple times — but that doesn’t mean you should completely toss away your fitness routine. Cruise lines have made it easy for passengers to hit the gym, take a fitness class or go for a run both on board and on dry land. So take advantage of the convenient exercise options, even for just a few minutes a day.</p><p><strong>Have more cruise questions?
