    <main><h1>Why do people snore? It could be a sign of a medical problem. Here's a look at the behavior.</h1><p>Snoring can be an annoying habit. Whether it’s your roommate, your partner or a houseguest, it’s easy to wonder how this involuntary sound can be so loud.</p><p>This behavior is not a new phenomenon. It has irked humanity for centuries, and objects such as leather muzzles, cannonballs sewn into soldiers’ uniforms and electrical shock machines have been used to try to prevent it, according to TED-Ed’s Alayna Vaughan.</p><p>Vaughan explains that most people will snore at some point in their lives, but chronic snoring can actually be a sign of a larger medical problem.</p><p><strong><em>Start the day smarter.

While we sleep, soft tissue in the respiratory tract relaxes, which narrows the airway, according to Vaughan. When the respiratory tract is narrower, the airflow must be stronger, which can cause our relaxed tissue to vibrate and make noise. </p><p>Issues that potentially create blockage of the airway such as sinus infections, nasal polyps and tonsillitis can exacerbate snoring, according to Yale Medicine.</p><p>Yale Medicine reports that snoring can be caused by any of the following conditions:</p><ul><li>Obesity or excess weight</li><li>Weak muscle in the throat and/or tongue</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Anatomical abnormalities such as a crooked nasal septum</li><li>Nasal obstruction due to allergies, sickness or polyps</li><li>Long palate or uvula</li><li>Sleeping on your back, which can cause the tongue to cover the back of your throat</li></ul><p>Chronic snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea, which Yale Medicine says is the biggest medical concern linked to snoring.</p><p><strong>Do you talk in your sleep? </strong>How to help you or a loved one.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What is sleep apnea?</h2><p>Sleep apnea is a condition that causes people to periodically stop breathing while asleep, according to Yale Medicine.</p><p>There are two types of sleep apnea — central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea, says Vaughan. Central sleep apnea causes the brain to occasionally fail to regulate breathing, though snoring is less common with this type of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea, which is caused by blockages in the airway, is more common, according to the Mayo Clinic. If you have both kinds of sleep apnea, it is known as complex sleep apnea, according to Vaughan. </p><p>In addition to potential fatigue resulting from poor sleep quality, obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke and an abnormal heartbeat, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>A doctor might recommend a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine to treat sleep apnea and/or eliminate snoring, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p><strong>Why do people sleepwalk? </strong>The details you need to know and how to address it in your life</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Just Curious for more?
