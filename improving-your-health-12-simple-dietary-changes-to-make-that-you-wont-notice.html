    <main><h1>Improving Your Health: 12 Simple Dietary Changes to Make That You Won’t Notice</h1><p>Improving your health doesn’t mean you have to give up all the foods you love or workout every day of the week. You can make big improvements to your health over time by making simple changes. Here are 12 simple dietary changes you can make that you won’t notice, but your body will! </p><h2>Eat From Smaller Plates</h2><p>Changing the size of your plates can help you to reduce your portion sizes. Large plates make small portions look even smaller, while small plates can make your portion sizes look larger. When you eat from a smaller plate your brain thinks that you are eating more than you are making you less likely to overeat. </p><h2>Eat More Vegetables</h2><p>Changing your diet for the better isn’t just about what you cut back on or cut out, you also need to add in healthier foods. Vegetables are full of fiber, vitamins, and nutrients that your body needs, and they are low in calories. Including more vegetables in your recipes and on your plate is a small change that can have a big impact. </p><h2>Include Protein in Every Meal</h2><p>Protein helps you to retain muscle mass and burn calories. It also gives you energy, helps to keep you feeling full for longer, and reduces cravings. Include a source of protein in all of your meals and snacks. </p><figure><img title="Include Protein in Every Meal" src="IMG/BB1kqvbm_include_protein_in_every_meal.jpg" alt="Include Protein in Every Meal"><figcaption><em>Include Protein in Every Meal.

If you are craving the carbonation from your favorite sodas, try sparkling water as a replacement. You will still get the great taste and bubbly sensation without the excess calories. Fruit makes a great substitute for those with a sweet tooth.</p><h2>Replace Refined Grains With Whole Grains</h2><p>You don’t need to cut out the carbohydrates completely, but you should replace refined grains like white bread and regular pasta with their whole-grain counterparts. Whole grains have been linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease and are full of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. </p><figure><img title="Replace Refined Grains With Whole Grains" src="IMG/BB1kqvbt_replace_refined_grains_with_whole_grains.jpg" alt="Replace Refined Grains With Whole Grains"><figcaption><em>Replace Refined Grains With Whole Grains.

If you keep your dressing on the side, you can control how much you use and may even use much less than you would otherwise.</p><h2>Drink More Water</h2><p>Drinking plenty of water ensures that you stay well hydrated, which will improve your overall health. It can also increase weight loss and promote weight maintenance. Additionally, having a glass of water before eating a meal can prevent overeating. </p><h2>Move to Heart Healthy Oils</h2><p>Processed oils like sunflower, canola, vegetable, and soybean oils are a staple in many kitchens, but they are high in omega-6 fatty acids and low in healthier omega-3 fatty acids. Swap these oils for healthier alternatives like avocado, coconut, or extra virgin olive oil. These oils contain a higher concentration of omega-3s which are better for your heart health</p><h2>Drink Your Coffee Black</h2><p>Coffee has many health benefits, like lowering your risk of type 2 diabetes and liver disease, but these benefits are lessened with the addition of creamers and sweeteners. If you normally drink your coffee with cream and sugar, try slowly reducing the amount until you can drink it black. This is a simple way to cut some empty calories from your diet.</p><h2>Eat Your Greens First</h2><p>Eat your greens when you first start your meal. This way, you won’t get full before you finish them, and you may eat a smaller portion of less healthy foods on your plate. Eating greens and vegetables before a carb-rich food can help keep blood sugar levels steady. </p><h2>Choose Leaner Meats</h2><p>Meat is an excellent source of protein, but some types and cuts of meat are better for you than others. Lean meats are not high in fat and still have plenty of protein and flavor. Examples include chicken, turkey, bison, and fish. </p><figure><img title="Choose Leaner Meats" src="IMG/BB1kqzme_choose_leaner_meats.jpg" alt="Choose Leaner Meats"><figcaption><em>Choose Leaner Meats.

Swap out chips or sweets for healthier alternatives like nuts, seeds, or fruit. These provide essential nutrients and satisfy hunger without the empty calories.</p><figure><img title="Snack Smartly" src="IMG/BB1kqvbM_snack_smartly.jpg" alt="Snack Smartly"><figcaption><em>Snack Smartly.
