Provided by The Manual</em></figcaption></figure><p>Calisthenic workouts use your body weight as resistance, requiring little to no equipment. This means that you can exercise from the comfort of your home, while traveling, or outdoors. Whether you have heard about this exercise form before or are hearing about it for the first time but do not know what it entails, chances are you have already seen it in action.</p><p>Besides the fact that you can avoid gym fees by doing calisthenics, it also has other benefits that make it an excellent addition to your fitness routine. So, if you are looking to try it out, this 28 day calisthenics challenge guide is a great start, as we will explore a range of information, including the benefits, equipment needed, and even tips to help you get the best results. </p><h2><strong>What are the benefits of calisthenics?</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Manual" src="IMG/BB1iE762_cant_do_pull_ups_you_need_this_simple_addition_to_your_workout_routine.jpg" alt="Can’t do pull ups? You need this simple addition to your workout routine"><figcaption><em>Yaroslav Shuraev / Pexels. Provided by The Manual</em></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Requires little to no equipment</strong></h3><p>The best part of the calisthenics exercise is that you can do it anywhere. It does not require several pieces of equipment; most times, all you need is yourself. You do not need to spend money on gym memberships or setting up pricey gym equipment. </p><h3><strong>Improves brain-body connection</strong></h3><p>Calisthenics training requires your brain to work just as hard as your body and for them to be in sync as well. Regularly practicing calisthenics can help you develop fine motor skills, which can improve coordination, power, speed, strength, stamina, flexibility, and agility. </p><h3><strong>Helps you build strength effectively</strong></h3><p>It is not out of place to wonder how to build strength without equipment like dumbbells and resistance bands. However, calisthenics can help you effectively build strength from your body weight alone. </p><p>For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, doing a bodyweight pull-up means you are automatically lifting 200 pounds. You might not even be able to do 200 pounds on a lat pulldown, but many people find it easier because your brain can tolerate your body weight better, and the task can be less intimidating. </p><h3><strong>Gentler on joints</strong></h3><p>Most times, resistance training, when done incorrectly, can put too much strain on certain joints and soft tissues. Lifting too heavy of weights can create an imbalance and cause problems for your joints, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. But with calisthenics, your body is already used to carrying its own weight; it develops strength and size according to your muscular system, and the movements are natural to your body. Because of this, injuries from calisthenics tend to be few and far between.</p><h2><strong>What equipment do you need for this calisthenics challenge?</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Manual" src="IMG/BB1m6h8C_man_using_a_jump_rope.jpg" alt="Man using a jump rope."><figcaption><em>Pavel Danilyuk / Pexels.

We recommend you have access to at least some of the following equipment:</p><ul> <li>Dip bar</li> <li>Liquid chalk</li> <li>Mini parallettes</li> <li>Yoga mat</li> <li>A foam roller</li> <li>Door frame pull-up bar</li> <li>Weight belt or dip belt</li> <li>Jump rope</li> <li>Weight vest</li> <li>Calisthenics gloves</li> </ul><h2><strong>28-day calisthenics challenge</strong></h2><figure><img title="Provided by The Manual" src="IMG/BB1m6lYf_a_man_doing_sumo_squats_in_a_park.jpg" alt="A man doing sumo squats in a park"><figcaption><em>Costantino Costa / Alamy.

This is coupled with the fact that it is a home-based program that does not require gym equipment or memberships, so many can save money while exercising comfortably in their homes or outdoors. </p><p>This calisthenics challenge aims to enhance mobility, strength, and functional fitness. The workout sessions do not exceed 30 minutes, so they can be incorporated into any schedule, no matter how busy you are. </p><p>More importantly, the workout routine is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels, so this guide covers a complete seven-day routine that you will repeat for four weeks or 28 days.</p><p>After each set, ensure that you take a short break before starting another set. Also, take short breaks between each exercise. </p><p>Day one to day six has five exercises each, and day seven is mainly for stretching to help prevent burnout, allow your muscles to repair, and ease pain.
