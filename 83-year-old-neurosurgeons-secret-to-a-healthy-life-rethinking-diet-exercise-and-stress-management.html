His fitness surpasses that of many people half his age who grumble about body aches. So how has he managed to stay so fit and healthy despite his age? It's a blend of physical and mental conditioning.</p></strong><h2>Dr. Joseph Maroon shares his formula for everlasting youth</h2><p>In his forties, Dr Maroon suffered the loss of his father, which triggered a significant nervous breakdown. The tragedy left him in a state of despair, feeling that his life had lost meaning. In search of a distraction, he turned towards sports and found a whole new passion for life. <strong>Physical activity served as the catalyst for change.</strong> He began with a diet overhaul and after numerous trials, found that the <strong>Mediterranean diet</strong>, rich in essential nutrients, suited him best.</p><p>A sound diet provided the energy necessary for his <strong>increased physical activity</strong>. According to Dr. Maroon, while running is an excellent sport, he equally encourages other forms of activity such as walking or dancing. Regular exercise—the minimum being an hour a day—is vital. Another critical life component is to <strong>eliminate harmful habits</strong>. Substance use such as smoking and alcohol consumption are detrimental to health and can lead to numerous severe diseases, mental health issues included.</p><h2>Manage stress and embrace life to the fullest</h2><p>One major factor that greatly influences our well-being is <strong>stress</strong>. While stress is unavoidable, it is important to make decisions that can help to reduce it in our lives. If your job or relationship causes you constant angst, reconsider the value and worth it adds to your life. <strong>Start practicing meditation</strong> and embark on a journey of self-discovery. <strong>Don't hesitate to seek psychological help</strong>; sometimes, a conversation with another person can fundamentally change your perspective, fostering a sense of inner peace.</p><p>Lastly, remember to pay attention to your sleep. <strong>Maintaining proper sleep hygiene</strong> is crucial. Do you allocate enough time for recovery? Since we all have the same number of hours in a day, it's imperative to set aside seven to eight hours for rest to allow your body time to decompress after a taxing day. Neglecting sleep can lead to a variety of health issues, including circulatory and respiratory diseases, and even contributes to obesity.</p><p><b>Read also:</b></p><p>A 17-year-old married a 71-year-old. 8 years later they are still together</p><p>Ashley Harkleroad: From Wimbleton to adult sites.
