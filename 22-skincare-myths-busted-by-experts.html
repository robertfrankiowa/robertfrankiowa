    <main><h1>22 Skincare Myths Busted by Experts</h1><p>Navigating the world of skincare is challenging, with myths and misconceptions at every turn. This article debunks 22 common skincare myths, guided by expert insights. It aims to clarify misconceptions, from SPF usage to moisturization needs, providing readers with scientifically backed advice for optimal skin health.</p><h2>Myth: Higher SPF provides complete sun protection</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> SPF (Sun Protection Factor) measures protection against UVB rays only. No sunscreen can block 100% of UV rays. SPF 30 blocks about 97% of UVB rays, and SPF 50 blocks 98%. It’s crucial to reapply every two hours and use broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect against both UVA and UVB rays.</p><h2>Myth: Oily skin doesnât need moisturizer</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Oily skin still needs hydration. Skipping moisturizer can cause skin to overproduce oil to compensate for dryness. Lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizers can hydrate skin without adding excess oil.</p><h2>Myth: You donât need sunscreen on cloudy days</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds, so sun protection is necessary every day, regardless of cloud cover. UVA rays, which contribute to aging and cancer, are present year-round.</p><h2>Myth: Expensive skincare products are always better</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Price does not necessarily correlate with effectiveness. Many affordable products contain effective ingredients similar to high-end products. Itâs more important to look for scientifically backed ingredients suitable for your skin type.</p><h2>Myth: More exfoliation leads to clearer skin</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Over-exfoliation can damage the skin barrier, leading to irritation, sensitivity, and breakouts. Gentle exfoliation 1-2 times a week is sufficient for most skin types.</p><h2>Myth: Makeup causes acne</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Non-comedogenic makeup does not cause acne. Acne is caused by a combination of factors, and proper removal of makeup and skin cleansing can prevent breakouts.</p><h2>Myth: Toothpaste is a good treatment for pimples</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Toothpaste can irritate and dry out the skin, leading to more harm than good. Itâs better to use products specifically formulated for acne treatment.</p><h2>Myth: Scrubbing your face harder will clean better</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Over-scrubbing can damage the skin’s barrier and cause irritation. Gentle cleansing is sufficient to remove dirt and excess oil without harming the skin.</p><h2>Myth: Pores open and close with hot and cold water</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Pore size is genetic and pores do not open or close. Hot water can loosen dirt and oil, while cold water can reduce swelling, but the pore structure remains constant.</p><h2>Myth: Only sun exposure causes skin aging</h2><p> <strong>Reality:</strong> Sun exposure is a major factor, but not the only one. Other factors like genetics, pollution, smoking, and diet also play significant roles in skin aging.</p><h2>Myth: Acne only affects teenagers</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Acne can occur at any age due to hormonal changes, stress, diet, and other factors. Adult acne is common and requires tailored treatment.</p><figure><img title="Myth: Acne only affects teenagers" src="IMG/AA1no9OM_myth_acne_only_affects_teenagers.jpg" alt="Myth: Acne only affects teenagers"><figcaption><em>Myth: Acne only affects teenagers.

Using broad-spectrum sunscreen is the best way to protect against sunburn and long-term damage.</p><figure><img title="Myth: A base tan protects against sunburn" src="IMG/AA1noeBe_myth_a_base_tan_protects_against_sunburn.jpg" alt="Myth: A base tan protects against sunburn"><figcaption><em>Myth: A base tan protects against sunburn.

	</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Myth: If skincare products sting or burn, they are working</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Stinging or burning sensations can indicate skin irritation or allergic reaction, not effectiveness. Products should not cause discomfort.</p><h2>Myth: You only need to apply sunscreen in the morning</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Sunscreen needs to be reapplied every two hours, or more often if sweating or swimming, to maintain effective protection against UV rays.</p><h2>Myth: Skin detoxes are necessary to clear toxins</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The skin, liver, and kidneys naturally eliminate toxins from the body. “Detoxing” skin products offer no additional benefit and can sometimes harm the skin.</p><figure><img title="Myth: Skin detoxes are necessary to clear toxins" src="IMG/AA1nohmq_myth_skin_detoxes_are_necessary_to_clear_toxins.jpg" alt="Myth: Skin detoxes are necessary to clear toxins"><figcaption><em>Myth: Skin detoxes are necessary to clear toxins.

	</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Myth: You should switch skincare products frequently for effectiveness</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Consistency is key in skincare. Frequently changing products doesn’t give your skin enough time to adjust and can lead to irritation. Unless a product causes adverse reactions or you are adjusting to your aging skin’s needs, it’s beneficial to stick with a routine that works for you.</p><figure><img title="Myth: You should switch skincare products frequently for effectiveness" src="IMG/AA1nolvB_myth_you_should_switch_skincare_products_frequently_for_effectiveness.jpg" alt="Myth: You should switch skincare products frequently for effectiveness"><figcaption><em>Myth: You should switch skincare products frequently for effectiveness.

	</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Myth: Chocolate and greasy foods cause acne</h2><p><strong>Reality:</strong> While diet can affect skin health, there’s no definitive link between chocolate or greasy food and acne. Acne is primarily influenced by genetics, hormones, and bacteria. However, a balanced diet high in antioxidants and low in sugar can promote healthier skin.</p></main>
