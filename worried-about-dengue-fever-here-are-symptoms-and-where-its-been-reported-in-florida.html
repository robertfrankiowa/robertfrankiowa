Here are symptoms and where it's been reported in Florida</h1><p>Dengue fever has been reported in Florida.</p><p>The mosquito-borne disease has been found in a few people who acquired it in Florida and in several others who got it during travels to countries where the disease is more common. </p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, there have been at least six cases of locally transmitted dengue in Florida so far in 2024, with the latest occurring in Hillsborough County on Florida's West Coast. </p><p>Another 172 cases in Florida were travel related.</p><p>While most dengue cases reported in the 49 continental US states occur in travelers who visited areas with risk of dengue, limited local spread of dengue has been reported in Florida, Hawaii, Texas, Arizona, and California, the CDC said.</p><p>The majority of the dengue cases acquired in Florida were in Miami-Dade County, where six cases have been reported so far this year, according to the Florida Department of Health.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What is dengue fever?</h2><figure><img title="PHOTO PROVIDED BY FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH" src="IMG/BB1oOcH0_people_are_infected_with_dengue_through_the_bite_of_certain_species_of_mosquitoes_primarily_aedes_aegypti.jpg" alt="People are infected with dengue through the bite of certain species of mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti (pictured here) and Aedes albopictus."><figcaption><em>People are infected with dengue through the bite of certain species of mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti (pictured here) and Aedes albopictus..

Epidemics occur yearly in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australia."</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Is there dengue fever in Florida?</h2><p>Yes. The disease not only has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe, but also to southern parts of the United States, both the CDC and Mayo Clinic reported.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms of dengue fever?</h2><figure><img title="GRAPHIC PROVIDED BY CDC" src="IMG/BB1oOcH6_this_florida_county_reports_latest_case_of_dengue_fever_heres_what_to_know.jpg" alt="This Florida county reports latest case of dengue fever. Here's what to know"><figcaption><em>Dengue symptoms.. GRAPHIC PROVIDED BY CDC</em></figcaption></figure><p>The most common dengue symptom is a high fever of 104 degrees, and any of the following signs: </p><ul><li>Headache</li><li>Muscle, bone or joint pain</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Rash</li><li>Pain behind the eyes</li><li>Swollen glands</li></ul><p>Mild symptoms of dengue can be confused with other illnesses that cause fever, the CDC said.</p><p>Symptoms of dengue typically last two to seven days.</p><p>Most people will recover after about a week.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">When to seek emergency help</h2><p>Severe dengue is a medical emergency, the CDC said. Warning signs usually begin in the 24 to 48 hours after your fever has gone away.</p><p>"About 1 in 20 people who get sick with dengue will develop severe dengue. Severe dengue can result in shock, internal bleeding, and death." A blood test is the only way to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>"Untreated severe dengue fever may have a mortality rate of 10% to 20%. However, with appropriate supportive care, the mortality rate can be reduced to approximately 1%," the National Library of Medicine said.</p><p>Go to a local clinic or emergency room if you have any of the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>Belly pain or tenderness</li><li>Vomiting (at least three times in 24 hours)</li><li>Bleeding from the nose or gums</li><li>Vomiting blood, or blood in the stool</li><li>Feeling extremely tired or restless</li></ul><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">How does dengue fever spread?</h2><p>The dengue virus spreads from person to person through the bite from an infected <em>Aedes aegypti</em> or <em>Aedes albopictus</em> mosquito.</p><p>After a female mosquito bites a person infected with the dengue virus, there's an incubation period of 8 to 12 days. After that time, the mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of their one-month life span, the CDC said.</p><h2 class="presto-h2 wp-block-heading">Are there other names for dengue fever?</h2><p>Dengue fever is also known as breakbone or seven-day fever. </p><p>Both terms describe some of the symptoms suffered by those with the disease, including intense muscle spasms, joint pain, and high fever, according to the National Library of Medicine.</p></main>
