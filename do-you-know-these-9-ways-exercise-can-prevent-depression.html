When it strikes, depression can make everyday life feel unbearable and even impossible. While there are many effective treatments for depression, as a primary prevention strategy for depression, exercise has proven to be very effective. This article outlines 9 ways exercise helps prevent depression.</p><h2>1. It Helps You Sleep Better</h2><p>A good night’s sleep is vital to your overall health and well-being, but not everyone can get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you’re having trouble falling asleep or wake up feeling exhausted, exercise may be just what you need to help you get a good night’s rest.</p><p>How does exercise help promote better sleep? Exercise has been shown to increase the amount of deep sleep you get each night, which is the most beneficial type of restorative sleep. Deep sleep helps your brain process information, release chemicals that regulate mood and emotions, and repair tissues.</p><p>Exercise also helps reduce stress levels by increasing blood flow and stimulating endorphins—the brain chemicals that make us feel happy. It’s also been shown that people who exercise regularly tend to have fewer restless nights than those who don’t have regular exercise routines.</p><h2>2. It Improves Your Concentration and Focus</h2><p>Studies have shown that regular exercise can increase your ability to concentrate and focus by boosting your brain’s blood flow and oxygen levels, which helps you stay alert. It also reduces stress, which can be a significant distraction that triggers negative thoughts that can lead to depression.</p><p>High-intensity cardio, such as running or cycling, is the most effective exercise for improving concentration and focus. This type of exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, chemicals in your brain that make you feel good and help you relax.</p><p>You can also try yoga or other low-impact exercise like swimming or hiking if you don’t want to strain your joints or muscles too much. Low-impact exercises may not give you the same mental benefits as high-intensity cardio, but they still help reduce stress levels and improve overall health!</p><h2>3. It Boosts Your Self-Esteem</h2><p>Exercise also has a huge impact on self-esteem. When you exercise regularly, you will start to see results in your body, which will make you feel better about yourself. The trick is finding forms of exercise you enjoy and want to stick with long term.</p><p>Though you’re likely to see some quick results, regular fitness eventually leads to a plateau, but you don’t want to lose all your progress. So, if you find an exercise you enjoy, you will retain the enjoyment and confidence in knowing you’ve done something good for yourself.</p><h2>4. It Keeps Your Brain Young and Healthy.</h2><p>While it’s true that aging affects all of the body’s organs, one of the most noticeable changes is in the brain. As we age, our brains shrink and lose neurons, leading to memory loss, confusion, and disease.</p><p>However, exercise has been shown to help prevent these effects. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh found that older people who exercised regularly had greater volume in their hippocampi—the part of the brain involved in memory storage and retrieval—than their sedentary peers. A study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that walking just three times per week was linked with improved cognitive function among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p><h2>5. It Reduces Stress and Anxiety.</h2><p>Exercise can help you burn off steam. Who doesn’t need a way to reduce stress and anxiety, especially if you have a busy schedule? The most important thing to remember is that you should start slowly, exercising regularly for at least 15 minutes a day.</p><p>To get started, try walking or swimming. These activities are low-impact and easy to do at home or the gym. They will help acclimate your body to physical activity and set the foundation for injury prevention as you increase intensity. If walking is too boring, consider joining a gym so that you have more options for exercise equipment and potentially personal training programs.</p><p>If you enjoy exercise, add some strength training by lifting weights or doing squats with free weights at home or at the gym. This will help build muscle mass, allowing your body to burn fat more efficiently, making it easier for your body to lose weight over time, and increase your energy levels!</p><h2>6. It Builds Resilience to Cope With Stressors in Life</h2><p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology shows that regular physical activity can help build resilience to cope with stressors. The researchers found that people who engaged in regular physical activity were better able to cope with stressful situations than those who did not exercise regularly. They also discovered that this effect was more substantial among people who had a history of anxiety or depression than those without such histories.</p><p>While this study does not show a causal relationship between exercise and resilience, it does suggest an association between them. It provides some insight into how this process might work. It also highlights an area where more research should be conducted so that we can better understand how our bodies respond to stressors and how we can learn how to manage those responses effectively.</p><h2>7. It Boosts Your Sense of Well-Being</h2><p>Exercise is the best medicine for the mind and body. It can improve our mood, reduce stress, and make us feel happier. It can also promote a feeling of well-being.</p><p>Exercise also improves our well-being by increasing the production of endorphins, neurotransmitters that help you feel good. Exercise also helps to reduce levels of cortisol, which is a stress hormone that can lead to depression, anxiety, and unwanted belly fat.</p><h2>8. It Helps You Lose Weight—and Keep It Off!</h2><p>Exercise may be the best way to lose weight. It’s also a great way to help prevent or manage diabetes and high blood pressure, lower heart disease risk, improve mood, and reduce stress. And if you have depression, exercise is one of the most effective low-cost treatments available.</p><p>Exercise helps you lose weight by increasing your metabolism, which is how your body burns calories. The more intense your workout is, the higher your metabolism will be after exercising.</p><h2>9. It Promotes a Stronger Immune System</h2><p>Exercise is a powerful tool for improving physical and mental health, but it also positively affects the immune system. Studies have shown that regular exercise can lower your risk of developing 13 different types of cancer.</p><p>This also boosts the production of cytokines, which are proteins that help fight off infections and diseases. These cytokines also play a role in regulating inflammation throughout the body. People who exercise regularly tend to have stronger immune systems than those who don’t get enough physical activity regularly — even when exposed to pathogens such as viruses or bacteria.</p><h2>Strengthening Your Defenses Against Depression Literally</h2><p>Exercise is just one part of a broader set of habits for good mental health, but it can make a difference. In fact, amid a depressive episode, any physical activity will help bring you out of it. But regular exercise can do so much more. It can help prevent depression and strengthen your body to decrease your risk of developing various illnesses.</p><p>Though it may be the least appealing thing to do, taking action and moving your body, even just by practicing deep breathing or walking, could be the spark that leads to better feelings and brighter days. </p></main>
