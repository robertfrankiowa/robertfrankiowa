And as it turns out, research suggests it can also improve your physical and mental health in significant ways.</p><p>Feeling thankful may come more naturally in certain instances. Think: the feel-good emotions that arise when you open a gift from someone you care about or see the look on a friend’s face when you make their favorite dish. At other times, especially when we’re feeling stressed, gratitude may not come as easily. But making the intentional choice to focus on gratitude can actually be beneficial to you and those around you. </p><p>Here we take a closer look at the research, hear from experts about their professional perspectives on gratitude, and share their suggestions on ways to easily incorporate gratitude practices into everyday life for better overall health.</p><h2>How Is Gratitude Linked to Better Health?</h2><p>According to Greg Hammer, M.D., a Stanford professor who focuses on wellness and mindfulness—and confirmed by research—gratitude practices directly help to combat stress.</p><p>Acute stress can bring on a temporary increase in blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar—all things that help your body react to the stress at hand. “Acute stress was historically most often triggered by physical danger, like the appearance of a predator,” Hammer explains. “Nowadays, however, this acute stress response is often initiated simply by thoughts—of how much work we have to do, possible loss of our job or a conflict at home.” </p><p>It’s not possible to completely avoid daily stressors, and thankfully this acute stress is not necessarily harmful, as long as we allow it to subside quickly, says Hammer. “Otherwise, acute stress turns into chronic stress, causing chronically elevated heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar, predisposing us to hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes and even dementia.”</p><p>Stress and its negative impact on the body has long been researched. According to a 2021 study published in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, negative emotions stemming from stress may be linked to increased blood pressure and heart rate. Data supports the same sentiments about stress and its connection to increased blood sugar levels, per a 2022 review published in <em>Cureus</em>. To reduce stress and its adverse side effects, Hammer states that implementing gratitude in your daily routine is worth the try. </p><p>“Noticing gratitude when we are experiencing stress activates the vagus nerve and parasympathetic nervous system, slowing our heart rate as well as lowering our blood pressure and blood sugar levels,” Hammer continues. “This brings our physiology back into homeostasis and good physical health, diminishing or even preventing the harmful effects of chronic stress.”</p><h2>4 Ways to Incorporate Gratitude in Your Life for Better Health</h2><p>So, where to get started? Florence Ann Romano, who specializes in helping people with personal growth, and Dravon James, Pharm.D., a motivational speaker and life coach, share some simple ways you can embrace gratitude every day.</p><h3>1. Try a Meditation Practice</h3><p>To help relax the mind and relieve stress in the body, Romano notes that meditation may help. Meditation can happen in a number of ways. It could be as simple as engaging in a breathing technique for as little as one minute, attending a meditation class or perhaps trying out a guided meditation walk. If you're feeling unsure of where to start, try downloading a free meditation app on your smartphone, and scroll through the offerings. </p><p>Prioritizing gratitude for your own well-being can inherently end up benefiting the people around you, too. “Get yourself in the right mindset for all that is to come, and be intentional about how you are going to be a ripple effect of empathy for others,” Romano says.</p><h3>2. Start Your Day with Affirmations</h3><p>Daily affirmations aren’t just a fad; this practice can be a great way to improve your mindset for the day to come, James notes.</p><p>“A simple yet effective way to center gratitude in our daily routine is to start each day with an</p><p>intentional gratitude practice,” James explains. “First thing every morning, before you get out of bed, smile and say out loud three things that you are grateful for. If you can write those three gratitude affirmations on an index card and carry it with you throughout the day, even better.”</p><h3>3. Write a Handwritten Note or Text to Someone You Love</h3><p>Take out your phone or notepad: Romano recommends sending a message to a family member or friend and letting them know what they mean to you. Even something as simple as “I’m thinking of you!” can turn someone’s day around. </p><p>“They will surely smile,” she says, just as you would if you yourself received a thoughtful message. Plus, it may inspire someone close to you to express gratitude in their own life.</p><p>Volunteering is an important part of supporting the communities you’re in. But it can also help you practice gratitude outside of your own life. Things like monetary donations to a charity, gathering nonperishable goods for a food bank or volunteering your time at a local soup kitchen or shelter are all ways to make a difference.</p><p>“Allow giving back to show you what is happening in the world outside of your world,” Romano says. “This will ground you in gratitude.”</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Gratitude is the practice of showing gratefulness and appreciation to those that surround you. Implementing gratitude can improve both your physical and mental health—and the health of the people in your life. Try the tips suggested by experts to start embracing gratitude, whether by trying meditation, volunteering in your community or finding your own ways to incorporate gratitude into your everyday life.</p></main>
