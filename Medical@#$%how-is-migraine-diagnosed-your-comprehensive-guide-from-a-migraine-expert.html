Have you been diagnosed with sinus headaches, tension headaches, or allergies but suspect you might have migraine? This guide will help you prepare to talk to your provider about getting a migraine diagnosis.</p><h2>How Is Migraine Diagnosed?</h2><p>Migraine is a disease that is characterized by attacks or episodes. Individual attacks may themselves be diagnosed as migraine, and referred to as “migraine attacks,” but to receive a formal diagnosis of migraine disease requires at least five attacks.</p><p>A migraine diagnosis is a clinical diagnosis, meaning it is made based upon characteristics rather than any specific tests, scans, or biomarkers.</p><p>At least five episodes lasting 4 to 72 hours that include at least one of the following:</p><ul>  <li>Nausea and/or vomiting</li>  <li>Photophobia (light sensitivity)</li>  <li>Phonophobia (noise sensitivity)</li>  <li>Head pain with at least two of these characteristics:</li> </ul><ul>  <li>Unilateral location (occurring on only one side)</li>  <li>Pulsating quality</li>  <li>At least moderate severity</li>  <li>Aggravated by routine physical activity</li> </ul><h2>Migraine and Genetics: It's All in the Family</h2><p>These criteria are important to ensure that clinicians and researchers are speaking the same language. But there are some problems with focusing on those criteria, especially the features of pain.</p><p>First of all, you can have migraine attacks without headache, which is diagnosed as migraine aura without headache. While with migraine it is typical to have a headache that is at least moderate in severity, there are some individuals, particularly older individuals, who have only a very mild headache associated with the attack. </p><p>There is also an issue around unilateral (one-sided) headache. Many patients with migraine — maybe even a majority — have headache on both sides of their head. They may start with unilateral pain, but it ends up spreading to involve both sides of the head.</p><h2>Should I Track My Symptoms and Triggers in Order to Get an Appropriate Migraine Diagnosis?</h2><p>Yes, keeping a headache diary can be helpful. The particular things a practitioner is interested in to make a diagnosis of migraine are nausea and sensory sensitivity, like sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch.</p><p>The timing of pain or symptoms is also important to include in the headache diary because that is another important factor in distinguishing migraine from something like cluster headache or other types of primary headache. It’s important to know not just how many days or on what days you have symptoms, but also how long it lasts when you have pain or when you have symptoms. Those are the most important things for us to record: the timing, the associated sensory sensitivity, and nausea. Then you can also track any other prominent symptoms you have, like dizziness.</p><p>It can be useful to track these symptoms prior to an appointment with a healthcare provider in order to receive an accurate diagnosis. But, after receiving a migraine diagnosis, it may not be necessary to track all of these symptoms. It may be sufficient to simply track the frequency of headache/associated symptom days, treatments used and whether they helped, and the impact on function at home or work.</p><h3>The Traffic Light System: Another Way to Track Migraine Symptoms</h3><p>Patients rank their day as green, yellow, or red.</p><ul>  <li>“Green” is a day when migraine symptoms are mild and don't slow you down.</li>  <li>“Yellow” is a day when migraine symptoms slowed you down. </li>  <li>“Red” is a day when migraine symptoms stopped you from regular functioning.</li> </ul><p>The goal of this traffic light system is to help patients identify when to treat their migraine attacks. The earlier attacks are treated, the more likely medication will be effective. </p><h2>Is There a Blood Test for Migraine Triggers?</h2><p>No, there is not. And, if you’re wondering “Can blood tests detect migraine?”— the answer is no, as well. There is no blood test of any kind that is helpful for diagnosing migraine or identifying triggers, and that includes blood tests for genetic testing. Unfortunately, we still don’t have any specific genes that we can measure that indicate that someone has migraine except for certain rare types of the disease, like hemiplegic migraine. Apart from that, for the overwhelming majority of patients, there are simply no blood tests that can help diagnose migraine. </p><p>Having said that, there may be circumstances where providers order blood tests to look for other medical conditions that may be exacerbating migraine, such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, or autoimmune conditions like lupus. In terms of migraine diagnosis, however, there is simply no blood test (yet) that is helpful.</p><h1>ID-Headache: A Simple Quiz You Can Use to Self-Diagnose Your Symptoms</h1><p>Use this straightforward quiz to help you diagnose your symptoms. Select yes or no to the following three questions to help determine if you're experiencing migraine attacks. </p><p>Always consult a healthcare provider with any questions or concerns.</p><h2>What Doctor Should I See for Headache Pain and Diagnosis?</h2><p>Ideally, any provider in a healthcare setting can make a diagnosis of migraine, because it is not difficult to diagnose. It is a disservice to think that only headache specialists or neurologists can diagnose migraine, because it is one of the most common disorders on the planet. There are not enough neurologists, let alone headache specialists, to appropriately diagnose and treat every person with migraine. Migraine diagnoses should be made much more routinely in the primary care setting.</p><p>In addition to physicians, advanced practice providers like physician assistants and nurse practitioners are becoming increasingly engaged in the headache medicine community and they may be capable of diagnosing and managing migraine. They are one of the fastest-growing segments of, for example, the American Headache Society, which is really encouraging because they are in a position to make the diagnosis in the primary care setting, as well.</p><h2>Are There Tests for Migraine?</h2><p>The simple answer is: no. Research is looking for specific patterns of brain structure and function that are diagnostic of migraine. At this stage, however, we don’t have any tests or scans that will reliably diagnose migraine.</p><h3>Will There Be Neurological Tests to Rule Out Other Potential Causes?</h3><p>The purpose of imaging tests — such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a CT scan — in a patient with headache pain is not to diagnose migraine but to diagnose something else besides migraine. These types of diagnostic tests could be used to see if there is any other potential reason that somebody is having attacks of headache.</p><p>If somebody has migraine with symptoms typically accompanying it and without unusual features, then in general they do not need a scan because it is unlikely that there is something else causing their symptoms and the diagnosis is clear based on symptoms. Indeed, the significant majority of individuals with headache don’t need a scan because it is not required for migraine diagnosis and will not affect management.</p><h3>Why Would a Doctor Want Me to Receive a Psychological Evaluation?</h3><p>People with migraine may be confused about why psychological evaluation and treatment are recommended. The key thing to understand is that while psychological factors are not the cause of migraine (it is a genetic neurological disease), psychological issues can exacerbate migraine and stand in the way of getting better. Thus, a psychological evaluation does not help with a migraine diagnosis, but it may help with managing it.</p><p>Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid with migraine and can interfere with the ability to effectively treat migraine. Addressing those issues is important. Just like it is important to address sleep and other lifestyle factors, it’s important to address whether psychological issues or other comorbidities are influencing the ability to treat migraine.</p><p>Psychological approaches can also be helpful in terms of reducing the severity of migraine, and possibly even the frequency of migraine attacks. Psychological approaches can help modulate the brain and body response to having migraine, which is quite variable in individuals. There are certain tools and coping mechanisms that can be learned and that can reduce the impact of migraine attacks on your daily life and ability to function.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Migraine diagnosis is based upon review of medical history and a clinical evaluation, including neurological examination and assessment of a patient’s symptoms, such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and pain characteristics. If you’re unsure how to best prepare for your appointment, there are a few things you can do to help. </p><p>Keeping a headache diary can help your physician understand what you’re experiencing. In this diary, you can note the characteristics of your attacks, such as duration, symptoms, and frequency. In addition to this, you can use the traffic light system to rank migraine disability. It’s also helpful to write down anything that you suspect may be triggering your migraine attacks. Keep in mind that there is no blood test for migraine triggers, nor is there a scan that can diagnose migraine. </p><p>Because migraine is so widespread, any primary care provider may be able to diagnose migraine. More frequent or complicated migraine presentations may require the help of a neurologist or headache specialist. Additionally, you may even consider seeing a psychologist, as psychological issues can exacerbate migraine. Whatever course your migraine journey takes, know that you aren’t alone. A variety of treatment options are available, and seeking a migraine diagnosis is an important first step in managing migraine. </p><p><em>Based on an interview with Dr. Charles and edited by Migraine Again staff.</em></p></main>
