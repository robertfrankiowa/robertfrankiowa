Research links exercise to lower risk of COPD-related hospital admission as well as reduced fatigue, fewer flares, deeper sleep, and better emotional well-being for those with COPD. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy to just grab your running shoes or gym bag and work up a sweat.</p><p>People with COPD can still feel fatigued, dizzy, and short of breath even when taking their medications, and in fact the treatments themselves may contribute to these challenges. This can make the idea of exercising an overwhelming one, especially if you’re concerned it may exacerbate your symptoms.</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts:</strong> Margarita Oks, M.D., a pulmonologist at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City; Scott Kaiser, M.D., a geriatrician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center, in Santa Monica, California; and Thomas Yadegar, M.D., a pulmonologist and medical director of the ICU at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, in California </p><p>But it doesn’t need to be this way. Approaching exercise in a slow-but-steady-wins-the-race fashion can give you all the advantages with a much lower risk of adding fatigue or shortness of breath along the way. Consider these seven steps to begin with.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>1. Talk with your doctor.</strong></h2><p>While both of the main types of COPD—emphysema and chronic bronchitis—involve difficulties with the respiratory system, everyone has a unique starting point when it comes to treatment and lifestyle changes, says Margarita Oks, M.D., a pulmonologist at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.</p><p>For instance, your symptoms may be mild or intermittent, leading you to schedule physical activity on days when you have more energy and feel stronger. However, even so, light exercise may still lead to shortness of breath. Or you might have a more advanced stage of COPD that limits the type of activity you can do and how long you can be active.</p><p>That’s why it’s helpful to check in with your doctor about putting together a realistic exercise plan as part of your COPD management, Dr. Oks adds.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>2. Ask about pulmonary rehab.</strong></h2><p>The American Lung Association notes that pulmonary rehabilitation can be a way to stay active and learn how to exercise without causing your COPD to flare. A rehab program will be led by a professional and consists of education and exercise classes, usually done in a group setting.</p><p>Not only can this give you the resources and understanding you need, but it can also be useful to feel support from a group of individuals who are facing the same challenges. Another advantage is that pulmonary rehab programs are based in a hospital or clinic, so you’re always being closely monitored to ensure you’re exercising safely.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>3. Start with walking.</strong></h2><p>Although there’s a great deal of value in different types of movement like biking, swimming, yoga, and strength training, if you want an easy starting point, consider walking. If you choose a route where you can stop often—for example, a park that has benches, or a walking track in a gym with spots to sit down—you can start to build up endurance gradually and take breaks as you need them, says Dr. Oks.</p><p>And walking pays dividends, too. One study published in the <em>European Respiratory Journal</em> found that participants with moderate-to-severe COPD who did walking training for 30 minutes per session three times a week significantly improved their exercise capacity and quality of life after two months, compared with a control group that received medical care but didn’t walk regularly.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>4. Monitor your oxygen flow.</strong></h2><p>Understanding how exercise affects you is an important part of increasing your stamina and maintaining your energy levels, says Thomas Yadegar, M.D., a pulmonologist and medical director of the ICU at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, in California.</p><p>Much as someone with diabetes can monitor their blood-glucose levels throughout the day, and particularly during exercise and after meals, you can use a wearable pulse oximeter to provide insight into how your body is performing during activity. It can also give you a better understanding of how your oxygen might be fluctuating during the day, and whether factors like poor sleep and stress make a difference.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>5. Challenge yourself, but don’t push.</strong></h2><p>To reap the most benefits from exercise, progression is key. That means doing slightly more with each session—maybe walking an extra half a block, for example, or swimming for a few minutes longer than last time. But it can be tricky to determine what constitutes challenging yourself in beneficial ways, versus pushing yourself even when your body is indicating that you shouldn’t.</p><p>One way to figure out where that line might be is to consider how you feel right after a workout, says Scott Kaiser, M.D., a geriatrician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center, in Santa Monica, California. He notes that in general, when you challenge yourself you may feel a little tired post-exercise, but you’re usually also energized from the activity.</p><p>If you push yourself, on the other hand, you’re more likely to feel depleted and run-down, he says. Other indications that you’re likely going too hard include injuries like strains and sprains, as well as higher levels of muscle soreness.</p><p>So Dr. Kaiser recommends progressing as gradually as possible, and adding to your activity incrementally. Remember that physical activity is a lifelong pursuit, not a sprint to a finish line—so you have time to keep progressing in modest but important ways.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>6. Increase your non-workout movement.</strong></h2><p>When you’re trying to improve your exercise capacity, what you do when you’re not working out matters, too. All the little things throughout the day add up to what’s called non-exercise activity thermogenesis, or NEAT. This represents the energy that’s expended for everything that’s not sleeping, eating, or structured exercise—encompassing everything from shopping for groceries to gardening and mowing to playing with your kids or grandkids. Even fidgeting is considered a form of NEAT.</p><p>And adding even a small extra amount of these types of movements into your everyday mix can be helpful, says Dr. Yadegar. Plus, it will help your body build more strength and endurance over time, which can make exercise easier.</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>7. Set meaningful goals.</strong></h2><p>Once you feel more on track with a consistent exercise routine and are getting more comfortable with physical activity in general, the next step is to begin setting goals that can help you maintain your motivation and progress. These can be modest while remaining meaningful, says Dr. Kaiser.</p><p>For example, you might choose a goal of trying one new type of movement every other week, or every week, if that feels realistic for you. That might mean a gentle yoga or tai chi class, kayaking with a friend, doing some weight-lifting with a personal trainer, or taking a leisurely bike ride. Or your goal might be to work up to walking in a 5K that’s raising money for a nonprofit you support. Or maybe you just want to improve your current stats, such as walking for a longer time or distance without stopping as often.</p><p>Goals create milestones, and those help to provide a sense of progress, adds Dr. Oks. With a condition like COPD, it can often feel like you lack control, especially if your symptoms are becoming more uncomfortable over time. But with a steady-as-it-goes approach to exercise, combined with listening to your body, setting meaningful goals, and staying in touch with your health provider, you can feel more in charge of both your physical and your emotional health.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
