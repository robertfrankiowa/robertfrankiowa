    <main><h1>5 Best Joint Supplements for Men, According to a Nutritionist</h1><h2>Curcumin Phytosome - NSF Certified for Sport</h2><p>Curcumin is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound. It’s what gives turmeric its golden yellow color. Curcumin is effective at improving symptoms and delaying disease cycles of rheumatoid arthritis. Other studies have found that supplementing with curcumin may provide relief of osteoarthritic knee pain, similar to the use of ibuprofen. The main problem is that curcumin is so difficult for the body to absorb, but Thorne Curcumin Phytosome solves that problem. Using just 450 milligrams of Meriva (the curcumin phytosome in Thorne’s supplement) has the same absorption as 4,000 milligrams of ordinary curcumin.</p><p>Thorne’s supplement is also NSF-Certified for Sport, so you know it’s free from banned substances and has been tested for purity and potency. It’s also free from dairy, gluten, and soy, making it a safe option for many food allergies. This particular supplement comes in NSF-Certified for Sport and an uncertified form as well, so many sure you’re buying the one you need if you’re a competing athlete.</p><figure><img title="Curcumin Phytosome - NSF Certified for Sport" src="IMG/AA1b7wgA_curcumin_phytosome___nsf_certified_for_sport.jpg" alt="Curcumin Phytosome - NSF Certified for Sport"><figcaption><em>Curcumin Phytosome - NSF Certified for Sport.

While the canister may be inconvenient to carry around if you like to drink your collage on the go, you can always purchase the individual sticks, which add a little more waste but fit easily in the car or gym bag.</p><p>It has 18 grams of protein, which absolutely can help you hit your protein goals, but it shouldn’t be used as a primary protein source as it’s missing several essential amino acids and is not a complete protein. We love the unflavored collagen peptides because they mix into any liquid, including water, juice, smoothies, or coffee, undetected. But if you want some variety, you can choose several flavors as well, including lemon, chocolate, and matcha, although not all of them are NSF-Certified for Sport.</p><figure><img title="Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder" src="IMG/AA1hp5xa_vital_proteins_collagen_peptides_powder.jpg" alt="Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder"><figcaption><em>Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Nature Made TripleFlex Triple Strength Caplets (200)</h2><p>You don’t have to spend an arm and a leg on a supplement that supports your joints. Nature Made supplements are budget-friendly, costing just about a quarter a serving, and high value, as they carry a USP verification so you can be assured they’ve been tested for purity and potency.</p><p>This supplement is a triple threat to joint pain and stiffness, containing 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine, 800 milligrams of chondroitin, and 750 milligrams of Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), in addition to 250 percent DV of vitamin D3. The combination of glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM may help improve joint function, pain, and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis. Adding vitamin D as highly absorbable D3 can help reduce the number of supplements you need, as the most recent NHANES study found that only 34.5 percent of American adults have sufficient vitamin D levels.</p><figure><img title="Nature Made TripleFlex Triple Strength Caplets (200)" src="IMG/BB1pmd7E_nature_made_tripleflex_triple_strength_caplets_200.jpg" alt="Nature Made TripleFlex Triple Strength Caplets (200)"><figcaption><em>Nature Made TripleFlex Triple Strength Caplets (200). amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Garden of Life Quercetin Post Workout Recovery</h2><p>Garden of Life Quercetin Recovery supports joint health and promotes recovery after exercise, making it an ideal supplement for athletes. As it’s Informed Choice Certified, you can be sure that it has everything it says and nothing it doesn't. While quercetin can accelerate the recovery of muscle function and reduce soreness after exercise for athletes, it also benefits those who are more sedentary and not as routinely tough on their joints.</p><p>You can find quercetin in smaller amounts in foods like berries, tomatoes, apples, and leafy greens, but this antioxidant is much more potent and effective at easing joint pain when consumed in higher doses, like the 500 milligrams you’ll find in Garden of Life’s Recovery. In addition to quercetin, you’ll get zinc, green tea, turmeric root, pomegranate, and probiotics to help support a healthy immune system and fight inflammation. You’ll want to check with your doctor before adding this supplement to your diet on a regular basis, as quercetin may interact with many different types of medications, and you may not want to take high doses of zinc for extended periods of time.</p><figure><img title="Garden of Life Quercetin Post Workout Recovery" src="IMG/BB1pm61c_garden_of_life_quercetin_post_workout_recovery.jpg" alt="Garden of Life Quercetin Post Workout Recovery"><figcaption><em>Garden of Life Quercetin Post Workout Recovery. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Pure Alaska Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil</h2><p>Pure Alaska Omega Wild Salmon Oil is USP-verified for purity and potency and contains 600 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids per serving of 2 soft gels, which includes 220 milligrams of DHA and 180 milligrams of EPA. Research has found that omega-3 fatty acids routinely help reduce the number of NSAIDs used by people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, most likely related to its ability to reduce inflammation in the body. Each supplement also contains 25% of the daily value of vitamin D, which low levels of have been linked to higher rates of joint pain in those with osteoarthritis.</p><p>There is no standard amount of omega-3 fatty acids for joint support, but a 2015 study found that doses as low as 1,000 mg of fish oil with 400 mg of EPA and 200 mg of DHA for 8 weeks significantly improved knee function and satisfaction for those with osteoarthritic knee pain. And while this supplement obviously contains fish, it’s free from crustacean shellfish, eggs, gluten, lactose, milk, peanuts, sesame, soy, tree nuts, and wheat, which makes it a great choice for anyone suffering from food allergies or sensitivities.</p></main>
