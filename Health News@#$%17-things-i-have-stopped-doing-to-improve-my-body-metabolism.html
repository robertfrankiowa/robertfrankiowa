    <main><h1>17 Things I Have Stopped Doing To Improve My Body Metabolism</h1><p>Imagine waking up daily with boundless energy, a vibrant sense of well-being, and a metabolism that’s working for you, not against you. Yes, it’s totally achievable! </p><p>These simple yet powerful changes have helped me shed those stubborn pounds and revitalized my zest for life. Are you ready to uncover the secrets to turbo-charging your metabolism? </p><h2>Counting Calories</h2><p>Sounds counterintuitive, right? But hear me out. Focusing intensely on calorie counting can increase stress levels and have a negative relationship with food, ultimately impeding metabolic function. Instead of fixating on numbers, I started paying more attention to the food quality I consumed. </p><p>The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Healthstresses the importance of a balanced diet filled with vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins over a simple calorie count. My digestion improved and I felt more vibrant and alive. Plus, I had more freedom and enjoyment in my meals, which kept me motivated and satisfied.</p><h2>Late-Night Snacking</h2><p>I stopped reaching for that midnight snack when I learned that eating late can seriously disrupt your body’s natural rhythm. Dr. Michael Breus (The Sleep Doctor) notes that late-night eating can lower the release of ghrelin (growth hormone), which is crucial in metabolism and muscle repair.</p><p>Let’s be honest, it’s easier to grab a bag of chips than to whip up a healthy salad when it’s past bedtime. Plus, I’ve found that avoiding these snacks helps me sleep better, and better sleep, in turn, supports a healthy metabolic rate. By saying goodbye to late-night snacks, I’ve allowed my body to rest, repair, and regulate itself more effectively. Try drinking herbal tea or brushing your teeth immediately after dinner.</p><figure><img title="Late-Night Snacking" src="IMG/BB1pHMUs_late_night_snacking.jpg" alt="Late-Night Snacking"><figcaption><em>Late-Night Snacking.

I noticed a significant boost in my energy levelswhen I started eating regular meals. Plus, I could concentrate better and feel more uplifted throughout the day. </p><p>Research by the National Institute of Health points out that eating multiple small meals spread out through the day can help maintain a stable blood sugar level, which is crucial for metabolic health. When you skip meals, your body goes into “starvation mode,” conserving energy and slowing your metabolism. Instead of burning through calories, your body becomes more efficient at storing fat!</p><figure><img title="Skipping Meals" src="IMG/BB1pHP0g_skipping_meals.jpg" alt="Skipping Meals"><figcaption><em>Skipping Meals.

Water isn’t just essential for quenching thirst; it’s vital for keeping your metabolism humming. A study by the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</em>highlights that drinking 17 ounces of water (500ml) increased metabolic rate by 30% in both men and women. </p><p>When I started drinking more water, I noticed I had more energy, my skin looked better, and I even felt fuller, which helped me avoid unnecessary snacking. A great rule of thumb suggested by health experts is the “8×8” rule-drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily. And it’s not just any water; staying hydrated with clean, filtered water is key. </p><h2>Prioritizing Protein Intake</h2><p>I was obsessed with prioritizing protein intake, thinking it was the magic bullet for boosting my metabolism. However, I’ve since discovered that balance is vital. Overloading protein can stress the kidneys, especially if water intake isn’t adequately increased, and lead to an imbalance in nutrient consumption. </p><p>Moreover, focusing solely on high protein often meant missing out on important nutrients from other food groups, which arevital for a well-rounded metabolism. Dr. Mark Hyman, in his book <em>Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?</em> points out that while protein is crucial, it’s equally important to consume various vegetables, fruits, and whole grains to maintain metabolic health.</p><figure><img title="Prioritizing Protein Intake" src="IMG/BB1pHP0s_prioritizing_protein_intake.jpg" alt="Prioritizing Protein Intake"><figcaption><em>Prioritizing Protein Intake.  Courtesy of True Activist </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Relying Solely on Cardio</h2><p>At first, I thought hours on the treadmill or endless spin classes were the key to a faster metabolism. I learned that overdoing them can lead to muscle loss without proper balance. </p><p>Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue,meaning maintaining muscle is essential for a high metabolic rate. Additionally, integrating strength training into my routine has introduced me to the Afterburn Effect (Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption or EPOC). The Afterburn Effect can continue for up to 48 hours post-strength training session.</p><h2>Not Getting Enough Sleep</h2><p>Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep every night to function at their best, reports the National Sleep Foundation. When I wasn’t getting enough rest, my body didn’t stand a chance at optimizing my metabolism. Sleep restriction (reducing sleep duration to 5 hours per night for a week) can decrease insulin sensitivity by 20%, making it harder for the body to handle sugar and potentially leading to weight gain. </p><p>Ghrelin, the hormone that makes you feel hungry, goes up, while leptin, which makes you feel full, goes down. No wonder I was craving sugary snacks all the time! An extra hour or two of snooze time can be a game-changer for boosting metabolism! </p><h2>High Stress Levels</h2><p>According to a study by Yale University, high levels of stress hormones such as prolactin can increase appetite and lead to overeating, particularly high-calorie comfort foods. When I was constantly stressed, my body held onto fat like it was a precious resource, making it much harder to lose weight. My body was yelling, “We might need this later!” </p><p>Stress also affects sleep quality, and poor sleep can further slow metabolism. By implementing stress-reducing activities like yoga andmeditation and simply taking time to breathe deeply, I feel lighter andmore energetic, and my metabolism has never been better. </p><h2>Ignoring Health Check-Ups</h2><p>Regular medical exams help catch health issues early when they’re more easily treatable. For example, undiagnosed thyroid problems can be a sneaky saboteur of your metabolism. A sluggish thyroid, or hypothyroidism, can significantly slow down your metabolism, leading to low energy levels and weight gain. </p><p>The American Thyroid Association notes that more than 12 percent of the U.S. population will develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime, and up to 60percent of those ffected are unaware of their condition. I realized that by being proactive and scheduling those check-ups, I could address potential issues like thyroid imbalances, nutrient deficiencies, or even undiagnosed conditions like diabetes.</p><h2>Avoiding Protein in Breakfast</h2><p>I had to change my game when I learned that avoiding protein made my metabolism sluggish. Protein helps in muscle repair and growth; more muscle means a higher resting metabolic rate. </p><p>Eating a high-protein breakfast can increase your metabolism by up to 30% for several hours post-meal. After switching things up, my energy levels skyrocketed, and my overall metabolism hummed along much more efficiently. Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast like Greek yogurt, eggs, or a protein smoothie.</p><h2>Drinking Alcohol Regularly</h2><p>I enjoyed the occasional glass of wine or a fun cocktail night out with friends. Alcohol can reduce the body’s fat-burning ability by up to 73%! When I stopped drinking alcohol regularly, I noticed that my energy levels surged, and I felt lighter and more agile. </p><p>Alcohol also disrupts sleep cycles, and poor sleep can lead to an array of metabolic issues. So, ditching those regular margaritas was a no-brainer for me. Plus, I don’t miss those sluggish, hungover mornings at all! Limit your alcohol intake and opt for sparkling water with a splash of lemon.</p><h2>Overdoing It with Caffeine</h2><p>Oh, those countless cups of coffee that I thought were my ticket to a high-energy day! Moderate coffee drinkers (about 3 to 4 cups a day) have a slightly higher metabolic rate than non-drinkers. However, the trouble starts when you go overboard. </p><p>Excessive caffeine can increase cortisol levels-your stress hormone going haywire. Elevated cortisol has been linked to various metabolic disturbances, including weight gain, especially around the abdomen. Now, I limit myself to just one cozy cup in the morning, and honestly, I feel more balanced and less jittery throughout the day. </p><h2>Eating Too Fast</h2><p>Harvard Health Publishing emphasizes that gobbling down meals can lead to overeating because it takes about 20 minutes for our brains to realize we’re full. I started taking my time with meals, and the results were incredible. </p><p>Listening to my body’s signals meant I stopped eating when I was satisfied, not stuffed. Plus, slowing down allowed me to savor my food, making each meal a delightful experience rather than a rushed task. </p><figure><img title="Eating Too Fast" src="IMG/BB1pHMVF_eating_too_fast.jpg" alt="Eating Too Fast"><figcaption><em>Eating Too Fast.

A study in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> highlighted that people who consumed sugary beverages regularly had a 26% greater risk of suffering Type 2 diabetes than those who didn’t.</p><p>Since switching to water and herbal teas, no more sugar crashes or mid-afternoon slumps! Instead, I felt more energetic and focused throughout the day. And who could forget the reduced calorie intake? A single can of soda can contain up to150 calories-all empty ones! Choose water, herbal teas, or black coffee instead.</p><h2>Neglecting Fiber Intake</h2><p>I used to think that fiber was just something you needed to keep your digestion in check. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics advises that women should consume at least 25 grams of fiber daily, while men should target about 38 grams. Why? Because fiber-rich foods like fruits, veggies, and whole grains help slow digestion, making you feel fuller for longer and reducing overall calorie intake.</p><p>A study by the Department of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Minnesota, found that increasing fiber by just 14 grams per day was linked to a 10% decrease in calorie intake.So, I’ve made it a point to include more fiber in my diet by munching on apples, adding chia seeds to my morning smoothies, and swapping out white bread for whole-grain alternatives. </p><h2>Eating Large Portions</h2><p>One of the first things I realized on my journey to improving my metabolism was that eating large portions slowed me down. According to the Mayo Clinic, consuming too much food at once can lead to an overload ofcalories that our bodies struggle to process efficiently. This can result in slowed digestion and a sluggish metabolic rate.</p><p>By eating smaller, more frequent meals, I’ve kept my metabolism humming along nicely. Plus, focusing on portion control helps prevent overeating, which can lead to metabolic syndrome. This condition includes health problems like increased blood pressure and high blood sugar.</p><h2>Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle</h2><p>I used to love lounging on the couch for hours, binge-watching my favorite shows. But as cozy as that might sound, I quickly realized that prolonged inactivity can decrease the enzymes involved in breaking down fats, resulting in a sluggish metabolic rate. </p><p>I knew I had to change, so I started incorporating more movement into my daily routine. Whether taking short walks during the day, opting for the stairs instead of the elevator, or having a mini dance party in my living room, I’ve consciously tried to keep my body moving.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> – <i>This list is solely the author’s opinion based on research and publicly available information.</i></p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><ul>   <li><strong>Healthline:</strong> “The 3-Day Fix to Supercharging Your Metabolism”</li>   <li><strong>Verywell Health:</strong> “How to Boost Metabolism: 12 Natural Ways”</li>   <li><strong>Mind Body Green:</strong> “7 Easy Ways To Reset Your Metabolism & Enhance Whole-Body Health”</li>   <li><strong>US News Health:</strong> “10 Tips to Increase Metabolism”</li>  </ul><h2>16 Good Habits That Will Improve Every Aspect of Your Life</h2><p class="text-body font-regular text-gray-800 leading-[24px] pt-[9px] pb-[2px]">In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life.
