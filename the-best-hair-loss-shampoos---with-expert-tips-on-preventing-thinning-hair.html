    <main><h1>The best hair-loss shampoos - with expert tips on preventing thinning hair</h1><p>Hair loss and thinning hair is one of the most common haircare troubles - and it can be caused by anything from stress to medical conditions, menopause or diet.</p><p>While it’s always a good idea to check in with a doctor when trying to find the root cause of hair loss, many people find that adding a specially formulated hair-loss shampoo to their haircare routine can help with hair regrowth as well as preventing breakage and adding volume to fine hair.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Best shampoos for hair loss at a glance</h3><p>Best value: Pantene Grow Strong Shampoo with Biotin and Bamboo, £7.50</p><h2>Do shampoos for hair loss really work?</h2><p>There’s no one-size-fits all cure for hair loss - and what works for one person may not work for another. But, hair loss shampoos are definitely a good product to try - and many haircare fans swear by them.</p><p>We spoke to award-winning Award-winning hairdresser and founder of Perfect Silhouette Hairdressing, Robyn Wood, who told us: “Hair loss shampoos are a good place to start; however, doing your research is key! I would always recommend checking ingredients before using any new products - you want ingredients that help induce hair growth and may be left disappointed if a product doesn’t live up to this. </p><p>"If you are going to use hair loss shampoo, I would recommend doing this in conjunction with a healthy diet and sourcing the correct vitamins to go alongside this."</p><p>Scroll to the end for Robyn's top tips for preventing hair loss and thinning hair...</p><h2>How to use</h2><p>Most manufacturers suggest using hair loss shampoos at least five times a week for three months or so to see results. Take a small amount (the powerful mix of active ingredients means that you don’t need an excessive amount) and massage into the scalp, working up a good lather.</p><p>Leave on for three or four minutes to let the shampoo’s ingredients absorb, then rinse away. Some shampoos are leave in, others can even be applied to dry hair asa smoothing agent - check the instructions carefully.</p><h2>How we chose the best hair loss shampoos</h2><ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>We wanted to cater to all budgets in this round-up, so whether you're looking for something on the cheaper end of the scale or if you have more to spend, you'll find a product that best suits your needs.</li><li><strong>Trusted brands:</strong> The brands featured are all known and loved by the HELLO! shopping team of experts.</li><li><strong>Reviews:</strong> We always recommend products we’ve used and loved - in the instance we couldn't test the hair loss shampoo we included hair loss shampoos that only had a high volume of positive reviews from verified shoppers.</li><li><strong>Best-sellers: </strong>All the hair loss shampoos featured top the best-seller lists of our trusted retailers</li></ul><ul class="affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf--normal"><li class="affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7"><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Watermans Grow Me Hair Growth Shampoo</h2><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Watermans Grow Me Hair Growth Shampoo</h3><ul><li><strong>Main ingredients:</strong> Biotin, Argan Oil, Rosemary, Niacinamide, Caffeine, Lupin Protein, Allantoin</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> 250ml</li><li><strong>Vegan and animal cruelty-free?</strong> Yes</li><li><strong>Hair types:</strong> All</li><li><strong>Top review: </strong>“I've been using this shampoo on my hair, and it's been a game changer.

Why is it specifically targeted at men? Its special caffeine complex inhibits the negative influence of testosterone at the hair root to prevent hair loss. It’s also formulated for sensitive skin - men’s skin is more sensitive than women’s skin because of testosterone - it makes men’s skin less robust and weakens its natural protective function significantly.</p><p>£16.90 FOR TWO AT AMAZON UK</p><p>£8.60 FOR ONE AT BOOTS</p></li><li class="affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7"><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Philip Kingsley Denisty Shampoo</h2><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Philip Kingsley Denisty Shampoo</h3><ul><li><strong>Main ingredients: </strong>Hyper-Branched Polymers, Hydrolyzed Pea Peptides, Strengthening Molecules</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> 200ml</li><li><strong>Vegan and animal cruelty-free?</strong> Yes</li><li><strong>Hair types:</strong> All</li><li><strong>Top review:</strong> “My hair is thin and not so great as menopause it’s doing its worst on it.

On top of it it smells great and the amount of money you pay for it, is just nothing as it’s worth every penny.”</li></ul><p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Philip Kingsley is a trichologist-backed haircare brand, and a go-to many swear by to target a variety of hair concerns, including hair loss. There are a whole host of ranges to shop to suit every need, from detoxifying scalp treatments, nourishing formulations, and thickening capsules, but the Density range is the go-to for hair growth.</p><p>£27 AT PHILIP KINGSLEY</p></li><li class="affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7"><h2 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Champo Pitta volumising shampoo and conditioner</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Hello!

"It’s important to examine these factors and determine why your hair may be thinning. I am a big believer in putting good stuff in to get good stuff out. Anything to do with hair growth and not the condition of the hair will mostly come from inside your body. </p><p>"A great way to give it a boost is to take hair skin and nail supplements. There are plenty on the market, I take gummiesand they have proved to be a great help in thickening my hair and helping my hair grow faster. Look for ones with a high level of biotin. You’ll need to be taking them consistently for 3 months to notice any difference, so stick with it and always check with your doctor if you are unsure about taking any new medication or supplements. </p><p>"Another option that is worth a look is scalp massagers. They are a little brush, usually silicone, that you can use on your scalp in the shower or on dry hair to help improve circulation to the scalp, in turn improving the hair follicle quality. Be aware that you will need to massage for at least 10 minutes a day for up to 5 months to notice a difference, studies reveal. </p><p>"If you are continuing to lose hair or noticing bald spots, consult your doctor as there may be an underlying issue that needs addressing by a medical professional.”</p><h2>Meet the expert</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Hello!
