    <main><h1>I Lost Over 129 Pounds with These Cereal Hacks</h1><h2>1 Perfect Post-Workout Snack</h2><p>In the clip, Mike gives a shout-out to Jordan Crocker, who is famous for concocting delicious treats that are a lot healthier than they taste. "This is by far my favorite way to eat cereal as I continue losing weight and try to get a little extra protein in my diet," says Mike. "It makes for the perfect post-workout snack, and it is a delicious recipe created by Jordan Crocker, an absolute mad scientist when it comes to inventing delectable protein treats."</p><h2>2 You Start with Your Favorite Cereal</h2><p>"But anyway, this is how you make it," he says. "You start out with one serving of your favorite cereal." His cereal of choice? Golden Grahams.</p><figure><img title="2 You Start with Your Favorite Cereal" src="IMG/BB1oQXur_2_you_start_with_your_favorite_cereal.jpg" alt="2 You Start with Your Favorite Cereal"><figcaption><em>2 You Start with Your Favorite Cereal. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Then, Add Protein Powder</h2><p>Next up, you add "one serving of your favorite protein powder," says Mike. He uses Ghost Whey Protein, a "cereal milk" powder.</p><h2>4 Pour Sugar-Free Syrup into the Mix</h2><p>"Then, into the cereal and protein powder, you will add 50 grams of your favorite sugar-free syrup," he continues. He uses Cary's sugar-free, low-calorie syrup.</p><h2>5 Mix, Spread Onto Parchment Paper, and Freeze</h2><p>"Mix it all up and spread it out on some parchment paper or tin foil like I did," he continues. "Then just pop it in the freezer for about an hour or two."</p><figure><img title="5 Mix, Spread Onto Parchment Paper, and Freeze" src="IMG/BB1oQXur_5_mix_spread_onto_parchment_paper_and_freeze.jpg" alt="5 Mix, Spread Onto Parchment Paper, and Freeze"><figcaption><em>5 Mix, Spread Onto Parchment Paper, and Freeze. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 The Cookie-Like Treat Looks Delicious</h2><p>"And let me just tell you, this thing is so delicious. I had to give it a kiss," he says at the end of the video while eating the scrumptious, cookie-like treat.</p><figure><img title="6 The Cookie-Like Treat Looks Delicious" src="IMG/BB1oQVp3_6_the_cookie_like_treat_looks_delicious.jpg" alt="6 The Cookie-Like Treat Looks Delicious"><figcaption><em>6 The Cookie-Like Treat Looks Delicious. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Protein Powder Makes a Good Milk Replacement, Says our Expert</h2><p>"This is definitely a unique combination," says Collingwood. "I like the protein powder instead of just using milk to boost up the protein content of the breakfast." While sugar-free syrup "has no nutritional value, at least it also is not high in calories or real sugar, but Some non-nutritive sweeteners can fit in a lower calorie diet each day." she adds.</p><figure><img title="7 Protein Powder Makes a Good Milk Replacement, Says our Expert" src="IMG/AA1nrRHa_7_protein_powder_makes_a_good_milk_replacement_says_our_expert.jpg" alt="7 Protein Powder Makes a Good Milk Replacement, Says our Expert"><figcaption><em>7 Protein Powder Makes a Good Milk Replacement, Says our Expert. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Our Expert Says: Go for It!</h2><p>And, even though the Golden Grahams do have some added sugar, "they are also made with some whole grain (about 1/4 of your whole grain for the day in one serving), and one serving is not overly high in calories," says Collingwood. Overall, Collingwood approves of Mike's trick of transforming cereal into a high-protein treat. "It can provide that crunch and a little bit of sweet you might be looking for," she says.</p><h2>9 Mike Meal Plans</h2><p>In another video, Mike shared 5 simple changes he made to his diet and eating habits that helped him drop weight and keep it off. One tactic that Mike uses to lose weight is meal planning. He regularly shares videos detailing everything he eats in a day and explains that he plans his meals ahead of time – especially when he works 11-hour days.</p><h2>10 Here Is Why You Should Consider Meal Planning</h2><p>Studies have found that the more meals you eat prepared away from home, the higher your risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and early death. And, one study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity found meal planning was associated with a healthier diet and less obesity.</p><h2>11 He Eats Lots of Protein</h2><p>In one video, Mike shares his weekly shopping list, revealing that he bases his meals around protein. "For the protein sources, we have extra lean ground beef and some super extra lean ground Turkey breast."</p><h2>12 Here Is Why Eating Enough Protein Is Important</h2><p>There is ample research that consuming more protein than the recommended dietary allowance not only reduces body weight (BW), but also enhances body composition by decreasing fat mass while preserving fat-free mass (FFM) in both low-calorie and standard-calorie diets.</p><h2>13 He Doesn't Drink His Calories</h2><p>Mike just says no to high calorie sodas. In a recent video, Mike reveals that he brings Diet Dr. Pepper to work with him. He also drinks zero calorie water flavor packs with his water and energy drinks to offer a boost of caffeine.</p><h2>14 Here Is Why You Should Swap Regular Soda for Diet Soda</h2><p>"Diet soda will be calorie-free versus a lot of sugar in regular soda, which means a lot of empty calories that don't provide any fullness either," explains Body Network's Resident RDN, Tara Collingwood, and co-author of the Flat Belly Cookbook for Dummies.</p><h2>15 He Supplements with Creatine</h2><p>Mike also supplements with creatine." This is the only supplement I currently take because I don't feel like buying any others, but I will take a scoop of this after I'm done eating lunch," he says.</p><h2>16 Here Is Why You Should Consider Creatine</h2><p>The Mayo Clinic explains that creatine can help with Strength, muscle size, and performance. "Oral creatine use might allow an athlete to do more work during reps or sprints, leading to greater gains in strength, muscle mass, and performance. Creatine is often used by athletes involved in high-intensity intermittent activities that require a rapid recovery during training and competition," they say. It can also help prevent injury. "Oral creatine might reduce the frequency of dehydration, muscle cramping, and injuries to the muscles, bones, ligaments, tendons and nerves."</p><h2>17 Healthy Condiments for On-the-Go Flavor</h2><p>Mike has also revealed in his many videos that he packs healthy condiments. This includes Chipotle Tabasco sauce and Sweet Baby Rays, no sugar added, and sweet and spicy barbecue sauce.</p><h2>18 Smart Condiment Swaps Cut Sneaky Calories</h2><p>Most weight loss experts remind that condiments often contain lots of hidden calories. Many people forget to include these when tallying up their daily food intake. Swapping out high calorie condiments for lower sugar, lower calorie options will help you cut hundreds of calories per day.
