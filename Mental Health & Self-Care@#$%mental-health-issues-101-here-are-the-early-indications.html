Studies suggest that untreated depression and bipolar disorder in middle-aged men and women can evolve into dementia in old age. However, mental health decline isn't a natural part of aging. In fact, mental health disorders affect younger adults more often than the elderly. But seniors are less likely to seek help or treatment.</p><h2 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78123 server-jss78237 server-jss78505">Common mental health conditions in seniors</h2><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Depression and mood disorders, like bipolar disorder, affect up to 5% of seniors 65 and older. That number increases to 13.5% among seniors who require nursing care or are hospitalized.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Anxiety disorders often coexist with depression or bipolar disorder. They include a range of issues, from hoarding syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder to phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Nearly 8% of adults older than 65 have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Dementia is not itself a mental illness, but a syndrome that involves progressive damage to the brain, causing cognitive impairment and a decline in mental health. About seven million adults age 65 and older - approximately 11% of seniors - have Alzheimer's disease and dementia.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Substance use disorder is another concerning mental health issue rising in seniors, which can lead to all of the mental disorders above. As reported in recent data by the National Institute on drug abuse, nearly one million (or about 2%) of adults over 65 live with a substance abuse disorder (or SUD).</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Oftentimes, these mental health issues go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to even more severe symptoms.</p><h3 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78122 server-jss78236 server-jss78511">Risk factors for mental health disorders in seniors</h3><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">The normal emotional and physical stresses associated with aging can become risk factors for mental disorders. It's important to pay close attention to your aging loved one's mental health, especially if they're living alone or aren't able to socialize as often as they once did.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Risk factors for mental health decline in seniors can include the following:</p><ul class="server-jss78516 ">   <li class="">Alcohol or substance abuse</li>   <li class="">Social isolation and loneliness</li>   <li class="">Dementia-causing illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease</li>   <li class="">Grief and losing a loved one</li>   <li class="">Long-term illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease</li>   <li class="">Chronic pain</li>   <li class="">Medication interactions or side effects</li>   <li class="">Physical disability or loss of mobility</li>   <li class="">Physical illnesses that affect emotion, memory, and thought</li>   <li class="">Poor diet and malnutrition</li>   </ul><h2 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78123 server-jss78237 server-jss78505">How to assess the severity of mental illness in the elderly</h2><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">One ongoing issue with diagnosing and treating mental disorders in seniors is the fact that older adults are more likely to report physical symptoms than emotional or psychological ones.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">In fact, many seniors may not recognize their own mental health issues. That said, family members should help by assessing their loved one's daily life to track any issues they may be experiencing. Consider keeping a log of how your family member is maintaining the following areas of their life:</p><ul class="server-jss78516 ">   <li class="">Life tasks and self-care activities, such as dressing, preparing meals, or using the phone</li>   <li class="">Safety, including financial safety and driving</li>   <li class="">Physical health, including pain or uncomfortable symptoms, hospitalizations, or loss of appetite</li>   <li class="">Mood and brain health, such as feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in activities they used to enjoy, or isolation</li>   <li class="">Medication safety, including skipping medications and worrisome side effects or symptoms related to medications</li>   </ul><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Identifying problems in the above areas can help your family determine whether a consultation with a doctor is warranted. Acknowledgment from a doctor of a mental disorder can pave the way for a calm and effective discussion with your loved one about their treatment options.</p><h2 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78123 server-jss78237 server-jss78505">Treatment of elderly mental health issues</h2><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">For depression in seniors, the American Psychological Association (APA) treatment guidelines recommend various forms of psychotherapy and, in severe cases, second-generation antidepressants.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">For a dementia diagnosis, there is no known cure, but there are a wide variety of dementia treatment options that show promise in slowing the progression of the disease. These include lifestyle and behavior modifications as well as a variety of therapies.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Anxiety and substance use disorder can be mitigated and prevented in similar ways. Even depression is shown to respond positively to many of the approaches below.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Mental disorder prevention in seniors typically focuses on healthy aging practices and treatment approaches like the following:</p><ul class="server-jss78516 ">   <li class="">Cognitive stimulation</li>   <li class="">Lifestyle choices, like healthy sleep, diet, and exercise</li>   <li class="">Healthy socialization habits</li>   <li class="">Physical therapies, like yoga, Pilates, and dance</li>   <li class="">Behavioral, talk therapies, and mindfulness practices</li>   <li class="">Alternative therapies, like light and vitamin therapy</li>   <li class="">Music therapy</li>   <li class="">Certain medications</li>   </ul><h3 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78122 server-jss78236 server-jss78511">Treatment for caregivers</h3><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Heather Adams, a psychology professor at the University of Phoenix in Modesto, California, strongly advises caregivers of seniors with mental illnesses to seek out support for themselves as well.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">"Managing an elderly parent with a mental disorder is emotionally taxing," Adams says. "Sometimes speaking with a therapist can help adult children create a plan for addressing issues with an elderly parent."</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Additionally, caregiver support groups can help you connect with others in the same situation.</p><h2 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78123 server-jss78237 server-jss78505">How to talk to an elder about their mental health</h2><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Some seniors who need help don't seek treatment because they dismiss their mental changes as a natural part of aging, or are ashamed of talking about it. Another potential obstacle is that your loved one might resist the idea they even have a problem. Below we list some tips from Professor Adams on how to begin this conversation.</p><h3 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78122 server-jss78236 server-jss78511">1. Focus on symptoms rather than the disorder itself</h3><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">"If the elderly parent is unwilling to acknowledge their disorder, it may help to focus on symptoms rather than the disorder itself. This also works well for encouraging an elderly parent to schedule a doctor's visit," Adams explains.</p><h3 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78122 server-jss78236 server-jss78511">2. Find a time to speak when you're both calm</h3><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">This will make it easier for you and your loved one to listen to each other and speak your minds. Then, explain your needs and stress the benefits of care, such as symptom relief. Be prepared to compromise with your loved one's specific treatment or care preferences.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">"For anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorders, depressive, or bipolar disorders, it's beneficial to delay discussion until the elderly parent has come out of an episode," says Adams. "Manic or depressive episodes create a difficult environment for discussing sensitive topics."</p><h3 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78122 server-jss78236 server-jss78511">3. Take their resistance in stride</h3><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">"When resistance occurs, shift the conversation to less inflammatory aspects of your concerns. Threats or emotional outbursts will only add anxiety and shut down communication," Adams says. "Remember not to take outbursts personally and know that they often stem from fear of the unknown."</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Your loved one may not want to discuss the topic when you bring it up. The Mayo Clinic advises trying again later. The same goes for conversations that may take a wrong turn and get off topic, turning too emotional.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">"If you feel yourself becoming emotional, the best advice is to take a break from the conversation and choose another time to discuss the topic," Adams says.</p><h2 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78123 server-jss78237 server-jss78505">Next steps: Prepare necessary paperwork</h2><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">"In cases where an elderly parent is a danger to themselves or others, adult children may want to acquire a medical power of attorney for their elderly parent so they can make medical decisions on their behalf," explains Adams.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">Many mental health disorders pose unique challenges to communication, so senior legal planning and gathering proper documents before they're needed is essential.</p><h2 class="server-jss78118 server-jss78123 server-jss78237 server-jss78505">Seek help if needed</h2><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">If your parent's mental illness is beyond your capacity to provide care for, don't hesitate to seek assistance from a professional. Their family doctor or a geriatrician is a good resource to start with.</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">These professionals may recommend long-term senior care options, such as the following:</p><p class="server-jss78118 server-jss78142 server-jss78169 server-jss78509">If you need to find long-term senior care options in your area, reach out to one of A Place for Mom's Senior Living Advisors.
