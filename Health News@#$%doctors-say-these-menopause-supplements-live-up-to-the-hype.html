    <main><h1>Doctors Say These Menopause Supplements Live Up to the Hype</h1><h2>Relizen</h2><p>Minkin gives Relizen the thumbs up, noting that she’s “seen results” with it. Relizen aims to help relieve hot flashes and night sweats, and the company has data that backs up its use. A survey of more than 2,300 Relizen users found that 75% had less-intense hot flashes after three months of taking the supplement and 68% reported having less night sweats than before. The survey also found that 88% of users plan to continue taking the supplement. Its main ingredient is Swedish flower pollen extract, which has been linked to both PMS and menopause symptom relief. </p><p><strong>What the reviews say</strong>: “No more changing PJs in the middle of the night…or feeling as if you’re roasting in the middle of a blizzard!!! Relizen started working for me after two months and I have not missed a day since starting it six months ago!!! So grateful!!” said a customer.</p><h2>Remifemin</h2><p>Remifemin is an estrogen-free supplement that’s designed to reduce hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings. Its main ingredient is black cohosh, which is considered to be a substitute for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). There is a lot of data on the use of Remifemin, and one randomized, double-blind, controlled study of 244 menopausal women with fibroids found that it reduced symptoms of menopause in this group. Minkin says she’s seen this supplement be helpful with some of her patients. At 21 cents a pill, this is an affordable option. </p><p><strong>What the reviews say</strong>: “I can’t believe I didn’t find Remifemin sooner! This product is a game-changer,“ said a fan. “My hot flashes have significantly decreased and my mood swings are much more manageable. Not only that, but I feel confident knowing that Nature’s Way is a trusted brand and that this supplement is clinically proven.”</p><h2>Estrovera</h2><p>Estrovera works to target different symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and anxiety, according to the company. Metagenics has conducted several studies on Estrovera and one study found that the tablets reduce hot flashes by up to 83%. The supplement is tested by a third party and passes the USP Good Manufacturing Practices Audit Program, which is used to guarantee that a product meets high standards. </p><p><strong>What the reviews say</strong>: Shared one fan: “It does take a couple of months, but it truly works. My hot flashes have all but dissipated.”</p><h2>Women’s Menopause Multivitamin</h2><p>One a Day’s Women’s Menopause Multivitamin is designed to help support your nutritional needs through the menopause journey. It contains vitamins D, A, and C, along with zinc and calcium to promote good health. The formula also has soy isoflavones, which research has linked to less hot flashes and mood changes.</p><p><strong>What the reviews say</strong>: “Things were getting desperate. This has not solved all of my issues but it has made menopause much more tolerable,” said a reviewer. “I don’t have any more night sweats and I am sleeping better. Also, I have more energy during the day. This stuff has been a lifesaver for me.”</p><figure><img title="Women’s Menopause Multivitamin" src="IMG/AA1dtsgt_womens_menopause_multivitamin.jpg" alt="Women’s Menopause Multivitamin"><figcaption><em>Women’s Menopause Multivitamin. One a Day</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Fan Club</h2><p>Menopause can lead to a range of symptoms, including constipation and bloating. Hum’s Fan Club includes a special strain of probiotics called Lactobacillus plantarum to help. It also has rhapontic rhubarb (like Estrovera), along with grape seed extract to target several symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and night sweats. Fan Club was third-party tested on 100 women and found that 87% of participants had fewer hot flashes. It’s also certified by the Clean Label Project for purity. </p><p> <strong>What the reviews say</strong>: “This has really stopped my hot flashes!” shared a fan. “After just a couple of weeks I am not experiencing them. I’m on my second bottle and hope it never stops working.”</p><h2>Estrotone</h2><p>This herbal supplement is formulated for use during menopause, and pre- and post-menopause. Reviewers say it does wonders for managing hot flashes thanks to its blend of ingredients including black cohosh, chaste tree extract, evening primrose oil, schizandra, and more. One study found that chaste tree extract (<em>Vitex agnus-castus extract</em>) helps alleviate menopausal symptoms overall while another study determined that schizandra (<em>Schisandra chinensis</em>) helps manage menopause symptoms—hot flashes and sweating in particular.</p><p><strong>What the reviews say:</strong> “Wow! I’m really impressed. A week after I began taking this daily my hot flashes are completely gone. Completely. Gone. I was expecting a best case scenario where they were less frequent or less intense, but they have completely disappeared. I’m shocked and a huge fan of this product. I believe I had the onset of menopause six months ago and began experiencing hot flashes up to half a dozen per day, some mild, some more intense. I thought I’d see if a natural remedy would improve symptoms—and this surpassed my expectations. Just wow. It’s definitely worth trying. I will certainly repurchase it given my results.”</p><h2>Women’s Balance Hair Growth Supplement</h2><p>Hair thinning can be a side effect of menopause, although it’s not discussed as often as symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats. Nutrafol’s Women’s Balance Hair Growth Supplement is specifically designed to help combat thinning hair thanks to ingredients like biotin and selenium, which are linked to the prevention of hair loss under certain circumstances. Research conducted by Nutrafol found that 93% of women who used the supplement felt their hair looked healthier after six months. </p><p> <strong>What the reviews say</strong>: Shared one fan: “I’m on my 2nd bottle and I can definitely see the difference. I have always had thick hair—I am a woman of color—and as soon as the perimenopause started, the effects were almost immediate. Thinning hair seemed to happen overnight. I did my research and decided to give this a try. So far so good.”</p><h2>Women’s Balance</h2><p>Gaia Herbs works hard to ensure traceability in its supplement, giving you an herb ID so you can follow where the ingredients came from. The supplement is vegan and contains black cohosh, St. John’s wort, and vitex to help with hot flashes and hormonal balance. </p><p><strong>What the reviews say</strong>: Shared a fan: “I very rarely have hot flashes anymore and my mood feels very stable most of the time.”</p><h2>Meta-Balance</h2><p>Brain fog can happen with menopause. Pycnogenol, an herbal extract from European pine trees, in Meta-Balance has been linked to better attention and memory. The supplement may help with night sweats and hot flashes, along with skin elasticity. Thorne puts the supplements through several rounds of quality testing for purity and potency to ensure you’re actually getting what’s on the label. </p><p><strong>What the reviews say</strong>: “No more night sweats since taking this supplement. What a huge relief,” said a customer. “It’s worth every penny.”</p><h2>Every Woman's Multivitamin 55+</h2><p>This multivitamin designed for women 55+ contains herbs meant to target hormonal health and vitamins proven for maintaining overall health and wellness. This multivitamin contains vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as B vitamins, magnesium, and more. Plus, it’s formulated with a “hormone support blend” with herbal ingredients including chaste tree extract, red clover, and raspberry leaf.</p><p><strong>What the reviews say:</strong> “They don’t mention this in the packaging, but the moment I started taking this, my very pronounced hot flashes stopped. They used to be as frequent as 4 or 5 times an hour and intense. Now, they are mild and maybe once every couple of months. I also have more energy. Very pleased with these multivitamins.”</p><figure><img title="Every Woman's Multivitamin 55+" src="IMG/BB1ndjlU_every_womans_multivitamin_55.jpg" alt="Every Woman's Multivitamin 55+"><figcaption><em>Every Woman's Multivitamin 55+. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How to choose the best menopause supplements</h2><p>Consider these elements when choosing the best menopause supplement for yourself:</p><ul><li><strong>Ingredients. </strong>Women going through menopause need to have enough calcium and vitamin D for bone health, Dr. Minkin says. She suggests taking at least 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, and 1,000 to 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day. Dr. Streicher notes that supplements containing iron can be helpful for some women, especially those who don’t eat meat often or ever. Dr. Minkin adds that some herbs “do have some therapeutic value.” Black cohosh and rhapontic rhubarb are common herbal ingredients.</li><li><strong>Third-party testing</strong>. Supplements are regulated as food by the FDA, not as drugs. Third-party testing can help verify whats in your supplements and if they perform as advertised.</li><li><strong>Clinical studies</strong>. Not every supplement has this, but it’s a nice perk to have clinical research to show that a supplement does what it claims to do. </li></ul><h2>How long do menopause symptoms last?</h2><p>While menopause supplements can help manage your symptoms, you might be wondering exactly how long menopause and the accompanying symptoms usually last. </p><p>The length of menopausal symptoms can vary widely from woman to woman, Sarah de la Torre, M.D., board-certified ob/gyn, previously told <em>Prevention</em>. “In general, symptoms can last anywhere from a few months to several years,” she said. However, symptoms typically start during perimenopause—the period of time before menopause or the stop of your menstrual cycle—so if you are past that point, you may be looking at the end of the tunnel.</p><figure><img title="How long do menopause symptoms last?" src="IMG/AAWbTm9_how_long_do_menopause_symptoms_last.jpg" alt="How long do menopause symptoms last?"><figcaption><em>How long do menopause symptoms last?. Prevention</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How we chose the best menopause supplements</h2><p>We spoke with Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine and Lauren Streicher, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. We then looked at the most popular menopause supplements on the market and narrowed the field based on elements like ingredients, sourcing, and certifications. We also factored in reviews from real users to see how a range of women felt while taking these supplements. </p><figure><img title="How we chose the best menopause supplements" src="IMG/AAW0vuV_how_we_chose_the_best_menopause_supplements.jpg" alt="How we chose the best menopause supplements"><figcaption><em>How we chose the best menopause supplements.
