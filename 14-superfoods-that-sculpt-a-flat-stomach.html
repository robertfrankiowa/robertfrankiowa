    <main><h1>14 Superfoods That Sculpt a Flat Stomach</h1><p>Superfoods are big news, including in the weight management world. </p><p>What are 'superfoods,' you may ask? 'Superfood' is not a scientifically recognized term, and there are no set criteria. However, foods with this label tend to be rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Antioxidants take center stage for good reason. They protect our cells from oxidative stress from free radicals at large in the body. Think of free radical damage as 'cell rust,' like what happens to metal left to the elements. The 'rust' is what may lead to problems down the road (like cancer). Many superfoods contain fiber, protein, or heart-protective fats as well.</p><p>Here, using my background as a Registered Dietitian for Top Nutrition Coaching, I'll focus on superfoods linked to fat loss, including belly fat (visceral fat, a harmful type when in excess). Let's dig in (pun absolutely intended)!</p><h2>1 Kale and Other Dark Green Leafy Vegetables (Swiss Chard, Collards, Mustards, Spinach)</h2><p>Green leafy, like kale, is loaded with Vitamins A, C, and K, along with fiber, calcium, and other minerals. Eating spinach regularly may cut your risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and excess weight, thanks to its antioxidants and fiber content. Greens keep your digestion chugging along with their insoluble fiber–helpful in preventing a bloated belly.</p><figure><img title="1 Kale and Other Dark Green Leafy Vegetables (Swiss Chard, Collards, Mustards, Spinach)" src="IMG/BB1nxt6J_1_kale_and_other_dark_green_leafy_vegetables_swiss_chard_collards_mustards_spinach.jpg" alt="1 Kale and Other Dark Green Leafy Vegetables (Swiss Chard, Collards, Mustards, Spinach)"><figcaption><em>1 Kale and Other Dark Green Leafy Vegetables (Swiss Chard, Collards, Mustards, Spinach). © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Berries (Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Blackberries…)</h2><p>Rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. Studies have indicated that eating berries regularly can greatly reduce inflammation levels in the body. Inflammation is associated with excess belly fat, among other things. The fiber and larger volume you get in a serving of berries are satisfying and help prevent excess hunger later. With the fiber on board, you don't get the blood sugar crash, meaning there is less chance of rebounding food cravings that tend to follow unstable blood sugar patterns. </p><figure><img title="2 Berries (Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Blackberries…)" src="IMG/BB1nxt6P_2_berries_blueberries_raspberries_strawberries_blackberries.jpg" alt="2 Berries (Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Blackberries…)"><figcaption><em>2 Berries (Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Blackberries…). © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Beans, Pulses, and Soluble Fiber</h2><p>These are sources of low-fat protein and soluble fiber, which likes to grab onto cholesterol in the gut and escort it right on out of the body. To fully earn that 'superfood' status, beans and pulses contain antioxidants. Those with the highest antioxidant abilities include yellow peas, green peas, chickpeas, soybeans, lentils, and red kidney beans.Beans and pulses are rich in soluble fiber. Soluble fiber absorbs a lot of water in the gut. It slows down the rate at which our stomach empties after eating and causes the stomach to expand (feel full). Thus, we are satisfied longer after eating. Soluble fiber also cuts down on the amount of calories the body can absorb from food.A 2-year longitudinal study in Japan found that eating more soluble fiber could be linked with less belly fat. These fibers help trigger the release of gut hormones that signal you've had enough to eat. They are a source of energy for your gut microbes and the cells that line the inside of your intestines. (Again, our gut bacteria control a lot. Seriously. Keep them happy.)  Fiber can also range from 0-2 usable calories per gram, compared to the standard 4 calories per gram of other carbohydrates. </p><h2>4 Whole Grains</h2><p>Whole grains are essentially the whole, intact grains from the plant. They are not stripped of the outer bran during processing. When left intact, grains have similar nutrient profiles to beans & pulses—though the protein is a bit less. Stripping grains results in refined grains, which are softer and more uniform. Refined grains (aka, all-purpose or white flour) can more quickly spike blood sugar levels after eating and are associated with insulin resistance, excess weight, and type 2 diabetes. The insoluble fiber in whole grains also helps curb hunger and aids in ridding waste from the body. Whole grains include quinoa (not technically a grain, but it acts like one), whole oats, bulgur, whole wheat, and more.Fiber-rich foods also lead to more chewing, which in and of itself signals to the body that nutrients are coming in, and digestion can begin. If you've ever been hungry shortly after having a protein drink as your meal, this may be a culprit. Your brain needs physical stimulation from eating. </p><h2>5 Heart-Healthy Fats</h2><p>Heart-healthy fats, particularly the monounsaturated type, are found in foods like olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Diets high in these may be linked to lower body weight. The Mediterranean diet is an example of a diet high in these fats, and it's been linked to many health benefits.Compared to less-healthy saturated fats found in animal foods like butter and red meat, unsaturated fatty acids promote energy usage (aka, metabolism), diet-induced thermogenesis (creation of heat), and fat oxidation (breaking down of stored body fat). This would explain why a diet that includes a high amount of unsaturated fatty acids is less prone to cause weight gain. There is evidence showing that replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats leads to weight loss and lower fat mass.In the monounsaturated fat category, one notable superstar is the humble avocado. Various studies13have found that feelings of hunger were significantly less when adding avocado to a meal. This is to be expected with the fat and fiber avocados contain. The studies have also found that insulin production was less. We know that fat is a strong driver of releasing the digestive hormones GLP-1 (aka, what the current popular injectable medications for weight loss help maintain) and PYY. Both of these hormones signal to the brain that adequate nutrition has been consumed (aka, you get full and stay full), and blunt the drive to eat (less appetite). </p><figure><img title="5 Heart-Healthy Fats" src="IMG/BB1lgoZW_5_heart_healthy_fats.jpg" alt="5 Heart-Healthy Fats"><figcaption><em>5 Heart-Healthy Fats. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Cinnamon</h2><p>Cinnamon, with its naturally sweet flavor and antioxidants, has been found to cut back on sugar cravings, and is associated with better control of blood sugar in diabetes. It enhances the action of proteins that are involved with sugar (glucose) transport and the insulin signaling pathway. Insulin is a hormone involved in storing blood sugar and storing body fat. The distinct smell and flavor of cinnamon come from an oily substance that has large amounts of cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde is thought to be why cinnamon works the way it does.</p><figure><img title="6 Cinnamon" src="IMG/BB1nxv9v_6_cinnamon.jpg" alt="6 Cinnamon"><figcaption><em>6 Cinnamon. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Green Tea</h2><p>Green tea, packed with antioxidants,inhibits the action of the enzymes lipase, amylase, and glucosidase. Enzymes help the body break down foods and nutrients into smaller pieces, which is needed for proper absorption. Green tea works by preventing enzymes from doing their job in the gut. Stopping the enzyme lipase from working means less fat is absorbed from the foods we eat. The compound EGCG and caffeine are the primary working components of green tea. They possess a wide range of activities in the body, including weight loss. </p><h2>8 Coffee, Caffeine & Chlorogenic Acids</h2><p>Coffee contains the antioxidant chlorogenic acid. To date, it has been found in studies (23,24,29)to contribute to calorie and fat burning, along with the activation of brown fat. Brown fat is considered a healthy type of fat and is darker in color. Brown fat is smaller in size (takes up less space) and is packed with energy-producing cells (mitochondria), and it burns calories. </p><h2>9 Ashwagandha</h2><p>This plant has a long history of being used as an adaptogen in ayurvedic medicine. An adaptogen is a substance thought to help the body handle stress better. We know that chronic stress often leads to changes in eating behaviors and food choices, including the drive to eat more. This is due to the hormone cortisol, which kicks in for that fight-or-flight response in times of stress. Cortisol is known to increase hunger and sweet cravings.Ashwagandha contains several active components that are anti-stress, and extracts of the root offer major anxiety-reducing properties in humans, due to its GABA-like activity in the brain. (GABA is an amino acid-based messenger in the central nervous system, and reduces 'excitement' in the system.) Ease the body's stress response and thus coping behaviors like overeating. Choudhary and others found in their double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 52 subjects over 8 weeks that treatment with Ashwagandha extract resulted in subjects reporting much lower perceived stress scores vs baseline. This mimics findings from another study where stress-related food cravings, reactive eating, serum cortisol levels, and body weight were all less. For safety: If you're thinking of trying it, please check to make sure it doesn't interact with any medications or other supplements you are taking.</p><h2>10 Wine (the Resveratrol Part)</h2><p>Resveratrol acts as an antioxidant and is found in berries, nuts, red grapes, and products made with them (ahem, wine or juice). It has been popular for heart health for a while now. In recent years, we've learned that resveratrol is a strong activator of SIRT-1, a protein that helps protect against aging-related metabolic diseases (including those related to blood sugar use in the body). It mimics the effects of restricting food intake by regulating the body's response to fasting, calorie restriction, and exercise. Getting resveratrol from a dietary supplement is fraught with issues, including low absorption and activity in the body. (Getting it from a pill vs the food itself affects the body's ability to absorb and use it.) Further clinical trials are needed so we can better understand everything resveratrol can do and how best to apply it to health. In the meantime, if you happen to enjoy an occasional glass of red wine or snacking on some red grapes or berries, it may support weight loss efforts. </p><h2>11 Flaxseed</h2><p>Flaxseed is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid), fiber, and lignans. (Lignans are the waterproof "backbone" material for plants and provide structure, support, and protection.) It's also a great source of quick fiber when added to recipes or other foods. (Recall that fiber = enhanced meal satisfaction.) The lignans from flaxseed are reported to reduce belly fat and increase fat oxidation (burning) and adiponectin levels in a study on mice. Adiponectinsare released by fat cells and are involved in managing sugar levels, fat usage, and insulin sensitivity. It has an anti-inflammatory effect and is an antioxidant. Win!In a large review of 45 randomized, controlled trials, significant weight loss was observed in those eating more than 30 grams (3 tablespoons) of flaxseed per day over 12-week periods and in those of a higher weight range. Scientists suggest that the higher fiber content or other compounds present in flaxseed are responsible for the weight change, and trial results seem to highlight a cumulative effect over time. (The longer you use it and the more consistent you are with it, the more effect you might experience.) This is thought to be related to the active parts of the plant needing to build up in the body tissues over time. </p><h2>12 Conjugated Linolenic Acid (CLA)</h2><p>Research on CLA (a group of polyunsaturated fatty acids found naturally in meat and dairy products of cud-chewing animals) suggested a link with smaller fat cell size, less ability to make more fat tissue, browning of fat tissue, and changes in gut bacteria. Thus, CLA may be supportive of fat loss and a leaner midsection. It's not exactly a superfood, per se, but it's still part of the conversation.</p><h2>13 Diacylglycerol (DAG)</h2><p>"Dia-what?" you might ask. DAGis a natural part of many edible oils, like canola. It acts differently than similar types of fats (like triglycerides) because it has a different structure. It has been noted to enhance fat oxidation in animal models. When paired with ALA (see previous section), it resulted in excellent outcomes for body weight and belly fat loss. Cooking with canola oil would be a way to include DAG in your day-to-day eating.</p><h2>14 Summing It Up</h2><p>As you can see from the sheer variety of foods and nutrients that support fat loss, there are some common themes: fiber/gut health, antioxidants, and healthy fats that seem to pop up frequently. Some have a direct effect. Others are indirect. Consistency over time is also important. In general, it's the effect of multiple compounds in the food working together. Even if you're not consuming these foods or plant compounds for the benefit of fat loss, they still offer major health benefits…so enjoy!
