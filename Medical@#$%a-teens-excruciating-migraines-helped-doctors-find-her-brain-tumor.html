    <main><h1>A teen's excruciating migraines helped doctors find her brain tumor</h1><p>On vacation in 2014, Kaycie Kraus, then 14, experienced a severe migraine with an aura that wouldn’t dissipate. Her mom took her to the emergency room, and doctors recommended the family follow up with a neurologist, who ordered scans of her brain. The results felt stunning — she had a brain tumor.</p><p>“(We) got an MRI, which revealed the pilocytic astrocytoma that Kaycie had in her midbrain,” Kristi Kraus, 53, Kaycie Kraus’ mom, tells TODAY.com. “It hit hard for us because there was no good choice for … treatment.” </p><figure><img title="Courtesy Kaycie Kraus" src="IMG/BB1pemr4_when_kaycie_kraus_was_14_she_was_diagnosed_with_a_benign_brain_tumor_if_it_continued_to_grow_she_could_lo.jpg" alt="When Kaycie Kraus was 14 she was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor.

In many cases, doctors can remove them. But Kaycie Kraus wasn’t a candidate because of where her tumor was located. </p><p>Devastated by the lack of options, the family learned about laser ablation, which would stop the tumor’s growth without risky surgery or numerous rounds of chemotherapy. A decade later, Kaycie Kraus and her family feel relieved they found a doctor that offered her this treatment and a healthy life. </p><p>“There is still residual tumor there. It’s not completely gone,” Kristi Kraus says. “But it’s inactive at the moment.”</p><h2>Migraines lead to tumor diagnosis</h2><p>During puberty, Kaycie Kraus began experiencing excruciating migraines with auras. </p><p>“The migraines were definitely weird for me because they just came out of nowhere,” the now 24-year-old from St. Louis tells TODAY.com. “I never had them before, so that was obviously scary.” </p><p>The worst one hit while she was on vacation, and she avoided the sun and beach in the hopes of easing her pain.</p><p>“I was in a dark room,” she says. “It would not go away. It was all day long. I was scared.” </p><p>After returning home and following up with a neurologist, she received her diagnosis in December 2014. </p><p>“The brain tumor wasn’t causing the headaches,” Kristi Kraus says. “It was a coincidence that we found the brain tumor that was potentially going to continue to grow and cause deficits like weakness on the right side of her body.”</p><p>Kaycie Kraus says having a brain tumor felt “scary,” but she “was mainly just trying to remain positive.” </p><p>The family began exploring treatment options, and Kaycie Kraus visited the nearby children’s hospital. Surgery wasn’t an option because of where the tumor sat in her brain, and the hospitals' tumor board, a group of cancer doctors who help decide on treatment for certain cases, recommended chemotherapy. </p><p>But she felt wary about undergoing a treatment that might not even successfully stop the tumor from growing. Doctors also said she might have to go through chemotherapy multiple times throughout her life to keep the tumor in check. As an athlete and equestrian, she worried that being ill from chemotherapy side effects would stop her from enjoying the hobbies she loved. </p><p>“I was scared I was going to be sick for however long it took,” Kaycie Kraus says. “We definitely wanted to explore different options.” </p><figure><img title="Courtesy Kaycie Kraus" src="IMG/BB1pef84_kristi_kraus_was_a_strong_advocate_for_daughter_kaycie_kraus_when_she_was_grappling_with_a_brain_tumor_an.jpg" alt="Kristi Kraus was a strong advocate for daughter Kaycie Kraus when she was grappling with a brain tumor and its treatment options.

At the time, it wasn’t a widely used treatment, and they needed to find a doctor to do it. A local doctor could do it but agreed that Kaycie Kraus should receive chemotherapy. </p><p>“The tumor board decided that she should just do the traditional chemo, which is what they would ordinarily prescribe for somebody with a brain tumor,” Kristi Kraus says. “We weren’t going to just settle for that.” </p><p>Kristi Kraus began researching and found a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Gene Barnett, who agreed to perform laser ablation on Kaycie Kraus. The family traveled to Cleveland in April 2015 for the procedure.</p><p>While the laser ablation went well, recovery felt tough. When Kaycie Kraus awoke, she thought her head was “10 times the normal size.” </p><p>“That’s what it felt like to her,” Kristi Kraus says. “She had a lot of anxiety about that, but I just kept reassuring her that her head is not huge. It’s a normal size.” </p><p>While the first 12 hours following surgery were challenging, Kaycie Kraus began feeling better. </p><p>“Pretty soon after that, my dad took me on a walk,” she says. </p><p>The family feels grateful that Kaycie Kraus could undergo laser ablation. </p><p>“It was a very difficult procedure for her … but it was a much better, easier recovery (than brain surgery),” Kristi Kraus says. “She recovered well without deficits.” </p><h2>Laser ablation for brain tumors </h2><p>While Kaycie Kraus’ brain tumor was considered benign, where it was located made it difficult to treat. If left unchecked, she could have experienced trouble moving the right side of her body, Barnett says.</p><p>“It's in place that’s really surgically inaccessible with conventional techniques,” Barnett, director of Cleveland Clinic’s brain tumor and neuro-oncology center, and Kaycie Kraus' doctor, tells TODAY.com. </p><p>Her tumor rested in her midbrain next to important nerves. </p><p>“The nerve bundle that allowed her to move her right side was immediately adjacent to this tumor,” Barnett says. “So close, in fact, that when she had her biopsy... she had weakness in her right side for months.” </p><figure><img title="Courtesy Kaycie Kraus" src="IMG/BB1pejVz_when_doctors_suggested_that_kaycie_kraus_undergo_chemotherapy_to_try_to_treat_her_brain_tumor_she_felt_he.jpg" alt="When doctors suggested that Kaycie Kraus undergo chemotherapy to try to treat her brain tumor, she felt hesitant because she worried it would keep her from hobbies she enjoyed.

A precise treatment was needed.</p><p>“(Laser ablation) was really her best option,” Barnett says. “There are really no known latent side effects of this procedure.” </p><p>Stereotactic laser ablation, or more simply, laser ablation, relies on laser and MRI to target a tumor with high temperatures to make it inert, Barnett says. </p><p>“It uses the principle that if you heat tissue up to a high enough temperature, long enough, that you’ll kill it regardless of whether it’s good or bad tissue,” Barnett says. </p><p>After doctors make a hole in the skull about a quarter of an inch around, they use a laser directed at the tumor and a special type of MRI. The MRI allows doctors to monitor the effects of the laser while using a computer that predicts how the tissue is becoming. This enables doctors to make sure they’re killing the bad tissue, the tumor, and sparing the healthy tissue. </p><p>Kaycie Kraus' procedure went well, but it took time to see if it worked. </p><p>“The tumor itself got a little big larger. It’s not uncommon actually that there’s some swelling that occurs in these cases,” Barnett says. “Over the years, it has gotten progressively smaller in size, and even to this day, it’s getting somewhat smaller.” </p><p>While Barnett anticipates this trend to continue, if Kaycie Kraus’s tumor begins growing again, they can perform laser ablation on it a second time. </p><p>“It’s very rewarding to have been a part of her journey,” Barnett says. </p><h2>Advocating for your health</h2><p>Kaycie Kraus shares her story to encourage others facing difficult diagnoses. </p><p>“(I hope) people in similar situations to mine just have hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel and remain positive and strong,” she says. </p><p>For Kristi Kraus, she wants others to learn the importance of advocating for your health. </p><p>“It’s important to get as many opinions as you can,” she says. “You really need to explore all the options.” </p><p>Kaycie Kraus feels grateful for how her parents dedicated so much time in speaking up for her. </p><figure><img title="Provided by TODAY" src="IMG/BB1pef7X_a_teens_excruciating_migraines_helped_doctors_find_her_brain_tumor.jpg" alt="A teen's excruciating migraines helped doctors find her brain tumor"><figcaption><em>Today Kaycie Kraus lives with her dogs, horses and chickens and feels grateful for a healthy life.

The treatment options all seemed like they’d leave Kaycie Kraus with lingering health problems, and at times she and her husband Mike Kraus weren’t sure what to do. </p><p>“It was the most excruciating time,” she says. “We really felt like we had to advocate for our daughter to find the very best possible treatment.” </p><p>Their persistence paid off, and Kaycie Kraus enjoyed a healthy teenage life. She graduated from Maryville University in St. Louis last spring with a business degree. Since undergoing her surgery, she has continued to ride horses and is hoping to find a job where she can use her degree. </p><p>“I’m enjoying life to the fullest,” she says.</p></main>
