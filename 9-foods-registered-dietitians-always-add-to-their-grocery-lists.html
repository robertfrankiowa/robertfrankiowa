    <main><h1>9 Foods Registered Dietitians Always Add to Their Grocery Lists</h1><p>If you’ve ever wondered what a dietitian would choose when shopping for their weekly meals, now you can find out. Get a glimpse into the grocery carts of three dietitians as they share which foods they prioritize buying each week and how they can help your weight loss journey.</p><h2>1. Edamame</h2><p>Edamame is a budget-friendly and high-quality plant-based protein, according to Chelsea LeBlanc, RDN, owner of Chelsea LeBlanc Nutrition in Nashville, Tennessee. Research shows that protein aids weight loss by helping you feel full and maintain muscle. And when it comes to protein, edamame packs a powerful punch, at 18 grams (g) of protein per cup, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>LeBlanc likes to add edamame to salads, stir-fries, wraps, or grain bowls for an easy boost of protein. “Simply run it under cold water to quickly defrost, and it’s ready,” she says.</p><h2>2. Greens</h2><p>The benefits of greens include healthy vision, immunity, bone health, and cell growth, says Jenny Beth Kroplin, registered dietitan and lifestyle wellness expert of In Her Haven. And research confirms this: According to a study, eating green leafy vegetables lowers your risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, which are conditions often associated with obesity, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). In fact, the AHA also projects that by 2050, obesity rates will increase from 43.1 to 60.6 percent, stroke will rise from 3.9 to 6.4 percent, and coronary heart disease will increase from 7.8 to 9.2 percent.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>“I love to eat greens each day, either as a meal or as a side,” says Kroplin. Registered dietitian Sophie Dolan, owner of Sophie Dolan Nutrition in Birmingham, Alabama, is also a fan of dark leafy greens. She often adds spinach or arugula to pasta, sandwiches, or smoothies, and shares this healthy hack on her Instagram page: Add spinach to a colander, then drain your cooked pasta on top of it. This instantly steams the spinach, so you can mix it right into your pasta for a burst of extra nutrition with minimal effort.</p><h2>3. Beans</h2><p>“Beans deliver the perfect trifecta of fiber, protein, and delicious taste,” says LeBlanc. Research suggests that by eating beans and peas instead of other proteins and refined grains, you can give your diet a nutrient-packed upgrade, with more fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium, and copper. The same study also noted that people consumed 10 percent fewer calories on average, supporting a calorie deficit needed for weight loss. Plus, it might even shrink your grocery bill — something LeBlanc has noticed, especially when cutting back on meat purchases.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>LeBlanc suggests swapping beans for meat in tacos. And Kroplin says she adds beans to soups, stews, salads, and dips or eats them as a main dish. “I keep black beans, northern white beans, chili beans, and kidney beans on hand,” she says.</p><h2>4. Greek Yogurt</h2><p>From supporting the immune system to helping build strong teeth and bones, Greek yogurt offers high-quality nutrients to improve your overall well-being, according to LeBlanc. Research suggests the vitamin D, calcium, protein, and probiotics in yogurt make it beneficial for preventing metabolic syndrome. LeBlanc’s rule of thumb is to aim for a brand of yogurt with at least 6 g of protein per serving to curb hunger, and less than 7 g of added sugar for optimal nutrition.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>“I use it in place of sour cream, blend it into smoothies, and even use it to whip up tasty dressings and dips,” LeBlanc says. Dolan likes that it can be eaten any time of day, from breakfast to snacks, and sometimes uses it as a replacement for mayonnaise.</p><h2>5. Cottage Cheese</h2><p>“Cottage cheese is having a moment, and for good reason,” says Kroplin. “It’s packed with protein, it’s a great dose of calcium for good bone health, and [cultured cottage cheese] carries active probiotic strains for healthy gut support,” she says. Research shows the probiotic strain in cultured cottage cheese, <em>Lactobacillus</em>, particularly supports weight loss, as well as another strain found in other foods, <em>Bifidobacterium</em>. Just be sure to check the product label, as most cottage cheese won’t have live and active probiotics unless the brand added them.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>Kroplin finds cottage cheese to be more versatile than most people realize. “I love to eat cottage cheese paired with fruit or vegetables, mix it in a smoothie, add it to scrambled eggs, or even make cottage cheese toast,” she says.</p><h2>6. Eggs</h2><p>Dolan champions eggs as an easy protein source in her weekly grocery haul. One large egg offers 6 g of protein and 71.9 calories, per the USDA. While eggs naturally contain cholesterol, enjoying up to seven eggs a week won’t heighten your risk of heart disease, per the Mayo Clinic — particularly if you don’t pair them with processed meats or cook them in butter. Furthermore, if you’re trying to lose weight, eggs are a low-calorie choice.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>“I suggest hard-boiling about five eggs each Sunday, so you have them for the week to add to breakfast or lunch,” says Dolan. For her, simple habits make boosting protein easy.</p><h2>7. Avocado</h2><p>If Kroplin is in the grocery store, she likely has avocados in her cart. Research has found that avocados have a similar fat profile to olive oil, yet they offer an additional benefit: fiber. “The fats in avocados also act as a nutrient booster by helping increase the absorption of nutrients such as vitamins A, D, E, and K,” Kroplin says, which UCLA Health supports. One study also suggests habitual avocado consumption may reduce adult weight gain.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>“The versatility of avocados is endless,” says Kroplin. (For real. You can even make brownies with them.) “Whether you love a good guacamole or avocado toast, it’s a budget-friendly, healthy-fat fruit that does the body good!”</p><h2>8. Berries</h2><p>LeBlanc, Kroplin, and Dolan all buy berries each week, noting their high antioxidant value. “Berries add a natural sweetness without extra sugar and are packed with fiber,” says LeBlanc. She doesn’t shy away from eating fresh or frozen varieties, noting that frozen berries have their own advantages, especially if they don’t contain added sugar or syrups. “They’re budget-friendly and picked and packed at peak freshness to lock in nutrients, making it easy to enjoy berries all year round,” she says. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also says in some cases, frozen foods can even have more vitamins and minerals compared to fresh, with 1 cup of mixed berries containing only about 60 calories, per the USDA. </p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It:</strong> Kroplin says she adds berries to yogurts, smoothies, and salads. She also uses them to make homemade popsicles and frozen fruit bark. (Bonus: Berries pair nicely with chia seeds to make a healthier jam.)</p><h2>9. Hummus</h2><p>Dolan says this savory spread is one of her must-buys each week. Research confirms that hummus adds good value to your diet by supporting blood sugar levels after meals, improving your fasting lipid levels like cholesterol, and even managing your appetite — which makes it easier to achieve a healthy weight. Plus, hummus is a calorie-conscious choice, with only 35 calories per tablespoon, according to the USDA.</p><p><strong>How RDs Eat It: </strong>“Hummus is a staple snack in my house,” says Dolan. Whether paired with whole wheat crackers or fresh raw vegetables, hummus keeps her full. Beyond snacking, Dolan suggests trying hummus as a mayonnaise substitute on sandwiches. You can also try enhancing it with flavors like pumpkin.</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Without even trying, these three dietitians crafted a grocery list encompassing all five food groups — protein, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and carbohydrates. Not only that, but each of these dietitian-approved grocery items is versatile, with simple ingredients and powerhouse nutritional benefits that support achieving a healthy weight.
