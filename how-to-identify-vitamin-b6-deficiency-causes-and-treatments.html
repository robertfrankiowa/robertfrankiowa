    <main><h1>How to identify vitamin B6 deficiency? Causes and treatments</h1><p>Vitamin B6 deficiency can show a variety of symptoms if not managed effectively. Also known as pyridoxine, vitamin B6 belongs to the B-complex group of vitamins. </p><p>This vitamin was discovered in 1932 and is involved in over 150 enzymatic reactions. These reactions play key roles in energy metabolism and immune functions.</p><p>Vitamin B6 deficiency is rare but concerning, especially if there's a deficiency of folate and vitamin B12 as well. The deficiency of vitamin B6 is common in smokers, obese people, alcoholics and pregnant women. </p><p>In this article, we bring you the signs and symptoms of pyridoxine deficiency along with the causes and available treatments.</p><h2>Vitamin B6 deficiency diseases</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Sportskeeda Health and Fitness" src="IMG/AA1gO9UG_deficiency_of_vitamin_b6_can_cause_anxiety_and_mood_swings_image_via_unsplashraj.jpg" alt="Deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause anxiety and mood swings.

After the age of 50, the recommended daily amount is 1.5 milligrams for women and 1.7 milligrams for men.</p><p>Deficiency of vitamin B6 can manifest in a combination of various symptoms and is usually associated with other deficiencies. Hence, deficiency-specific diseases cannot be listed.</p><p>Some of the conditions related to vitamin B6 deficiency are:</p><ul>   <li>seizures</li>   <li>high blood level of homocysteine</li>   <li>peripheral neuropathy</li>   <li>B6-related anemia</li>   <li>weakened immune system</li>   <li>depression, anxiety and irritability</li>   <li>glossitis, which is characterized by swollen, sore, smooth and inflamed tongue</li>   <li>Cheilosis, which is characterized by sore, red and swollen lips</li>  </ul><p>It has to be kept in mind that these diseases are not solely caused by vitamin B6 deficiency and also involve deficiencies of other vitamins and minerals at the same time. </p><p>A proper diagnosis involving blood tests and other procedures is required to identify the causes.</p><h2>Vitamin B6 deficiency symptoms</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Sportskeeda Health and Fitness" src="IMG/AA1gOc9v_an_inflamed_tongue_is_one_of_the_major_signs_of_b6_deficiency_image_via_unsplashalex_guillaume.jpg" alt="An inflamed tongue is one of the major signs of B6 deficiency.

The tongue may appear swollen, sore and red, and cracks may appear in the corners of the mouth and lips.</p><p>A deficiency of vitamin B6 may also cause inflammation of the skin. A numb and prickling sensation could be there on the hands and feet, too. Pyridoxine deficiency can also increase anxiety and irritability in some cases.</p><h2>Deficiency of vitamin B6 causes</h2><p>As vitamin B6 is present in many foods, deficiency generally does not occur due to lack of intake except in the case of severe malnutrition.</p><p>Vitamin B6 deficiency often occurs due to:</p><ul>   <li>Impaired absorption of food sources (in case of malabsorption disorders)</li>   <li>Alcohol use can reduce the absorption of vitamin B6</li>   <li>Loss of vitamin B6 in case the individual is undergoing regular hemodialysis</li>   <li>Use of medications that could lead to loss of vitamin B6 stored in the body</li>  </ul><p>Antiseizure drugs, isoniazid (used for tuberculosis), hydralazine (for high blood pressure), corticosteroids and penicillamine are among the drugs that could lead to the deficiency of vitamin B6.</p><h2>Vitamin B6 deficiency treatment</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Sportskeeda Health and Fitness" src="IMG/AA1gOjKf_supplementation_is_the_best_way_to_treat_vitamin_b6_deficiency_image_via_unsplashtowfiqu_barbhuiya.jpg" alt="Supplementation is the best way to treat vitamin B6 deficiency.

Significant sources of vitamin B6 include dried yeast, organ meats, whole-grain cereals, chicken, fish and legumes.</p><p>Supplementation should only be prescribed by a nutritionist or a doctor after proper diagnosis, though. </p><p>Supplements are available as oral capsules, tablets or liquids. The daily recommendations can be followed as dosage instructions, or the health professional might decide the dosage depending on the severity of the deficiency.</p><p><em>Indranil Biswas is a nutritionist and personal trainer with a diploma in dietetics and personal training with a specialization in sports nutrition and strength training.</em></p><p>What do you think of this story?
