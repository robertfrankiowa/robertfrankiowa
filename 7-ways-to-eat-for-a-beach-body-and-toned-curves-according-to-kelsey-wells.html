In a recent social media post, the fitness guru flaunts her amazing body on the Australian beach. "Last night I was looking through photos from my recent trip to Aus. I love these. I love the rainbow stairs. I love my long, dirty, fake hair lol. I love that I was having fun with friends and jumping in the air *literally* without a care. Free from worrying about who might be there or what people think," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps. How does Kelsey maintain balance in her life and diet? Body Network has the details on her nutrition plan.</p><figure><img title="7 Ways to Eat for a Beach Body and Toned Curves, According to Kelsey Wells" src="IMG/BB1o1BZU_7_ways_to_eat_for_a_beach_body_and_toned_curves_according_to_kelsey_wells.jpg" alt="7 Ways to Eat for a Beach Body and Toned Curves, According to Kelsey Wells"><figcaption><em>7 Ways to Eat for a Beach Body and Toned Curves, According to Kelsey Wells. kelseywells/Instagram</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1 She Is Focusing on Balance and Consitency</h2><p>"I believe a holistic approach to nutrition is healthiest — this means focusing on balance, consistency, and including all types of food (and treats) in moderation," Kelsey wrote in a blog detailing her diet. "One thing that I will never do is deprive myself of any of the food groups — including desserts! Food should never be a source of guilt, and I encourage you to adopt this philosophy and see how it changes your own relationship with food," she continued.</p><h2>2 Start from Small Changes</h2><p>"If you are considering adjusting the way that you eat, I strongly encourage you to make small, sustainable changes. Remember, it's what you do often that counts! A restrictive diet will NOT help you to reach your health and fitness goals and can be mentally unhealthy, too. The most important thing is that you are kind to yourself and allow yourself to nourish your body in the way that best fits into your lifestyle."</p><figure><img title="2 Start from Small Changes" src="IMG/BB1o1IIX_2_start_from_small_changes.jpg" alt="2 Start from Small Changes"><figcaption><em>2 Start from Small Changes. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Breakfast</h2><p>Kelsey eats breakfast at 7.30 am. "I'll usually have eggs — there are so many ways to cook them, and they are packed with goodness," she writes. "I like to scramble my eggs with mushrooms, vegetarian sausage, spinach and cheese, or add them to a breakfast burrito. If I know I'm not going to have time to cook breakfast, I'll prepare overnight oats the evening before, and top it with Greek yoghurt and berries. Oats are so nutritious, so this is perfect when I'm in a hurry! I sometimes add protein powder to my oats to make sure I'm meeting my protein requirements after a PWR workout."</p><h2>4 Morning Snacks</h2><p>"I always have healthy snacks to keep me satisfied between meals!" says Kelsey. "Around mid-morning, I'll generally opt for an iced latte or a choc protein smoothie. If I'm on-the-go, I'll have a protein bar or these homemade chocolate coconut protein bites with a latte to get me through until lunchtime. Sliced apple with almond butter is another delicious option that doesn't require any preparation and that I will take with me if I'm out and about."</p><h2>5 Lunch</h2><p>"My lunch varies between savory and sweet options — I really do have a sweet tooth, and I don't believe you should deny yourself in order to be healthy! One of the most important things that I learned during my own PWR journey was that eating in a healthy, balanced way means finding food that you can truly enjoy," writes Kelsey. "For me, this means if I do feel like something sweet I'll opt for a vanilla chia pudding made with soy milk, protein powder and topped with cinnamon and berries. If I'm in the mood for something savory, I might have a vegetarian black bean salad or this green barbeque chicken bowl. A turkey wrap is another favorite lunch of mine — or if I haven't time to prepare anything, I'll grab a protein shake and have it with some veggies dipped in buffalo sauce and cottage cheese or hummus."</p><figure><img title="5 Lunch" src="IMG/BB1o1DPm_5_lunch.jpg" alt="5 Lunch"><figcaption><em>5 Lunch. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 Afternoon Snack</h2><p>"I don't know about you, but I always need a little pick-me-up in between lunch and dinner! My afternoon snack is often an iced latte and protein bar, or fresh fruit with greek yoghurt and honey. If I'm at home, I often make a fruit smoothie with protein, like this strawberry and banana protein shake," she writes.  "I try to include either fruits or vegetables (or both!) in my afternoon snack to give my body the nutrition it needs to get through until dinner time."</p><h2>7 Dinner</h2><p>"Dinner time is family time in our house — and I sit down to eat with my husband and son as often as possible," says Kelsey. "In summertime, we'll have a light meal like chicken tacos or this protein-packed spinach salad. Anderson loves to help me make salads — he's becoming quite the little chef! Stir frys are also popular in our house, and in winter, I use my slow-cooker regularly. When you don't have heaps of time for cooking, the slow cooker is perfect — simply put it on, and come home to a ready made meal! This slow-cooker quinoa chili is a vegetarian meal that can be made from pantry staples and will suit most preferences."</p><figure><img title="7 Dinner" src="IMG/BB1o1IJl_7_dinner.jpg" alt="7 Dinner"><figcaption><em>7 Dinner. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Nighttime Snack</h2><p>"I always have one last snack before brushing my teeth in the evening — and this is when I might have a cookie, or a healthy version like homemade oatmeal chocolate-chip protein bites. If I'm still quite hungry, I'll have rice cakes topped with almond butter and banana, or avocado toast with a poached egg," Kelsey concludes.
