Provided by EatingWell</em></figcaption></figure><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Emily Lachtrupp, M.S., RD</strong><p>It seems as if there’s constantly a new study popping up warning about the dangers of ultra-processed foods. And while no self-respecting dietitian would recommend eating pizza, burgers, chips or doughnuts <em>all the time</em>, there are loads of processed and ultra-processed foods I couldn’t live without.</p><p>Really. While processed and ultra-processed foods get a bad name, there’s <em>lots </em>of confusion about what they really are—and aren’t—and how they impact our health. (More on this soon.) </p><p>Truth is, plenty of processed and even ultra-processed foods are super nutritious, not to mention convenient and affordable. And as much as I love to cook, I don’t have time to whip up every meal from scratch. So using certain processed foods like, say, canned salmon or shredded mozzarella, helps me get in and out of the kitchen faster while also providing hard-to-get nutrients I might otherwise miss out on. Because I don’t have to worry about them spoiling quickly, they also cut down on supermarket trips and food waste. </p><h2>What Are Ultra-Processed Foods, Really?</h2><p>Before we dive in, you might be surprised to learn that even nutritionists are confused about ultra-processed foods—and many are rethinking their place in a healthy, balanced diet. The reason has to do with the way processed foods are studied. Most research uses a classification system called NOVA to determine a food’s level of processing, assigning it to one of the following four groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Unprocessed or minimally processed foods: </strong>Largely whole foods such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices.</li><li><strong>Processed culinary ingredients: </strong>Ingredients added to food during cooking, such as sugar, salt, oil, butter, lard and honey.</li><li><strong>Processed foods:</strong> Minimally processed foods with added processed culinary ingredients, like canned vegetables, tomato sauce in a jar, cheese, fresh bread, bacon, canned beans and tofu.</li><li><strong>Ultra (or highly) processed foods: </strong>These contain multiple ingredients created via industrial processing, such as hydrogenated oils, high-fructose corn syrup, emulsifiers, artificial colors and protein isolates. Examples include veggie burgers, infant formula, oat and almond milk, packaged bread, breakfast cereals, frozen meals and pizzas, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, chocolate, ice cream, cookies and cakes.</li></ul><p>  When NOVA was introduced in 2009, most nutritionists took its guidance at face value. However, we’re now learning that NOVA contains some unexpected flaws and contradictions. It’s become so controversial, in fact, that recent research out of the <em>European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Nutrition Today </em>and <em>Advances in Nutrition </em>has questioned its accuracy and effectiveness. For example, some nutrient-rich foods have been unfairly categorized as ultra-processed foods.</p><p>And while there are many processed and ultra-processed foods that may not be great for us, there are plenty of others that can give you a nutritional boost. Keep reading for the ones you’ll always find in my kitchen:</p><h2>8 Dietitian-Approved Ultra-Processed Foods </h2><h3>1.     Whole-Grain Bread </h3><p>I was shocked to learn that NOVA lumps packaged whole-grain bread in the ultra-processed camp. But that’s not going to stop me from eating it. My favorite brands are made with a mix of fiber-rich whole grains, including whole wheat, oats, millet, rye and spelt, plus nutrient-packed seeds such as flax, sunflower, sesame and pumpkin seeds. The result? Two grams of satisfying fiber per slice of whole-grain bread, according to the USDA. </p><h3>2.     Lightly Sweetened Whole-Grain Cereal </h3><p>Topped with fruit and milk, whole-grain cereal is a complete meal that works for breakfast, a quick lunch or a nutritious snack (which is why I’ve been known to eat it several times a day!). Plus, many brands are fortified with nutrients many of us don’t get enough of, like iron, folic acid and vitamin D. That may be one reason cereal eaters tend to have better nutrition than non-cereal eaters, per a 2019 <em>Nutrients </em>study. Look for one that’s fiber-rich (roughly 6 grams per cup) and low in added sugars, ideally less than 8 grams per serving.</p><h3>3.     Peanut Butter </h3><p>Peanut butter is an easy way to work some heart-friendly plant protein into your day. But depending on whether it contains added hydrogenated oils and mono- and diglycerides, it can fall into the processed or ultra-processed bucket on the NOVA scale, explains the National Peanut Board. Being a less-is-more person, I tend to favor the additive-free varieties made from just peanuts and sea salt.  </p><h3>4.     Lightly Sweetened Greek Yogurt</h3><p>My fridge is filled with multiple types of Greek yogurt. There are large tubs of plain unsweetened yogurt for dips, tzatziki and parfaits, plus single-serve containers of lightly sweetened vanilla for a speedy post-workout protein fix. Technically, it’s “highly processed,” but it’s also an easy way to score gut-friendly probiotics, and my favorite lightly sweetened brand contains a reasonable 5 grams of added sugars.</p><h3>5.     Single-Serve Bags of Popcorn</h3><p>A single-serve bag of lightly sweetened kettle corn is my go-to when I need a quick snack on the run. It satisfies my craving for something sweet, salty and crunchy—all in one shot. According to the USDA, each serving delivers one-third of your daily whole-grain quota. Since sugar and salt can be all over the place, look for brands made from popcorn, vegetable oil and a hint of sea salt and sugar (for about 110 milligrams of sodium and 8 grams of added sugar).</p><h3>6.     Canned Beans </h3><p>From garbanzos to black beans to cannellini beans, canned beans could be one of the healthiest convenience foods around. After all, how many foods double as a vegetable <em>and </em>a protein? I’m a big fan of no-salt-added varieties. However, when they're unavailable, regular canned beans are still a win, especially since rinsing washes away more than 40% of their sodium, according to The Bean Institute.   </p><h3>7.     Trail Mix</h3><p>Go for mixes made from roasted nuts, dried fruit and maybe a little dark chocolate, and bypass those containing colorful candies, which can be swimming in artificial colors and added sugars. </p><p>For years, I felt obligated to make my own tomato sauce to avoid excess sodium and added sugar. Not anymore. Today, there are some exceptional gourmet sauces with zero added sugars and moderate sodium (look for those that limit sodium to 400 to 450 milligrams per serving). Not only is jarred sauce a huge timesaver, stocking up on sale can be less expensive than prepping your own from scratch.   </p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>When it comes to processed and ultra-processed foods, the key is to choose strategically. Sure, you’ll want to avoid nutritionally empty options laced with additives, preservatives, added sugars and salt. Yet, there are also hidden gems that deliver big nutritional payoffs. There’s another upside too. Because they help you get in and out of the kitchen quickly, they can free up precious time for other healthy habits, like a yoga class, a meditation session or a run!</p></main>
