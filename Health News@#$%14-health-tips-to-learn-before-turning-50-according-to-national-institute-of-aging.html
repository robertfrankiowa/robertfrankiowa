Somehow, we are all taught that the best years of our lives are during college or the early 30s, but this doesn’t have to be the case. The more we age, the wiser, more experienced, and skilled we become. The only thing that seems to worsen in our body, but luckily, there are plenty of tips you can adopt to slow down body aging. Here are 14 pieces of health advice everyone should adopt before turning 50, according to the National Institute of Aging.</p><figure><img title="14 Health Tips To Learn Before Turning 50, According To National Institute Of Aging" src="IMG/BB1pdFEK_14_health_tips_to_learn_before_turning_50_according_to_national_institute_of_aging.jpg" alt="14 Health Tips To Learn Before Turning 50, According To National Institute Of Aging"><figcaption><em>14 Health Tips To Learn Before Turning 50, According To National Institute Of Aging.

Although there is nothing wrong with treating yourself and indulging now and then, cutting down on high-calorie fast foods eliminates your diet of unnecessary processed foods and you feel better long term. </p><h2>Health Screenings</h2><p>Visiting your provider regularly for check-ups is a great task to add to your health routines to help maintain health in your 50s. It helps you monitor and maintain your body and keeps you up to date on vaccinations and health protocols. As you approach your 50s, you should become more conscious about monitoring for health issues associated with age. </p><h2>Be Mindful Of Caloric Intake</h2><p>Staying mindful of your caloric intake before you enter your 50s can help keep hormones that change with age regulated and preserve energy levels and muscle mass. Doing so is a small act that can help you stay in control of your health, manage your weight, and help reduce the risks of age-related health issues. </p><h2>Eat A Balanced Diet</h2><p>When you focus on eating a balanced diet that’s not oversaturated in one particular food group, you ensure your body continues to receive the proper nutrition it needs when you enter your 50s. A balanced diet typically consists of different fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. </p><h2>Refine Dietary Practices</h2><p>Refining your dietary practices doesn’t mean incessantly counting calories or restricting yourself from enjoying your favorite foods and allowing yourself to enjoy the comfort food brings you. It’s about knowing what your body needs per your health and goals. This can help you manage your weight, and therefore, the stress that your bones take on as you age. </p><h2>Ditch Bad Practices</h2><p>If you like to drink, smoke, party, eat out a lot, and practice other poor habits in your 40s – it may leave a lasting effect into your 50s and beyond. To state the obvious, the health of your skin and organs suffer from these habits. Normal wear and tear on the body throughout your life is inevitable but you can choose not to overindulge in activities that break the body down faster. </p><h2>Prioritize Physical Activity</h2><p>Prioritizing physical activity will help stress and tension in the body as you enter your 50s. Shoot for 150 minutes a week if you can fit it in, but any amount you can squeeze in is great. Swimming, walking, hiking, yoga, and other forms of physical activity will help keep your body fit and agile. </p><figure><img title="Prioritize Physical Activity" src="IMG/BB1nrEyK_prioritize_physical_activity.jpg" alt="Prioritize Physical Activity"><figcaption><em>Prioritize Physical Activity.

Try to create a bedtime routine that you can maintain that helps you wind down, relax, and prepare your mind and body for a night of rest. </p><h2>Stay Hydrated</h2><p>Being able to enter your 50s is a blessing and a pleasure, and keeping your body hydrated will help you feel more connected to the beauty and essence of this decade. Water keeps your skin hydrated, helping it look youthful and fresh, but it also supports important bodily functions that will need more aid as you age. </p><figure><img title="Stay Hydrated" src="IMG/BB1mCw4z_stay_hydrated.jpg" alt="Stay Hydrated"><figcaption><em>Stay Hydrated.

It’s an important mechanism in protecting your skin from sun spots and potentially harmful UV rays that can cause skin cancer. Utilize sunscreens, hats, sunglasses, etc., and avoid exposing your bare skin to the summer sun during peak hours. </p><h2>Add Brain-boosting Activities To Your Routines</h2><p>Challenging your brain every week can help keep you sharp going into your 50s. Your brain is a muscle, and just like all the other muscles in your body, it will start to decay if you don’t use it. Stimulating your brain activity will promote cognitive function and staying mentally engaged will enhance overall memory and focus. </p><h2>Maintain A Positive Outlook</h2><p>As you enter your 50s you want to maintain a positive mindset and outlook on life. Being thankful and practicing gratitude for the present moment will help keep your stress levels at bay and enhance your overall well-being. Keep yourself surrounded with positivity, optimism, and things that bring you joy and fulfillment. </p><figure><img title="Maintain A Positive Outlook" src="IMG/BB1mVuaG_maintain_a_positive_outlook.jpg" alt="Maintain A Positive Outlook"><figcaption><em>Maintain A Positive Outlook.

When feeling intense stress or anxiety, mindful activities can come to the rescue. For instance, you can try to keep a gratitude journal, annotating three things you are grateful for every day. Other practices, such as meditation, yoga, and journaling, can also be useful.</p><h2>Surround Yourself With Positive People</h2><p>Loneliness is also one of the main factors affecting people’s health, especially in recent years, when people seem to be lonelier than ever. Do you have a close circle of friends? Are there people you can call even at 3 a.m. in the morning in case of need? Similarly, make sure to distance yourself from people who only bring negativity into your life.</p><p>This article is inspired by tips on healthy aging from the National Institute on Aging. </p></main>
