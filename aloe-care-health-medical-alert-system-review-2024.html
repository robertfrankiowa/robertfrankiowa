    <main><h1>Aloe Care Health Medical Alert System Review 2024</h1><h2>Aloe Care Health</h2><p>Aloe Care Health is a new player on the medical alert system block that entered the market in 2020. However, the company is already making strides in the industry. Features like voice activation, no-fee pendant-free fall detection, and motion sensors make it the perfect system for older adults who want to embrace the latest tech. Of course, I had to get my hands on Aloe Care Health’s systems to see what all the buzz was about.</p><p>Aloe Care Health offers two in-home systems, one of which includes on-the-go protection with a stand-alone mobile device. For this review, my uncle and I tested out the Essentials Plus system. I have to admit that when shopping, I experienced some sticker shock. Aloe Care Health’s upfront prices are higher than most medical alert systems on the market. However, once I tested them, I quickly realized the protection and connection these high-tech systems provide make them well worth the investment.</p><h2>Overview of Aloe Care Health</h2><h3>The Buying Experience</h3><p>Purchasing an Aloe Care Health system was simple and quick. Compared to competitors we’ve reviewed like Medical Guardian, Aloe Care Health doesn’t have add-on equipment, multiple color options, or various subscription types, so you aren’t required to make multiple selections throughout the checkout process. It makes for a very smooth and uncomplicated transaction! If you’re more comfortable ordering over the phone instead of online, you have that option as well.</p><p><strong>Money-Saving Tip:</strong> Be on the lookout for promotions, as Aloe Care Health runs seasonal deals to help you save on your system! Right now, you can get free shipping on any order.</p><p>While browsing Aloe Care Health’s systems, I was curious to know if the Essentials Plus system offered fall detection. I also wanted to learn more about the package’s motion sensors. To get my questions answered, I reached out to customer support. A representative responded to my questions via the chat box on the website within a minute. You can also call customer support with questions. Many user reviews note that Aloe Care Health’s customer service reps are exceptional.</p><p>From my conversation with customer service, I learned that none of Aloe Care Health’s home systems have automatic fall detection, which was a bit disappointing. Most providers like Medical Guardian and Bay Alarm Medical offer in-home fall detection. Aloe Care Health used to sell a system called Total Care that offered in-home fall detection, but it has been discontinued.</p><h3>Setting Up My System</h3><h4>Smart Hub Setup</h4><p>I was excited to unpack my Aloe Care Health System once it arrived, and, by the way, shipping was free! I chose to test out the Smart Hub first. I found a Smart Hub, the Care Button, a power cord, a lanyard, and a wristband inside the box. I placed the Smart Hub in the living room on the coffee table, a central room in my house. You’ll want to place the Smart Hub on a flat surface that is about 3 to 4 feet high. Coffee tables, bedside tables, and kitchen counters work great. Once I plugged the device into the wall, it powered up automatically and chimed. The ring light on top pulsed blue.</p><p>Then, a voice prompted me to either download the smartphone app and follow the step-by-step directions or listen to the prompts for manual setup. I chose to set up my system through the app, which was a quick and easy process with clear directions. The system also comes with an easy-to-follow manual if you’d prefer to set up your system without the app.</p><p>All in all, it was fairly easy to set up my system. However, I could see the process being more challenging for someone who is less familiar with tech or smartphone apps. If you get stuck during the setup process, customer service is always available and happy to help!</p><p>After setup was complete, my uncle put the Care Button on his wrist and tested the emergency call system. We were pleasantly surprised to find that he was connected to an operator in just 10 seconds. The average response time for medical alert systems across the industry is about 15 to 45 seconds, so this was fast! My uncle let the operator know that he was just making a test call, and that was it. The whole process took less than five minutes, and we didn’t encounter any issues.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Senior Living" src="IMG/AA1jRt5a_unboxing_my_aloe_care_health_smart_hub.jpg" alt="Unboxing my Aloe Care Health Smart Hub"><figcaption><em>Unboxing my Aloe Care Health Smart Hub. Provided by Senior Living</em></figcaption></figure><p class="wp-caption-text">             Unboxing my Aloe Care Health Smart Hub           </p><h3>Mobile Companion Go Setup</h3><p>The on-the-go device, the Mobile Companion Go, came with the Essentials Plus system. The Mobile Companion Go includes a charger and strap to place it around your neck. To power it up, I pressed and held the gray power button on the side of the unit. The light at the top of the Mobile Companion turned green, the device buzzed, and I heard a chime. A voice told me that the unit was powering on. Then, I set the system on its charging cradle and plugged it in. After a quick charge, the unit was ready to go! To test it out, I pressed the large gray button in the center of the unit, and I was quickly connected to an operator. Again, the testing process was simple and fast.</p><p>One important note about the Mobile Companion Go system: It is only offered with the Essentials Plus package; you can’t purchase this mobile unit on its own. Instead, if you just want a mobile system, you can purchase the Mobile Companion 2.</p><h3>Contracts and Warranty</h3><p>Aloe Care Health doesn’t require long-term contracts. That means you can cancel at any time without penalty or extra fees. Unlike Medical Guardian’s prices, which offer a slight discount when you pay annually versus monthly, Aloe Care Health doesn’t offer discounts for paying ahead for service.</p><p>Like other popular providers we’ve reviewed, including Lively, Aloe Care Health offers a one-year limited warranty on their products.</p><h3>Aloe Care Health Systems at a Glance</h3><table>  <tr> <th>System name</th> <th>Equipment fee</th> <th>Monthly rate</th> <th>Type of protection</th> <th>What’s included</th> </tr>   <tr> <td>Essentials</td> <td>$199.99</td> <td>$39.99</td> <td>In-home</td> <td> <ul> <li>4G Smart Hub</li> <li>Wearable Care Button</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Essentials Plus</td> <td>$349.99</td> <td>$59.99</td> <td>In-home and on the go</td> <td> <ul> <li>4G Smart Hub</li> <li>Wearable Care Button</li> <li>Mobile Companion Go</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mobile Companion 2</td> <td>$149.99</td> <td>$44.99</td> <td>On the go with fall detection</td> <td> <ul> <li>Mobile Companion 2</li> <li>Automatic fall detection</li> <li>Live location tracking</li> <li>Two-way communication</li> <li>Outbound calls to a programmed caregiver</li> <li>Location detection for lost devices</li> </ul> </td> </tr>  </table><h2>Aloe Care Health System and Product Details</h2><h3>Essentials: Basic Protection</h3><h4>Cost</h4><h4>Equipment</h4><p>The Essentials system is Aloe Care’s most “basic” system, yet its state-of-the-art technology is far from basic. The Smart Hub is the star of the show. It’s a voice-activated smart speaker, which kind of looks like an Alexa or Google Home. The Smart Hub connects you to everyone you choose to include in your Care Circle. You can use it as a phone to call people within the Care Circle and to connect with a professional 24/7 emergency response team should the need arise. I tested the Smart Hub’s voice-activated feature by repeating the word “Emergency.” After I said this three times, the system automatically connected to the monitoring center. I love this hands-free feature!</p><p><strong>Quick Note:</strong> Aloe Care Health offers a free month of service for those in the military. </p><p>For extra protection around the house or in the yard, the system comes with a Care Button that you can wear around your neck or wrist. In an emergency, simply press your wearable button to connect to the monitoring center.</p><p>Unlike traditional medical alert systems from providers we’ve reviewed like Lifeline that are, well, a bit of an eyesore, Aloe Care Health’s equipment is very sleek. It looks like another fancy-schmancy speaker or piece of smart home equipment, which I appreciate! The Smart Hub also features a motion-activated night light. I loved this feature, as it helped me avoid tripping or bumping into things when I got up in the middle of the night.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Senior Living" src="IMG/AA1jRAuT_my_uncle_testing_out_the_aloe_care_health_smart_hub_and_help_pendant.jpg" alt="My uncle testing out the Aloe Care Health Smart Hub and help pendant"><figcaption><em>My uncle testing out the Aloe Care Health Smart Hub and help pendant. Provided by Senior Living</em></figcaption></figure><p class="wp-caption-text">             My uncle testing out the Aloe Care Health Smart Hub and help pendant           </p><h4>Service and Monitoring</h4><p>In addition to medical alert monitoring, the Aloe Care Health Smart Hub monitors air quality, temperature, and activity in the home and alerts caregivers if anything is out of the ordinary. The system uses 4G to connect wearers to the emergency monitoring system, so Wi-Fi is not required.</p><p>This at-home system is ideal for homebodies. Keep in mind that the Essentials system doesn’t include fall detection and it isn’t a feature you can add on. If you or your loved one has a history of falling, I’d recommend one of Aloe Care Health’s on-the-go systems with fall detection.</p><h3>Essentials Plus: At-Home and On-the-Go Protection</h3><h4>Cost</h4><h4>Equipment</h4><p>The Essentials Plus system includes all of the same equipment and features as the Essentials system, plus the Mobile Companion Go. This duo provides protection and monitoring in the home, while on its own, the Mobile Companion Go gives seniors protection outside the home.</p><p>The Mobile Companion Go is water-resistant and can be worn as a pendant. It has a battery that lasts up to five days before needing a charge; this is great for active seniors who want their medical alert system to travel with them! When worn around the neck, it can also detect falls. I was especially impressed with the device’s option for vibrational feedback to accommodate older adults with hearing loss and visual impairments.</p><h4>Service and Monitoring</h4><p>Providing both in-home and on-the-go monitoring, the Essentials Plus system is a great option for older adults looking for a sleek mobile system that includes fall detection. The Mobile Companion Go provides GPS monitoring and 24/7 access to professional emergency response using the nationwide AT&T LTE network. The built-in two-way speaker makes it easy for wearers to communicate with Aloe Care Health’s trained professionals in an emergency situation. I tested the Mobile Companion Go while running errands, and the system’s signal was strong enough to connect me to the monitoring system without any issues.</p><h3>Mobile Companion 2: Premium On-the-Go Protection</h3><h4>Cost</h4><h4>Equipment</h4><p>Mobile Companion 2 is an upgraded version of Mobile Companion Go that can be purchased on its own. It includes all of the same features, including a mobile unit, automatic fall detection, and a 4G LTE connection, plus a few extras. This system allows the user to make outbound calls to a programmed caregiver straight from the device, which is a great feature if you don’t have your phone on you. The Mobile Companion 2 also has a Find My Device feature, so you can find your system if you ever misplace it. This is excellent for older adults with memory loss or those who are just forgetful like me! If it fits in your budget, I’d highly recommend the Mobile Companion 2, as it offers the most robust on-the-go protection.</p><h4>Service and Monitoring</h4><p>Similar to Mobile Companion Go, Mobile Companion 2 runs on a 4G LTE connection. It offers 24/7 coverage and automatic fall detection. The mobile unit has live location detection, so you can locate your loved one in real time during an emergency. It’s also compatible with the Aloe Care Health mobile app for caregivers and loved ones who want to keep track of the user.</p><h2>Add-On Features and Accessories</h2><p>While Aloe Care Health doesn’t offer any traditional add-on features, all systems come with free access to the Aloe Care Health mobile app. This app puts the cherry on top of their systems. I easily downloaded it through the Apple App Store (it works on Androids, too). As you may have experienced yourself, many adult children pop in and check on their aging parents or rely on regular phone calls if they live far away. As a convenient alternative, the Aloe Care Health app allows adult children and caregivers to view multiple, real-time indicators through the app to get a picture of how their loved one is doing. You can say goodbye to those well-meaning, but a bit pestering, check-ins!</p><p>Those in the Care Circle can also use the app to call straight into the Smart Hub to chat. The calling feature works the other way as well; older adults can reach those in the Care Circle through the Smart Hub. It’s nice to know there’s another way to quickly get a hold of your friends and family if your phone is off or out of reach. Below, we’ll take a look at my favorite app features for caregivers.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Senior Living" src="IMG/AA1jRxK2_checking_in_on_the_aloe_care_health_app.jpg" alt="Checking in on the Aloe Care Health app"><figcaption><em>Checking in on the Aloe Care Health app. Provided by Senior Living</em></figcaption></figure><p class="wp-caption-text">             Checking in on the Aloe Care Health app           </p><ul> <li><strong>Temperature in the home</strong>: If the temperature is lower than usual, you’ll know whether your loved one’s heater is working correctly or if a window has been left open.</li> <li><strong>Air quality</strong>: The Smart Hub measures CO2 and VOC, so if there is a gas leak in your parents’ home, you can rest assured that you’ll be alerted through the app.</li> <li><strong>Mobility</strong>: Aloe Care Health’s motion sensors are connected to the app, so you’ll be alerted when mom is up and moving in the kitchen at 6:30 a.m., probably making her regular cup o’ joe.</li> <li><strong>System status</strong>: Here, you can tell if the Aloe Care Health system is working properly. If there is a power outage in the home, you’ll be notified that the system is running on its backup battery.</li> <li><strong>Check-ins</strong>: If you have multiple caregivers/adult children, you can all leave notes on the app when you check in with your loved one. That way, everyone is up to date and on the same page!</li> </ul><h2>The Bottom Line on Aloe Care Health </h2><p>Aloe Care Health is one of the most high-tech systems our team has reviewed over the years. Customer testimonials often commend the company for its innovative technology that provides peace of mind. Its motion sensors, robust caregiver app, and temperature and air quality sensors make it excellent for older adults who want the latest and greatest and caregivers looking to stay in the loop.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re looking for a more simple system without bells and whistles, we’d recommend looking elsewhere. I found the Smart Hub and caregiver app to be a solid duo that provides intuitive protection and connection. As long as the higher prices fit in your budget, Aloe Care Health is a top-notch, innovative provider leveraging technology to keep seniors safe and loved ones informed.</p><h2>Our Methodology</h2><p>As our team tests medical alert systems, we evaluate the key decision-making factors that users should consider when shopping for a system. These factors include reliability, ease of use, customer service, value for money, average response times, and a variety of features. We test every system for ourselves to give readers a hands-on look at the product. Whenever possible, we also receive feedback from older adults (like my uncle!) about the systems. Then, we use all of our research and experience with the products to give each company a star rating out of five, making it easy for readers to compare systems.
