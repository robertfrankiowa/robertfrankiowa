    <main><h1>Signs and Symptoms of Insomnia</h1><p>Insomnia is a common but complex sleep disorder that causes trouble falling asleep (called sleep initiation insomnia) or staying asleep (called sleep maintenance insomnia). The condition leads to poor sleep quality and duration.</p><p>It's common for insomnia to occur in cycles, with alternating periods of sleep loss and periods of sufficient sleep. While most people have occasional sleepless nights, those with insomnia may experience frequent symptoms at night and during the day. Over time, persistent symptoms may lead to problems with daily functioning and increase your risk of other health conditions.</p><p>The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM-V) defines insomnia as having nighttime symptoms at least three nights per week for at least three months. To be officially diagnosed with insomnia, people must also have daytime symptoms that affect their ability to function while awake.</p><p>Anyone can develop insomnia, but the condition is more common among people assigned female at birth, older adults, and those with underlying mental health disorders or other medical conditions.</p><h2>Types of Insomnia</h2><p>Experts recommend that adults get at least seven hours of sleep per 24-hour period. They recommend between 8 and 16 hours of sleep, depending on age, for young children and teenagers. But, people with insomnia are not able to get their recommended amount of sleep. This problem can last for a few days up to a lifetime.</p><h3>Acute Insomnia</h3><p>Acute (short-term) insomnia is a period of sleep problems that lasts between a few days and three months. Sleep troubles are generally the result of a specific stressor or temporary event in your life, like work stress or the loss of a loved one. When the stressor passes, the sleep troubles usually resolve. However, sometimes they persist and turn into chronic insomnia.</p><h3>Chronic Insomnia</h3><p>Chronic (long-term) insomnia is a period of sleep disruption that lasts for three months or more. This type of insomnia can last for years, often occurring on and off. It may begin as a result of persistent stress, medical condition, or substance use, or the cause may be unknown. Experts estimate that 10% to 15% of adults experience chronic insomnia.</p><h2>Nighttime Insomnia Symptoms</h2><p>The main symptoms of insomnia occur at night (or during the primary sleep window for those who sleep at other times). People with insomnia may have trouble:</p><ul><li><strong>Falling asleep:</strong> Most people without insomnia fall asleep within 10 to 20 minutes of lying down and trying. People with sleep initiation insomnia may take 30 minutes or more to fall asleep. This symptom is particularly common in younger adults.</li><li><strong>Staying asleep:</strong> People with sleep maintenance insomnia may wake up and fall back to sleep several times during the night. They may also sleep for a few hours and then be unable to fall back to sleep after waking the first time. They are typically awake for more than 30 minutes throughout the night.</li><li><strong>Waking up early:</strong> Some people with insomnia experience early waking. This means they wake up at least 30 minutes before they want to. </li></ul><h2>Daytime Insomnia Symptoms</h2><p>Symptoms that occur during the daytime (or during the primary awake window) typically stem from the nighttime symptoms above. In general, getting less sleep can lead to trouble functioning during the day. Daytime symptoms may include:</p><ul><li>Sleepiness or fatigue</li><li>Trouble concentrating or paying attention</li><li>Changes in performance at school or work</li><li>Mood changes, such as irritability or anxiety</li><li>Lack of motivation or energy</li><li>Making more mistakes</li><li>Having more accidents</li><li>Hyperactivity or impulsivity</li><li>Constant worry about sleep</li></ul><h2>Long-Term Insomnia Complications</h2><p>Chronic insomnia often either leads to or results from other health problems. While the direction of causation (meaning, which condition causes the other) can sometimes be unclear, conditions that commonly occur alongside insomnia include:</p><ul><li>Other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome</li><li>Mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety</li><li>Substance use disorder </li><li>Neurologic disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease</li><li>Lung and heart disease</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Cancer</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>Chronic pain</li></ul><h2>Symptoms in Women</h2><p>Insomnia affects more people assigned female at birth than assigned males. More than one-fourth of people assigned female at birth experience insomnia symptoms at some point in their lives. The reasons for this difference may be linked to the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Hormones: </strong>People who menstruate, become pregnant, and experience menopause have significant hormonal changes during these times. Shifts in their hormones can lead to insomnia symptoms.</li><li><strong>Health conditions: </strong>People assigned female at birth have higher rates of certain health conditions that are associated with insomnia, such as fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety.</li></ul><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Getting a sufficient amount of good-quality sleep is an extremely important part of your overall well-being. Proper sleep allows the brain and body to remove toxins and repair itself in ways it cannot during waking hours.</p><p>Not getting enough sleep, known as sleep deprivation, can impair your ability to function well during the day. Lack of sleep also makes you more likely to be involved in accidents. And long-term sleep deprivation can increase your risk of developing serious health conditions like diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and stroke.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing persistent sleep difficulties, talk to your healthcare provider. Addressing the underlying causes and adopting healthy sleep habits may help you manage insomnia and improve your quality of life.</p><p>Your healthcare provider may have you keep a sleep diary to get a better sense of your specific symptoms. Studies show that people’s perceptions of their insomnia symptoms do not always match up to the reality of their sleep loss, so a diary can help you gain clarity.</p><p>If your healthcare provider diagnoses you with insomnia, they will look for any underlying medical causes and aim to treat those conditions. They also may recommend one or more of the following treatments for insomnia: </p><ul><li>Good sleep hygiene habits, like keeping a consistent sleep schedule</li><li>Relaxation exercises, like meditation</li><li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</li><li>Sleep aid medications or herbal supplements</li><li>Light therapy</li><li>An exercise plan that works for you</li></ul><p><h3>Questions to Ask Your Provider</h3><p>If you have been experiencing any symptoms of insomnia, ask your healthcare provider:</p><ul><li>Could a medication I’m taking be causing my insomnia symptoms?</li><li>Could my daytime fatigue or mood changes be caused by insomnia?</li><li>Do I need a prescription sleep aid?</li><li>What habits can I develop to help me sleep better?</li></ul><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Insomnia is more than just occasional trouble sleeping. This sleep disorder involves consistent or repeated problems with falling or staying asleep that occur over time. While symptoms of acute insomnia generally resolve on their own, symptoms of chronic insomnia often persist and can lead to serious health problems.</p><p>You might have insomnia due to temporary life stressors or long-term medical or mental health conditions. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any problems sleeping so they can look for and address the factors that may be leading to your insomnia symptoms. Good sleep is vital to a healthy body, so it's important to get the treatment you need to improve your sleep.</p><p>    <strong>What is the main cause of insomnia symptoms?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Insomnia symptoms can have several causes. Symptoms of acute insomnia last a few days to a few weeks and may be caused by a stressful life event or schedule disruption. Symptoms of chronic insomnia last more than three months and may be caused by a medical condition, taking certain medications, or substance use.</p><p>    <strong>How many hours of sleep is considered insomnia?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Experts recommend that adults get at least seven hours of sleep per night. If you are consistently getting less than 6.5 hours of sleep, you might be experiencing insomnia.</p><p>    <strong>Is insomnia a form of anxiety?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Insomnia is highly associated with anxiety. In many cases, anxiety can lead to insomnia. In other cases, insomnia can lead to generalized anxiety. Insomnia also often causes people to feel anxious about whether they will be able to sleep and function well during the day in the future.</p>
