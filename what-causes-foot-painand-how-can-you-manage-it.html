Your feet are complex, and most people use them every day—two reasons why foot pain is common.</p><p>Pain can occur in any part of the foot due to injuries, overuse, or certain conditions. Depending on the cause, you can feel pain in the heel, arch, or ball of your foot. The top and sides of your feet can hurt as well, as can different parts of your toes.</p><p>Some cases of foot pain are acute, where the pain may come on suddenly and be short term. Other instances of foot pain are chronic, lasting for the long term.</p><p>Foot pain can slow you down and interfere with your life. To find foot pain relief and keep you moving, it’s important to address the cause of the pain.</p><h2>Potential Causes of Foot Pain</h2><p>There are many reasons you foot could be hurting. Here are 14 common causes of foot pain:</p><h3>1. Your Shoes</h3><p>Wearing shoes that don't properly fit your feet are a main reason for foot pain. The shoes' length or width might be wrong for you.</p><p>The type of shoes you wear could be causing you pain, too. For instance, shoes that don't have proper cushioning or that have high heels might cause foot pain.</p><h3>2. Plantar Fasciitis</h3><p>The plantar fascia is a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of your foot—from the front of your foot to your heel—to give your arch support. Plantar fasciitis is a condition you develop when this band of tissue becomes inflamed.</p><p>The inflammation can cause intense pain that's usually centered on the heel of the foot. The pain usually worsens after—not during—exercise. It's also common to feel the pain after a prolonged period of rest, such as when you get out of bed in the morning.</p><p>Oftentimes, the cause of plantar fasciitis is unclear. It's more common among people who are in their 40s and 50s, who run or stand on hard surfaces, or who have obesity.</p><h3>3. Corns and Calluses</h3><p>Corns and calluses are thickened areas of skin on your feet. They can develop in spots where you have repeated pressure or friction on the skin.</p><p>A corn is thick skin that develops on the top or side of a toe while a callus is thick skin that develops on the soles of your feet. The spots can be hard, flaky, and dry. Corns and calluses may or may not be painful.</p><h3>4. Ingrown Toenail</h3><p>An ingrown toenail happens when the sharp edge of a toenail grows into the skin on the side of the toe. Often caused by improper nail trimming, an ingrown toenail can lead to sharp pain, swelling, and sometimes pus. Improper nail trimming that can lead to ingrown toenails include cutting the nail too short or cutting the edge in a tapered way. </p><h3>5. Metatarsalgia</h3><p>Metatarsalgia is a pain in the ball of your foot. It can feel like you have a pebble in your shoe. The pain is usually shooting and sharp but can sometimes feel like a burning sensation. Metatarsalgia can be caused by exercise or by wearing shoes that are too tight on your foot. </p><h3>6. Achilles Tendonitis</h3><p>The Achilles tendon connects your heel bone to your calf muscle. The tendon can develop tendonitis, which is when it becomes inflamed from overuse or injury. You can get Achilles tendonitis if you exercise without stretching your legs properly.</p><p>Pain upon moving the affected area is usually the only symptom. You can usually feel the pain at the back of your heel or ankle.</p><h3>7. Bunion</h3><p>Bunions are bony bumps on the big toe. Over time, the first metatarsal—the long bone in your foot that connects to your big toe—begins to move outward, widening the foot and causing the big toe joint to bulge outward. The big toe itself is then directed toward the other toes.</p><p>Bunions grow slowly over time. They can be painful if you wear shoes that are tight against the bunion or walk or stand for a long time.</p><p>They run in families and are more common among women.</p><h3>8. Hammertoe</h3><p>Also called a claw toe, a hammertoe is when there’s an unusual bend in the middle of the toe. Hammertoes can be caused by shoes that don't fit properly, trauma to the foot, or inflammatory conditions like gout or rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>The bend in the toe itself can be painful. Pain can also be increased if the toe rubs against the shoe and leads to blisters or calluses. Wearing looser-fitting shoes can help.</p><h3>9. Sprained Toe</h3><p>When you stub your toe forcefully, you can tear or overstretch the ligament—the connective tissue that connects bones to each other.  Sprained toes can also happen when an exercise or activity hyperextends the toe, such as at the start of a run.</p><p>A sprained toe may throb with pain, swell, and bruise. Depending on the severity, it may take several weeks to heal.</p><h3>10. Bone Fracture</h3><p>Any of the bones in your foot may fracture, or break. Fractures most commonly happen because of trauma such as from an accident, osteoporosis, and overuse.</p><p>A broken bone in the foot can have similar symptoms to a sprain, including pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty moving the foot. A healthcare provider can run imaging tests to confirm a fracture.</p><h3>11. Arthritis</h3><p>Arthritis is the swelling of joints. It can happen anywhere in your body, including your feet.</p><p>There are many types of arthritis that can affect your foot, including post-traumatic arthritis, which occurs after an injury. Other types include osteoarthritis, when a joint experiences wear and tear, and rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks the joint tissues throughout the body.</p><p>Besides pain, you may feel stiffness in the toe joint and a reduced range of motion in the affected toe.</p><h3>12. Gout</h3><p>Gout is a type of arthritis. It usually affects the big toe, but can happen to any joint. Gout can cause extreme, sharp pains. The pain usually flares at night and often resolves itself within a few days. Your toe may look discolored and swollen and feel hot.</p><p>Gout is more common in males, people who have a family history of gout, and people who drink an excess amount of alcohol.</p><p>You can develop gout if your body has too much uric acid. Uric acid is a by-product created when your body breaks down purines, a chemical compound you take in through the food you eat. When there is too much uric acid, uric acid crystals can build up in joints and lead to gout.</p><h3>13. Plantar Warts</h3><p>Plantar warts are a type of skin lesion caused by the humanpapilloma virus (HPV). They develop on the soles of your feet. You can get them if you come in direct contact with HPV, such as by walking barefoot in a locker room.</p><p>Plantar warts usually don't cause symptoms. But for some people, the warts can be painful due to the pressure and friction put on them when you walk. They might look like black dots on your feet.</p><h3>14. Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p>Peripheral neuropathy is a condition you can develop when your peripheral nerves no longer work correctly. Your peripheral nerves send messages to and from the brain as well as to and from the spinal cord to the rest of your body. When one or more of these nerves don't work, you can develop pain in your feet.</p><p>A tingling or burning sensation in your feet and toes is actually often the the first sign of peripheral neuropathy. You may also have foot pain that can be described as deep.</p><p>Besides foot pain, peripheral neuropathy may cause pain and numbness in your legs and arms. You may also notice certain muscles are weaker or that you cannot digest food as easily.</p><p>Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Other potential causes include poor blood flow to your legs, autoimmune disorders, and low levels of vitamin B12.</p><h2>Risk Factors for Foot Pain</h2><p>While many people will experience foot pain at some point in their lives, there are a few factors which increase your risk, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Age: </strong>Older adults tend to have more foot pain than younger people.</li><li><strong>Sex:</strong> Women tend to have more foot pain than men, possibly due to shoe choices.</li><li><strong>Certain conditions:</strong> Some conditions put you at risk for developing foot problems. For instance, people with diabetes may experience nerve damage, which commonly causes foot pain. Depression, heart disease, and arthritis can be connected to foot pain as well.</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>If you have a job where you stand or walk a lot, you may be more likely to have foot pain.</li><li><strong>Smoking status: </strong>People who smoke are more likely to have bone fractures and slow-healing wounds.</li><li><strong>Footwear choices: </strong>What you wear on your feet could impact your foot health and lead to pain. For instance, shoes that have high heels, thin soles, or a hard insole without any built-in arch support may increase your risk for plantar fasciitis. And if you have bunions, wearing tight shoes can cause pain.</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> People with obesity are more prone to developing foot pain.</li></ul><h2>When To See a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>If you have chronic pain in your feet or have experienced an injury, you should see your regular healthcare provider or a foot doctor (podiatrist).</p><p>People with diabetes should have their feet checked regularly. Diabetes can cause reduced blood flow and nerve sensation to your feet, which means injuries can take longer to heal and small cuts or other issues may not be noticeable.</p><h2>How Is Foot Pain Diagnosed?</h2><p>The diagnosis of foot pain will depend on what your symptoms are. You can expect your healthcare provider to ask questions about your symptoms, family history, job, lifestyle, and any related injury. Some foot problems, like plantar warts, can be diagnosed with a visual exam by your healthcare provider. Others, like a fracture, may require an X-ray or other type of imaging.</p><h2>Treatments for Foot Pain</h2><p>The correct treatment will depend on the cause of your foot pain. Sometimes you can treat foot pain at home. Other times you might need a treatment plan from a healthcare provider. Common treatments for foot pain include the following:</p><h3>Lifestyle Changes</h3><p>There are some changes you can make yourself which may ease or resolve your foot pain. These include switching to better-fitting shoes, maintaining an optimal weight, and wearing proper footwear for the setting you are in. For instance, you should wear shoes in locker rooms and protective footwear when lifting heavy objects.</p><h3>Home Remedies</h3><p>Depending on your symptoms, you may find relief by taking simple measures at home. This can include soaking your feet in warm water, resting more than usual, or using cold packs or heating pads on the affected foot.</p><h3>Orthotics </h3><p>Shoe inserts—whether store-bought or custom-made—can be helpful in realigning the foot to correct problems like foot deformities. Many foot pain issues, like flat feet, plantar fasciitis, or hammertoe may be helped by using an orthotic shoe insert.</p><h3>Medication</h3><p>In some instances, such as with painful plantar fasciitis, your healthcare provider may recommend medication. These may include steroid shots, pain relievers, anti-inflammatory medication, and nerve medications.</p><p>Occasionally, surgery may be necessary. For example, if bunions become very painful, an orthopedic surgeon may suggest surgery to shave off the growth and realign the foot bones. Surgery is usually only recommended if other less-invasive techniques have failed to treat the pain.</p><h2>How To Prevent Foot Pain</h2><p>Not all foot pain may be preventable. If you break the bones in your foot during an accident, for instance, you might not have been able to do anything to prevent it. Some foot injuries can be prevented. Make sure to keep your floor clear of any clutter to avoid tripping hazards. You can also make sure to wear protective shoes when outside.</p><p>You can prevent bone fractures by strengthening your bones with weight-bearing exercises and a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium.</p><p>Foot pain unrelated to an injury might be preventable, as well. Try to wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes.</p><p>If you have arthritis or another condition that makes you likelier to develop foot pain, make sure to keep up with your management plan for that condition. For instance, regularly going to appointments for diabetes can help better manage the condition and prevent peripheral neuropathy and its pain.</p><h2>Living With Foot Pain</h2><p>Whether acute or chronic, foot pain can be difficult to live with.</p><p>Acute pain thankfully goes away after some time, and treatment may help with the healing process.</p><p>Chronic foot pain can last for the long term and has the potential to reduce your quality of life. Speaking with a healthcare professional, practicing self-care, and choosing proper footwear can help you improve your situation. Depending on the cause of your foot pain, icing your foot, wearing orthotic inserts, and stretching your foot can help reduce pain. In many cases, foot pain can be resolved.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Foot pain can affect the quality of your life. That's why figuring out what's causing the pain and addressing the cause is important. There are many reasons why your foot could be hurting, including a sprain, fracture, ingrown toenail, arthritis, bunion, and plantar fasciitis. Commonly, foot pain is caused by shoes that don't fit properly. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are experiencing pain in one or both feet. There are many available treatments that can help you find relief. There are also steps you can take to prevent pain from happening in the future.</p></main>
