The weight always crept back on because I couldn’t sustain any kind of diet change, but all that changed when I became more involved with my elderly mother’s care. Soon, I became acutely aware that her many health problems, poor mobility and all the medications she takes all stemmed from her being overweight. </p><p>Mum’s high blood pressure, high cholesterol, joint pain, heart issues and Type 2 diabetes are mostly problems that can disappear if you prioritise your health and diet – and were issues I was in danger of if I didn’t lose weight. Surprisingly, when I had my blood pressure taken at the doctor’s, she simply said it was a bit high and I needed to watch it, but nothing was said about my weight, which at the time was 16st 4lbs – at 5ft 4 I was a good few stones too heavy. But I’d already decided I wanted to age differently from my mum. </p><p>The thing is, my mobility was already suffering due to my weight. Climbing up and down stairs made my joints ache and lugging all my equipment around in my job as a wedding photographer had become increasingly hard. What’s more, it’s the kind of business where you’re out meeting people and need to look good, and my size made me very self-conscious. </p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1hV7c6_before_her_weight_loss_journey_airey_was_suffering_from_high_blood_pressure_and_reduced_mobility.jpg" alt="Before her weight loss journey, Airey was suffering from high blood pressure and reduced mobility"><figcaption><em>Before her weight loss journey, Airey was suffering from high blood pressure and reduced mobility. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rather than join a weight-loss club, I got myself a diet coach and a year on I’m three stone lighter and fitter than I’ve ever been. She didn’t tell me what I could and couldn’t eat, or get me counting calories, but focussed on my relationship with food. </p><p>She got me to explore my emotions around food. If I’d had a challenging day at work or an upset, I used to tell myself I “deserved” a glass of wine or two and a packet of crisps. Or I’d go out with girlfriends and have half a dozen gin and tonics when I could have just had two. </p><p>My eating and drinking habits were in response to how I felt, and, of course, I was looking for fulfilment. I unconsciously thought eating unhealthy foods was a solution to how I was feeling, when those foods were just hurting me in other ways. And she got me to understand that through history we’ve been feast or famine creatures and even though we’ve now got food in abundance we still carry those habits along with us, meaning we eat far more than we need to. </p><p>She got me to make a big thing of my goals for losing weight and to focus on my motivation to keep that alive. Working on my psychology was what really helped, because I no longer wanted to eat foods that weren’t good for me, nor overeat.</p><p>I no longer wanted to drink wine with my dinner or dive into the bread rolls while I waited for my main course when I ate out. Instead, I found I naturally made good food choices, always prioritising my goal of taking care of my future health and knowing that means more to me than anything else. Once I understood the underlying reasons for my eating habits, suddenly I felt so in control.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1hVeuB_airey_i_now_cook_healthy_meals_using_whole_foods.jpg" alt="Airey: 'I now cook healthy meals using whole foods'"><figcaption><em>Airey: 'I now cook healthy meals using whole foods' - Jeff Gilbert.

Instead of takeaways and convenience foods, I’ll now cook a healthy curry myself and knowing that I’ve put the effort in means I enjoy it so much more. Once I put that “tough day” energy into making a nice meal using healthy ingredients rather than reaching for wine and crisps, I discovered such pleasure in the process.</p><p>I also work out every morning for half an hour doing weight-bearing exercises, a bit of kickboxing and yoga, which means I’ve got so much more energy.</p><p>In the past, if I had a challenging day at work, I’d have a glass of wine and food treats because I ‘deserved’ them.  </p><p>Now I’m down to 13st 4lbs – a weight loss of 42lbs – my health has improved in so many ways. I sleep better and my husband tells me I don’t snore anymore. The joint pains in my knees and ankles have gone and I can move up and down the stairs more easily. My gums used to bleed every day, but that’s stopped since I have a healthier diet, and even the way I sit down has changed – when I was heavier, I couldn’t really cross my legs. Best of all, my blood pressure, which was once in the danger zone, is now normal.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">What I used to eat</h2><p>Breakfast was a large bowl of porridge with brown sugar and fruit. Lunch would be a takeaway baguette, crisps, fruit and sometimes chocolate. Dinner would be a ready meal or shop-bought pie, with potatoes or chips and veg, always with wine. Snacks would be crisps, chocolate and biscuits (every day!) and when eating out I’d always have wine and dessert.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1hV56X_in_aireys_new_diet_dinner_is_chicken_or_fish_with_lots_of_veg.jpg" alt="In Airey's new diet, 'dinner is chicken or fish with lots of veg'"><figcaption><em>In Airey's new diet, 'dinner is chicken or fish with lots of veg' - Jeff Gilbert.

I no longer snack and for meals out I just have a main course and swerve the rich sauces. If I fancy a treat, I have a handful of mixed nuts.</p><p><em>As told to Marina Gask</em></p><p><em>Recommended</em></p><p>Eat kimchi - and five easy ways to reduce belly fat (and they don’t include exercising)</p></main>
