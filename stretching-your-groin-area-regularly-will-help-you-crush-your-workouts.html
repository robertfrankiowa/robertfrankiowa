I'm not wrong, but there's a key muscle group I'm missing. You may not think about it until it gets tight or achey, but the groin is a superstar when it comes to powering performance. Stay with me. The groin propels your body in multiple directions, all while keeping your torso strong and stable. </p><p>That means when you’re running, walking, bending forward, doing a cardio workout—literally moving in <em>any</em> direction—your groin is working overtime. But, too much sitting can cause it to tighten up quick, according to Annie Mulgrew, CPT, founding instructor for CITYROW in New York City and NASM-certified personal trainer. </p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts: </strong>Annie Mulgrew, CPT, is the founding instructor for CITYROW in New York City and a NASM-certified personal trainer. Winnie Yu, DPT, CPT, is a sports and orthopedic physical therapist s at Bespoke Treatments in New York City.</p><p>The groin muscles play a critical role in movement and stability, so it’s super-important the area is both limber and strong, according to Mulgrew. These muscles can get into an overactive state if they’re compensating for weak gluteus medius muscles to stabilize the hip, according to Winnie Yu, DPT, CPT, a sports and orthopedic physical therapist s at Bespoke Treatments in New York City.</p><p>The groin is a pretty complex area, consisting of three fairly large muscle groups—the abdominals, iliopsoas, and adductors:</p><ul><li>Your <strong>adductors </strong>work together to adduct (or move toward the midline of the body) the thigh while keeping your lower extremities and pelvis stabilized. </li><li>The <strong>abdominal muscles</strong> help stabilize your spine. </li><li>The <strong>iliopsoas,</strong> on either side of your hips, help stabilize and flex your hips and stabilize your lower back.</li></ul><p>The muscles in the groin are often overlooked, which can lead to tightness, Yu adds. Make time for a few minutes of groin stretches to release that tension—and keep it away.</p><h2 class="body-h2">How To Stretch The Groin Area</h2><p>You can separate stretching into two different categories: dynamic and static. </p><ul><li>“<strong>Dynamic stretching</strong> is a great way to prepare for a workout,” Mulgrew says. (Try this five-minute dynamic stretching routine.) “If you’ve been immobile, or sitting, for an extended period of time, it’s best to stretch [the groin] in a dynamic way similar to a yoga flow, moving fluidly from stretch to stretch to increase the heat in the area and minimize stiffness.”</li><li><strong>Static stretching</strong>, on the other hand, focuses on holding stretches and positions for a period of time, says Mulgrew. "These are great to do post-exercise.” Roughly 60 seconds of static stretching was associated with a reduced risk of injury and an increased range of motion, a 2016 study found—aiding in overall athletic performance. </li><li><strong><em>Don't</em></strong><strong> stretch your groin if...</strong>you’re recovering from an injury, especially in that area. "Consult your doctor or physical therapist before doing any concentrated movements,” Mulgrew says.</li></ul><h2 class="body-h2">The 13 Best Groin Stretches</h2><p><em>Here, Mulgrew and Yu share their groin stretch recommendations to do after a workout.
