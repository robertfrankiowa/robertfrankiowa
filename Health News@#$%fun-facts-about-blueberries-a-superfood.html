Also, check out the “Using, Storing and Preserving Blueberries” fact sheet, available from Michigan Fresh.</p><p>There are many ways to incorporate blueberries into recipes, such as blueberry stuffed French toast. One of my favorite ways to enjoy blueberries, especially in the winter, is blueberry jam.</p><p>The following is an easy blueberry jam recipe you can make with kids, adapted from Real Simple Magazine.</p><h2>Easy Blueberry Jam</h2><p>Makes approximately 3 cups.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p> 5 cups blueberries (approximately 2.5 pints)</p><p> 1/2 cup sugar</p><p> Juice from 1 lemon</p><p> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p><p><strong>Directions</strong></p><p> In a medium saucepan, add the blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt. Stir to combine and gently smash the blueberries with the back of a large spoon until they begin to release their juices. Some berries will still be somewhat whole and that is fine.</p><p>Heat over medium high heat for approximately 18 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mixture will thicken and darken in color. Remove from heat and pour jam into glass jars. While still hot, place lids on jars to seal them.</p><p>Store jam in refrigerator for one month or place in freezer for up to one year.</p><h2>Blueberries for Sal</h2><p>After a tasty blueberry treat, I suggest reading “Blueberries for Sal.” This book is geared for 3-7 year-olds. Sal and her mother are picking blueberries to can for winter, but when Sal wanders to the other side of Blueberry Hill, she discovers a mama bear preparing for her own long winter.</p><p>Sal’s mother is followed by a small bear with a big appetite for berries. Will Sal and the small bear find their own mamas?</p><p><em>This article appeared originally on Michigan State University Extension.</em></p></main>
