Provided by Flow Space</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, actress, author, and TV host Maria Menounos faced a significant health challenge that tested her resilience and determination. As the host of the "Conversations with Maria Menounos" podcast, she underwent major surgery to remove the tail of her pancreas, spleen, 17 lymph nodes, and a massive uterine fibroid. Her journey was anything but easy, and unfortunately, it wasn't her first health scare.</p><p>In 2017, Menounos was diagnosed with a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumor and had to undergo surgery to remove it. At the same time, she was also caring for her mother, who had been diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in 2016, a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumor that’s the most common primary brain cancer in the U.S. In a recent conversation with Flow Space, Menounos opened up about her diagnosis, her recovery, and the joy of motherhood afterward (she became a mother to a daughter last year).</p><p>"It was definitely a lot. I think the biggest thing for me was, am I going to be okay for my baby," Menounos told Flow Space. "And, you know, I at some point was like, okay, like everything, I have to just [focus on] baby stuff. I gotta get through all the testing, I gotta get through the surgery, I gotta get through recovery. But once I got that clean CAT scan, and I knew I was safe, then I was just so relieved."</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Her renewed perspective on health</strong></h2><p>Reflecting on her experience, Menounos immediately thinks of her daughter, Athena, who was born on June 23, 2023 via surrogate, only one year after her second surgery. It wasn’t until Athena’s recent birthday that the magnitude of Menounos' ordeal fully hit her.</p><p>"It just started hitting me about two weeks ago, when Athena was turning one, that I went through this massive surgery," Menounos says. "And just a year ago, this was all happening. Someone looked me in the eyes and told me that I had this large mass on my pancreas and that was very scary. It's wild, because I also had a baby on the way. Life has to keep moving forward."</p><p>The arrival of Menounos’ daughter has brought her immense joy and belonging. She adds that Athena's presence has also provided her with a renewed perspective on her health, pushing her to prioritize her health even more. “I want to be there for every milestone with her, her wedding, her babies, everything," Menounos says. "She’s lit up our lives in so many ways. So I think that’s medicine. Every day is Christmas morning for us waiting for her to wake up. Everyday we get to laugh, snuggle, and hold her, and I look at it so differently. Because now I make choices based on if someone was going to look me in the eye and give me another diagnosis."</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How she’s adapted to life post-surgery</h2><p>Post-surgery, Menounos says she's embraced various lifestyle changes. Regular screenings are now a priority, and she has incorporated numerous health practices into her daily routine.  “I’m trampolining and rebounding every day," Menounos says. "I’m red lighting, and I’m getting my sunrise sun. I’m doing everything that I can and bringing Athena along with me. I incorporate her into my sunrise fascial release program and my stretches and everything. I’m making her the CEO of her health while I’m doing that as well." </p><p>On June 8th, Menounos celebrated her 46th birthday. When asked how growing a year older hits differently, she says her outlook on aging has transformed, with her focusing on the gift of time rather than the number itself.  "I get to be 46. That was maybe not going to happen," Menounos says. </p><p>Looking ahead, Menounos says she envisions a future of full mind, body, and soul healing. She’s committed to a daily meditation practice as well as exploring and sharing holistic health practices. “I’m experimenting with a lot of things, and I’m seeing incredible results," she adds. </p><p>Menounos' advocacy extends beyond her personal journey, aiming to inspire and assist others facing similar challenges. More than that, her story is a testament to the resilience and the transformative power of motherhood. Through adversity, Menounos says she's found purpose, joy, and a deeper connection to life, proving that even in the face of life’s hardest hits, it’s possible to rise and keep moving forward.</p><p>"I'm holding space for the fact that nothing has to be perfect," she says. "So the perfectionist in me thinks I need to see everything perfect. But I know that I have a lot of valuable information and experience to share with people regardless." </p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
