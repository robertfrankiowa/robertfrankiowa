However, even in jeans, King emphasized how difficult it was to keep up with her colleague. The moves were so difficult to execute that the actress even joked about their names.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"> <p><em>But she taught me like the most epic, awful, butt workout I’ve ever learned in my life. It was like so intense. (…) I thought I could hang, but I couldn’t hang. </em></p>    <p><em>It was like all these “donkey kicks”, and the “rainbows”, and the, you know, “fire hydrants” (…) but you have to keep your leg in the air for like 12 years.</em></p> </blockquote><p>Nicole Kidman is already known for her dedication to fitness and health. The actress not only maintains a rigorous exercise routine, but also shares moments of her runs, hikes, and also riding sessions on her social media. She even impresses by not getting carried away by the weather or the season, always maintaining a discipline.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Nicole Kidman Stays In Shape</h2><figure><img title="Provided by FandomWire" src="IMG/BB1pGbXQ_nicole_kidman_in_aquaman_warner_bros.jpg" alt="Nicole Kidman in Aquaman (Warner Bros.)"><figcaption><em>Nicole Kidman in Aquaman (Warner Bros.).

Today, at the age of 57, she is still on that path.</p><p>According to the actress, the secret to achieving physical shape is constancy, but also the importance of diversifying activities and exercises. Over time, she has tried and still tries to invest in spinning, yoga and running. During the filming of <em>Aquaman</em>, for example, she didn’t find it so difficult to learn fight choreography, due to her impressive stamina (via Daily Mail).</p><p>However, eating well is a fundamental part of the whole strategy. Kidman is not so restricted and allows herself to have freer moments in her diet by adopting the 80/20 rule, which consists of consuming 80% healthy food and 20% less nutritious food. She believes in a balanced approach, although in moderation, opting for fresh and natural foods.</p><figure><img title="Provided by FandomWire" src="IMG/BB1pGnIH_no_doubt_nicole_kidman_had_a_crush_on_him_old_footage_of_jimmy_fallon_in_prime_explains_why_the_oscar_win.jpg" alt="“No doubt Nicole Kidman had a crush on him”: Old Footage of Jimmy Fallon in Prime Explains Why the Oscar Winner Was Crushing Over Him Even After Romance With Tom Cruise"><figcaption><em>“No doubt Nicole Kidman had a crush on him”: Old Footage of Jimmy Fallon in Prime Explains Why the Oscar Winner Was Crushing Over Him Even After Romance With Tom Cruise.
