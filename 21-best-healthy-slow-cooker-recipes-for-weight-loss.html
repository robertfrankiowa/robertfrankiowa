    <main><h1>21 Best Healthy Slow Cooker Recipes for Weight Loss</h1><p>Sadly, losing weight for some can feel like a full-time job. That's in addition to working at an actual job. What's a dieter to do? Well, for one thing, we strongly recommend having some of the best healthy slow cooker recipes for weight loss at your fingertips. It may be just the help you need to get through a busy week.</p><p><em>Eat This, Not That!</em> spoke with <strong>Laura Burak MS, RD</strong>, the founder of GetNaked® Nutrition and author of <em>Slim Down with Smoothies</em>, who reveals one of the biggest struggles among her clients who are trying to lose weight and boost their health is finding the time to prepare healthy meals. "Enter a slow cooker," she says. "You simply throw a bunch of quality ingredients like lean proteins, veggies, and sauce in the slow cooker in the morning before you leave the house, and you set it so that when you get home, dinner is served. Your energy and decision-making tank is the most full at the beginning of the day and close to or nearly empty by the end, so using a slow cooker to set yourself up for healthier meals—especially at dinner when you struggle the most—can be super beneficial to move closer to your health goals. You can also think about buying a bigger size so there is enough for leftovers."</p><p>Having a slow cooker in your kitchen is really like having an assistant to help you out. All you need to do is decide on your meal for the day, get your ingredients organized, and set the timer. Voila—your meal will be ready to eat when you'd like it to be.</p><p>When choosing just the right slow cooker recipes for weight loss, consider the following tips, according to Burak:</p><p><ul><p>  <li>A balanced meal that keeps you full and satisfied should include the three macronutrients: protein, carbs, and fat. "Think lean protein like poultry, pork, or tofu for protein and fat, and beans, lentils, corn, potatoes, and any veggies for carbs/fiber," Burak explains. This combination of high-quality ingredients offers a lot of volume and not a lot of calories, which is a recipe for weight loss success.</li><p>  <li>Choose "slow" carbs in your meals the majority of the time, which are "naturally higher fiber carb options" that take more time to digest and help stabilize your blood sugar. Pairing these types of carbs, such as lentils, beans, corn, and potatoes, with sufficient lean protein like fish, poultry, eggs, tofu, and meat, along with as many veggies as possible, makes for the ultimate nutrient-dense meal.</li></ul><p>To make the recipe selection process even easier, we're here with some of the best healthy slow cooker recipes for weight loss to add to your weekly rotation.
