    <main><h1>How I Learned to Love My Body After Gaining Weight</h1><p>Have you ever looked in the mirror without recognizing the person staring back at you? That was me after gaining weight, standing in a department store fitting room with jeans that wouldn’t zip up. At over 200 pounds, I could sense people mocking me behind my back about my weight. </p><figure><img title="How I Learned to Love My Body After Gaining Weight" src="IMG/BB1nOh4t_how_i_learned_to_love_my_body_after_gaining_weight.jpg" alt="How I Learned to Love My Body After Gaining Weight"><figcaption><em>How I Learned to Love My Body After Gaining Weight.

My body changed after marriage and the baby, but inside, I was the same fun-loving and jolly person. I decided not to brood anymore about how I look. Instead, I focused more on accepting myself and finding happiness in who I am.</p><p>It marked the start of a profound journey—a quest to accept the extra pounds and celebrate them. This is how I learned to silence the inner critic and embrace every curve and contour of my changing body with love and respect.</p><h2>It Started with Negative Self-Talk</h2><p>The journey began in a department store fitting room, where I struggled with jeans that no longer fit. I had been wearing the same size for years, and now this looked like it was meant for someone ten years younger than me. As I faced my reflection, my inner critic unleashed a barrage of negativity. </p><figure><img title="It Started with Negative Self-Talk" src="IMG/BB1nOeVZ_it_started_with_negative_self_talk.jpg" alt="It Started with Negative Self-Talk"><figcaption><em>It Started with Negative Self-Talk.

That’s when I first recognized the negativity of my self-talk. I knew I had to do something, or this guilt would deplete my confidence for life. Awareness of negative self-talk was the first step.</p><h2>From Criticism to Kindness</h2><p>From then on, I started countering every negative thought with a positive affirmation, slowly changing the narrative from criticism to kindness. I started focusing more on what I could do – focus more on my abilities. I knew I had to be kind to myself if I had to come out of this situation happily.</p><h2>Choosing Fitness</h2><p>I had healthy arms and legs, so I signed up for Yoga. In these sessions, I learned the value of strength and flexibility over aesthetics. Each pose I mastered taught me to appreciate what my body could do. I started loving my body again, which instilled a sense of pride.</p><p>The yoga practice improved my physical strength, brought mental clarity, and increased my emotional resilience, reminding me daily of my body’s capabilities and resilience.</p><h2>Adding More Activities in My Life</h2><p>Honestly, I didn’t lose much weight even after Yoga sessions. I still weighed over 190 pounds. But I did start feeling good about my body at this time. I decided not to focus on weight anymore and started fitting hobbies that could fit into my routine. </p><figure><img title="Adding More Activities in My Life" src="IMG/BB1nOjyg_adding_more_activities_in_my_life.jpg" alt="Adding More Activities in My Life"><figcaption><em>Adding More Activities in My Life.

It allowed me to enjoy the freedom and rhythm of movement, making me feel alive and grateful for my body’s capabilities. Whether it was a structured class or a spontaneous dance in my living room, moving to music became a celebration of my body’s movement, not its size. This physical expression of joy helped to break down the walls of self-critique further and opened a space for self-celebration.</p><h2>The Food I Loved</h2><p>The initial couple of months focused on exercising, signing up for hobbies that might have helped shed some weight, and eating the right food. To tell you the truth, I got tired of it. Why? I started loving my body in its current state. I no longer longed for a slim figure. This was another decisive moment in my life. I was not ready to give up on my favorite pasta and ice cream sundaes.</p><h2>Choosing Happiness Over Weight</h2><p>What’s so bad about eating what I love if it’s not harming my body? Of course, I did not plan on eating like an ogre. It was just about eating what I love but in slight moderation. This helped me balance my favorite grub and my love for my body.</p><h2>Enjoying Making Fun of Myself</h2><p>Guess what – I was still fat, and people still stared when I went to the stores. But this did not bother me anymore as I accepted who I was. When with family or friends, I wouldn’t wait for anyone to pass comments about my weight. Rather, I became the first one whenever the situation arose. </p><p>I was surprised that people loved me more when I was cool, making fun of my round body. I guess it wasn’t as big a deal as I used to think. So what if you are fat?</p><h2>Investing in Mental Well-being</h2><p>I delved into books and podcasts about self-love and body positivity, absorbing stories and advice that resonated with my experiences. Embracing meditation helped clear my mind and focus on gratitude, reinforcing a state of calm and acceptance within myself.</p><figure><img title="Investing in Mental Well-being" src="IMG/BB1nOagv_investing_in_mental_well_being.jpg" alt="Investing in Mental Well-being"><figcaption><em>Investing in Mental Well-being.

Self-care and self-love taught me to appreciate the present moment and recognize my continuous progress toward a more self-compassionate life.</p><p>To anyone facing challenges with body image, a number on a scale does not define you. Your body deserves care and respect. Embrace your journey to self-love—it may be fraught with challenges, but it is incredibly rewarding.</p></main>
