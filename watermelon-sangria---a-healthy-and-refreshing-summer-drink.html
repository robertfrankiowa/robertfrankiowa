You only need white or ros√© wine, watermelon, a good hard lime seltzer, and a handful of chopped berries. Mix everything and you have the perfect <strong>refreshing summer drink</strong>! And you don‚Äôt even need any fancy utensils or shakers to make it. You can even mix everything inside the watermelon ‚Äúshell‚Äù if you want. Less cleaning, more enjoying with this<strong> easy watermelon sangria recipe</strong>! </p><p>Perfect for a summer dinner or a beach party, this refreshing summer drink will give <strong>a European touch</strong> to your gathering! Did you know that the original red sangria (made with red wine, and different types of fruits) was born in Spain? And that it is a very popular drink all over the Mediterranean countries? </p><p>Moreover, it goes very well with my Healthy Vegan Bruschetta, a great summer dinner recipe, and with these 3 Easy and Healthy Summer Salads for Outdoor Picnics. </p><p>Ultimately, if you want a <strong>kid-friendly, non-alcoholic version </strong>of this Watermelon Sangria, substitute the white wine and hard seltzer with some lemon soda and grape juice. Alternatively, you can use apple or pineapple juice for a sweeter pitcher, or even watermelon juice to keep with the theme.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: pure√© the watermelon with a blender or mixer, and aim at removing all the bigger chunks! This ensures a better texture and a more round taste to the drink!</p><p>Want to know more about the incredible health properties of watermelon?

On the contrary, if you are sober, or don‚Äôt like the taste of alcohol, it is totally fine ‚Äì and certainly better for your liver! This article aims just at showing how it is possible to <strong>be healthy whilst not restricting</strong> some ‚Äúless healthy‚Äù foods and drinks.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Adopt an 80/20 approach</h3><p>My first tip is to adopt an <strong>‚Äú80/20 approach‚Äù toward nutrition</strong>. This means eating nourishing foods 80% of the time, whilst leaving 20% for less nutritious foods. Alcohol is often defined as ‚Äúempty calories‚Äù since the nutritional profile of alcohol is quite poor. However, <strong>learning moderation with alcohol</strong>, and therefore being able to fit it into ‚Äúthe 20%‚Äù, is the right way to go. Everything in moderation is always the best policy!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Set a drinking goal for the week</h3><p>If you want to hold yourself accountable for this, <strong>set a drinking goal for the week</strong>. Choose a set amount of drinks you want to aim for the week and stick to it. Every time you‚Äôre tempted to pour yourself an additional glass, remind yourself how it will impact your long-term overall health. <strong>Drink smarter, not harder.</strong></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Pace your drinking with water</h3><p>Another suggestion is to make sure that your first drink of the night is a glass of water and to <strong>pace your drinking with plain H2O or sparkling water</strong>. For every alcoholic beverage, you should have one to two drinks of water. In this way, you will not only limit the amount of alcohol you are going to consume, but you will also prevent annoying hangovers. Read this for more tips on how to deal with hangovers).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Opt for healthier, low-carb cocktails</h3><p>Last but not least, aim for<strong> ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù, low-carb cocktails</strong>. As a general rule, try to limit the drink combinations higher in sugar (for example Pina Colada, or Margarita). Aim instead for relatively healthier alcoholic drinks. These include, for example, pure liquors such as vodka, whiskey, triple sec, scotch, gin, and tequila, as they all have zero carbs and therefore lower calories. It goes without saying that, in moderation, every type of drink is allowed‚Ä¶ remember, balance is always the key!</p><h5 class="wp-block-heading">Do you have any other good tips for enjoying a good drink while still eating a healthy diet? </h5><p>Here are all my tips for incorporating alcohol into a healthy lifestyle!
