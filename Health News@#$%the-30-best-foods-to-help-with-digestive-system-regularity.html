    <main><h1>The 30 Best Foods to Help With Digestive System Regularity</h1><h2>Yogurt</h2><p>Probiotics are vital for a healthy digestive tract to help keep things regular and reduce constipation. Yogurt is full of probiotics and can soften stool and help increase frequency.</p><h2>Kiwi</h2><p>Kiwi is a high-fiber fruit that can help move things along. Eat two a day to prevent constipation and stay regular.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Oranges</h2><p>This delicious citrus fruit is excellent for digestion. The fiber in oranges helps the growth of good colon flora. Oranges make for a great snack and are a tasty alternative to some of the other foods that help move your bowels (like prunes). </p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Coffee</h2><p>Your morning coffee does more than just wake you up. It can also stimulate receptors in your stomach. A cup of coffee at breakfast triggers the gastrocolic reflex which causes bowel contractions and makes you go.</p><h2>Peppermint</h2><p>Peppermint is great for an upset stomach. Its soothing effect can relax the muscles in your intestinal tract and help you go. If you have IBS or are constipated, try some peppermint to help calm your stomach and loosen things up.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Whole Grain Cereal</h2><p>Starting your day with a bowl of whole grain cereal can keep you regular all day because it's full of fiber. Whole grains are beneficial for constipation relief because their cell walls are hard to digest and hold onto water.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Broccoli</h2><p>Broccoli is a vegetable you may have despised as a kid, but this healthy food has a lot of benefits. It’s full of fiber -- in fact, one cup of raw broccoli has about 28 grams of fiber. That’s 10% of the daily requirement of fiber for women.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Mangos</h2><p>Eating a mango a day benefits digestion. Mangos keep the good bacteria in your gut alive and can help control your blood sugar. Mangos have further been linked to reducing body fat, so eat up!</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><figure><img title="Mangos" src="IMG/BB1psGwB_mangos.jpg" alt="Mangos"><figcaption><em>Mangos.

They contain both the soluble and insoluble types. You can find flax seeds in bread or add them to what you eat.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Water</h2><p>You should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Water keeps you hydrated and helps keep you regular. If you’re not drinking enough water, you can quickly become constipated. Try increasing your water consumption if you find yourself having trouble moving your bowels.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Carrots</h2><p>Carrots are known for being full of beta-carotene and an excellent source of fiber. The soluble fiber found in carrots carries low-quality cholesterol out of your body. Whether you eat them raw or cooked, carrots will help keep you regular.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Prunes</h2><p>You may turn your nose up at prunes, but they’re a great source of fiber which means they can help keep you regular. For every 100 grams of prunes, there are six grams of fiber. If you’re not a fan of eating the dried fruit, try prune juice which is a natural laxative.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Plums</h2><p>If you absolutely can’t stomach prunes, go for plums. They still get the job done and will help keep you regular. They’re a rich source of naturally occurring sorbitol.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Figs</h2><p>Figs are high in natural fiber. You can get 7.4 grams of fiber from eating four figs, but they're high in sugar, so keep an eye on your waistline. The good news is the high fiber content offsets the sugar.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Pineapple</h2><p>If you’re feeling constipated, reach for a glass of pineapple juice. One cup of unsweetened pineapple juice has half a gram of fiber. The fiber in the juice can help unblock a stopped up digestive system and get things going again as the natural plant enzymes improve your bowel function.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><figure><img title="Pineapple" src="IMG/BB1psGxc_pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple"><figcaption><em>Pineapple.

There are many types of beans to choose from, and all provide a significant amount of both insoluble and soluble fiber.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Green Tea</h2><p>Drinking green tea can lower your risk of some types of cancer, increase your metabolism, and help you lose weight. The nutritional beverage is also great for keeping you regular. Consuming green tea can loosen stool by acting as a natural laxative thanks to the caffeine in the tea.</p><h2>Bananas</h2><p>Bananas are another fruit high in fiber and contain probiotics that are vital for gut health. The insoluble fiber in bananas helps your bowel movements by making it easier to stay regular.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Avocados</h2><p>Whether you like it on toast or as guacamole, you can’t go wrong with avocados. The high magnesium in avocados draws moisture into your digestive tract. This helps improve flow and softens stool, making it easier to pass.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Brown Rice</h2><p>Brown rice is rich in nutrients. There are a number of benefits to eating brown rice, including digestion. One cup of brown rice has about four grams of fiber which can help regulate bowel movements and keep you feeling full.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><figure><img title="Brown Rice" src="IMG/BB1psUjv_brown_rice.jpg" alt="Brown Rice"><figcaption><em>Brown Rice.

This makes it easier to pass through your digestive system. Spinach is also low in fermentable carbohydrates, which are responsible for triggering IBS symptoms.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Raisins</h2><p>Snacking on raisins is an excellent way to fight constipation and avoid taking over the counter laxatives. Dried fruit is a great source of dietary fiber. It also contains sorbitol, a natural laxative.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Apples</h2><p>"An apple a day keeps the doctor away" is probably something you heard as a kid. Apples are an essential part of a healthy diet. One apple can contain about 4.4 grams of fiber, and like other fruits, it additionally has sorbitol which can help increase bowel movements.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Oats</h2><p>Start your day with a bowl of oatmeal and get your digestive tract moving. One cup of oat provides you with 16 grams of fiber, but don’t go for the instant oatmeal since it’s packed with sugar.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Artichokes</h2><p>Increase your fiber consumption by adding fresh artichokes to your diet. They're also high in antioxidants which may aid in preventing cancer, but that’s not all. Artichokes can further help regulate blood pressure because of their magnesium and potassium amounts.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Peaches</h2><p>Peaches are packed with fiber to aid in digestion. A small peach contains about two grams of fiber, a medium peach about 2.5 grams of fiber, and larger peaches can provide up to 3.5 grams of fiber. As a bonus, they’re delicious.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Blackberries</h2><p>You can get 8 grams of fiber per one cup of blackberries. That’s twice the amount of other berries, like strawberries and blueberries. Blackberries are additionally full of antioxidants.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Sweet Potato</h2><p>To get things moving along, eat a baked sweet potato with skin because it will give you 3.8 grams of fiber. The high fiber in sweet potatoes helps prevent and relieve constipation, but you’ll want to leave the skin on as it has most of the fiber. </p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><h2>Bone Broth</h2><p>When you make bone broth, you slow cook it for 24-72 hours. All the minerals and amino acids from the bones mix into the broth, making it super nutritious. The nutrients in the broth can help heal and seal your gut lining in your intestines. That means it can help relieve IBS symptoms and keep your digestion regular.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p><figure><img title="Bone Broth" src="IMG/BB1psUjN_bone_broth.jpg" alt="Bone Broth"><figcaption><em>Bone Broth.

They also have naturally-occurring, sorbitol to act as a laxative and loosens up your stools.</p><p>(Image via Pinterest)</p></main>
