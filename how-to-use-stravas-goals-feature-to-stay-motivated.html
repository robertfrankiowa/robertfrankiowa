With the Strava goals feature, you can easily set and keep track of your efforts. All you have to do is choose your sport and decide on a milestone.</p><h2>       Are Goals Available on Strava’s Free Plan?     </h2><p>Unfortunately, you can’t access Strava’s goals feature on its free plan. However, at the time of writing, Strava offers a 30-day free trial. This way, you can test the best Strava features before deciding if you should subscribe to its paid plan.</p><h2>       How to Set a New Goal for Your Activities     </h2><p>If you often run low on motivation to complete your workouts or you need a better way to keep track of your efforts, you can set a new goal for your Strava activities. Or maybe you’re training for an event and want to make sure you’ll be ready. Either way, Strava can help you monitor your training.</p><p>On the Strava mobile app, you can find the <strong>Goals</strong> feature within the <strong>Progress</strong> tab. As long as you have an active Strava Premium subscription, the feature should be available. If it's missing, try updating the app.</p><p>To add a new goal, tap on the <strong>Plus (+)</strong> icon. Now, you have to personalize your goal. You can choose one of the activities you’ve done before or try something new.</p><p>Alternatively, Strava allows you to combine your efforts. For example, any “off-road sport” such as hiking, trail running, or gravel riding will count towards your goal.</p><p>You can then set your goal frequency and type. You can choose to complete your goal by distance, time, or elevation. Once you’re done customizing it, tap <strong>Save Goal</strong>.</p><p>If you don't want to go the same route every time while completing your goal, you can check out Strava's global map feature.</p><h2>       How to Create a Segment Goal     </h2><p>As you may know, you might encounter a Strava segment on your run or ride. Every time you complete one of these segments, Strava records your time and compares it to your previous efforts and your friends’ or other athletes' efforts.</p><p>Now, if you want to become the board leader, you can set up a segment goal. At the time of writing, this feature is available only on Strava for web. Here’s how you can set a segment goal:</p><ol>           <li>             Log into your Strava account.       </li>           <li>             Head to <strong>Dashboard > My goals</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                          </li>           <li>             Click the <strong>Set a goal</strong> button.       </li>           <li>             Select <strong>Explore Segments and Set a Goal</strong>. By default, Strava will set your current location, but you can set a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                          </li>           <li>             Select your type of activity.       </li>           <li>             Select the desired segment from the left pane.       </li>           <li>             You can click on <strong>View details</strong> if you need more information.       </li>           <li>             Once you’ve found a segment that you want to complete, select <strong>Set goal</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                          </li>           <li>             Type in your goal time and select a date to complete the goal by.       </li>           <li>             Click <strong>Create segment goal</strong>.       </li>       </ol><p>Once you complete your goal, Strava will display it within your feed.</p><h2>       Who Can See Your Goals?     </h2><p>According to Strava, who can see your goals within your profile depends on the goal type. Segment and power goals can be seen by anyone visiting your profile. However, only your followers can see your weekly, monthly, or annual goals.</p><h2>       Set and Achieve Your Goals on Strava     </h2><p>Setting goals on Strava is an easy way to keep track of your progress even if you use the app for multiple activities. If you want to take your training and fitness to the next level, you might also want to try an AI fitness app. These apps can create a customized workout plan and program, depending on what you want to achieve.</p></main>
