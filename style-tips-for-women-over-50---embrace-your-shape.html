    <main><h1>Style Tips for Women Over 50 - Embrace Your Shape!</h1><p>Ladies, let’s celebrate style, confidence, and the beautiful bodies we’ve earned through our journey to our 50’s and beyond! I made this Style Tips for Women Over 50 post to share with you how I’ve learned to embrace my shape as I grow older. I’ve learned that our age doesn’t mean we can’t have fun with fashion and feel fabulous in our clothes.</p><p>Our bodies naturally change as we age – maybe we’ve gained a few curves, lost some in other areas, or noticed a shift in our weight distribution. These changes are a normal part of life and nothing to be ashamed of. I know my weight distribution has changed and it can be frustrating at times, but we have to learn to “work around it” and celebrate the life we are living now. Here is a helpful article I read from the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>In this post, we’ll explore some common body shapes and offer styling tips for each. I paid special attention to the apple shape (which I identify with) and discussed some common body changes that come with menopause. Whether you’re dressing for a special occasion or want to feel great in your everyday wear, I’ve got you covered. </p><p><strong>Remember: </strong>Style has no age limit, and every body is beautiful!</p><p><em>We have affiliate relationships, meaning we may get a small referral commission at no additional cost if you shop using our links.</em></p><h2><strong>Styling Tips for Women Over 50 – Embrace Your Shape</strong></h2><h3><strong>Hourglass</strong></h3><p><strong>click the links below to shop now!</strong></p><p>Dahlia Tie Front Mini Shirtdress | Flare Jeans | Cap-Sleeve Maxi Dress </p><p><strong>Description:</strong> Curvy with nearly equal hip and bust measurements; well-defined waist legs and upper body are proportionate.</p><p><strong>Style tips</strong></p><ul> <li>Embrace your curves with wrap dresses and belted styles to show off your waist.
