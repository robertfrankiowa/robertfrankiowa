    <main><h1>Top 12 Yoga Retreats for Mature Women</h1><p>Yoga has gained immense popularity among women in their prime as it provides a harmonious balance between physical and mental wellness. Yoga retreats are an ideal escape for anyone seeking relaxation and rejuvenation.</p><p>“A yoga retreat is a relationship with the Self,” according to Jenna Pfingston, Embodiment Coach, E-RYT 500 Yoga Teacher, Primal Medicine Guide, and owner of jalaBlu Collective Healing & jala Blue School of Yoga in Buena Vista, Colorado. She has held retreats since 2012 and also hosts yoga retreats in Uvita, Costa Rica (see details below).</p><p>Pfingston says, “A yoga retreat can be a powerful portal into self-transformation, compassion, inspiration, and great awakenings. I believe that souls searching for a yoga retreat are seeking a deeper connection to their personal journey.”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Choose the Perfect Yoga Retreat for You?</h2><p>With so many yoga retreats and so little time, how do you choose the perfect one for you? Whether you’re a beginner or advanced lover of yoga, taking the time to search for that ideal yoga retreat is a high priority.</p><p>For the past five years, Certified Yoga Therapist Amber Newberry has facilitated an annual yoga retreat, Shalom, at La Foret in Colorado Springs (see details below).</p><p>Newberry suggests asking yourself these questions when looking for your perfect yoga retreat:</p><ul> <li>Are you only able to spend a night or two away? Then, look for a local yoga retreat.</li>    <li>Do you want to be outside in nature or mostly inside?</li>    <li>Are you looking for an adventure? Then maybe a retreat out of the country would be amazing for you.</li>    <li>Are you an advanced yogi? Then, find an instructor who tells you you will be challenged at their retreat.</li>    <li>Are you a brand-new beginner? Then retreats focused more on body connecting and resetting might be better for you.</li>    <li>Look at the cost. If your budget is limited, a rustic retreat might be right for you. If money is no object, find a retreat with a private room and gourmet cuisine if that is something you like.</li>    <li>Review pictures from past retreats to get an idea of what a certain yoga retreat might look like. What is the general age and fitness of the attendees? Does that match what you are looking for?</li>    <li>Some yoga retreats include a spiritual component. If you want that, look for more information on the retreat page.</li>    <li>Finding a yoga instructor online whom you connect with spiritually is another way to find retreats that suit you.</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What style of yoga do they offer?</h2><p>The founder and CEO of Yogi Flight School and co-founder and CEO of SoulTribe Adventures, Nathania Stambouli, MA, E-RYT 500, has led 26 international retreats with her life and retreat partner, Gary Leake. She offers the following additional tips to find your perfect yoga retreat.</p><p>All yoga is not created equal! Retreats typically include one (or more) style of yoga, but it’s important to know what they offer before you sign up. Not all yoga is appropriate for everybody. If you are working with injuries or health conditions, gentle yoga may be more appropriate than power vinyasa.</p><p>Make a note of the style(s) of yoga offered by the retreat to ensure it’s a style you want to learn or practice! If unfamiliar with their style, drop them a line to ask for more info or check out videos of the style on YouTube.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How deep do you want to go?</h2><p>“A retreat is an amazing opportunity to get away from the grind and do deeper work on yourself,” according to Stambouli. “You may also find answers to questions that may be heavy on your heart, get inspired to change directions in your personal life or career – and a whole lot more.”</p><p>Retreats are typically set up with a theme or goal in mind. Make sure the retreat’s vision matches yours! Looking at the retreat’s itinerary is one of the best ways to ensure the trip is your jam.</p><p>Looking for a deeply transformational experience that will send you home feeling empowered, fully expressed, and free? A quiet retreat with only one yoga class per day and lots of downtime may not be the best way to reach that goal. It may be more impactful to join a retreat with built-in personal development workshops or other opportunities to dig deep.</p><p>On the other hand, if you just want to chill and relax, don’t choose a retreat that involves hiking to the top of a mountain in the middle of the night.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">1.
