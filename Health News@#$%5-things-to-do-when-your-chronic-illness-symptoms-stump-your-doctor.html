Provided by Flow Space</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last summer, I woke up in the middle of the night with heavy chest pains similar to what I had experienced in the past with acute anxiety. Usually, box breathing and gentle yoga would alleviate most or all of the pressure. Neither worked, and it felt different. I was gasping for air for hours in pain and intense fear. I was also having trouble swallowing - first foods, then water. Weeks later, I woke up choking on my saliva. I went to urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a condition where the upper chamber of the heart is not in sync with the lower heart chambers. </p><p>The cardiologist I followed up with dismissed this diagnosis and told me that my heart was perfectly healthy. "You're in great shape, you work out, have low cholesterol, and have an athlete’s heart rate," he told me. I'd need to see a GI for my trouble swallowing. A month later, I ended up in the ER. Lyme disease? Pericarditis? A side effect of Covid or my last booster shot? None of the doctors who saw me, including a cardiologist, could agree on a diagnosis. After each doctor's visit, I returned home feeling confused and helpless. </p><p>In between sleepless nights and third and fourth opinions from specialists, including my OB/GYN, who suspected bradycardia, characterized by a low heart rate, I googled my symptoms and researched each diagnosis I had received. However, instead of falling into a big black box of unknowns, I did something productive with the information. I leveraged my notes with technology, hiveminds, and accessible medical professionals. I wasn't seeking a definitive diagnosis from these sources, but instead gathering more information and searching for support and relief. </p><p>Today, my health condition has mysteriously subsided the same way it began. I still don't know the underlying cause, but my body appears to have responded to me listening to its clues and creating a support network to help me make more informed decisions. We should turn over every stone to care for our health, but we don't have to be at the mercy of long wait times or rely solely on the internet to get the support we deserve.</p><p>Whether you have symptoms that have stumped your doctors or are waiting six months to see a specialist, here are five ways (four of which are free) to take charge of your health and help your doctors determine a diagnosis for your chronic condition.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ask your pharmacist some questions. </strong></h2><p>If you haven't befriended your pharmacist, it's time to get to know them on a first-name basis. For starters, the only times these health professionals are <em>not</em> available are after hours or when they're at lunch. Pharmacists have a wealth of practical medical knowledge and can provide insight into your health and help you access temporary relief. They can also suggest the next steps, including the types of specialists to see, the best urgent care location in town, and even how to get an earlier appointment. My pharmacist is Hannah, and I won't fill a prescription anywhere else. She's a phone call or eight minutes away by car and is always happy to talk with me. I've sought her advice on everything from tennis elbow to my heart. She knows me better than most doctors and speaking with her costs me zero dollars. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take advantage of telehealth appointments. </strong></h2><p>I had reservations about telehealth doctors, but once I realized I could get an appointment the same day or within the week, I decided to give it a try. I've been able to get prescriptions and referrals for specialists within hours instead of waiting for my PCP to get back to me. The appointments are free through my health insurance and include nurses for non-urgent care, doctors for more specialized concerns, mental health visits, and sexual wellness check-ins. It's a great way to get a quick second opinion while waiting to see a specialist in person. (<em>Tip: </em>always ask to be put on a doctor’s office waiting list and see if there's a weekly time to check in to inquire about cancellations.) Plus, you can show up in your PJs and never leave your bed, which is a huge bonus. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Start candid conversations with friends and family.  </strong></h2><p>This may seem like a no-brainer, but oftentimes, we minimize our symptoms or don't let on how much pain we're in because we don't want to alarm our loved ones. Emotional support can go a long way in helping us navigate pain and receive the best care we can find. My uncle had a neighbor who is a nurse and read my bloodwork over the weekend instead of waiting for my doctor to call me on Monday. My aunt sent me a book on the vagus nerve with a beautiful lotus bookmark, a reminder that no matter how bad I felt, I wouldn't only get better but blossom. My friends are the best at sharing information, connecting me to their friends with similar health concerns and doctor's recommendations, and giving me emotional support. They've done my grocery shopping, brought food to my house, and never fail to ask how I am doing and won't accept "okay" as a response. They may not have all the answers, but letting people in helps me rest easier at night. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do some digging on social media. </strong></h2><p>Hear me out on this one: I'm not talking about going down a rabbit hole into the overwhelming amount of unfounded medical advice on TikTok. My go-to platform for finding social media-savvy, qualified HCPs is Instagram. There, you can get advice and resources from world-renowned experts across the globe. The U.S. isn’t always the most progressive from a healthcare perspective, so accessing different perspectives and medical research is incredibly valuable. If a doctor has a robust social media presence, chances are their website is chock full of information, free downloads, and additional resources. Even if they don't personally manage their socials, you can still slide into their DMs and ask a question. Also, I feel less alone reading some of the comments from others who are experiencing similar symptoms. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Check out wellness apps and devices.  </strong></h2><p>Nowadays, wellness devices such as a smartwatch or the Oura Ring can track everything from our sleep patterns to alerting us of an irregular heart rate or rhythm. Over time, we can share this information with our doctors to view a detailed snapshot of our health. This may sound obvious, but if we're searching for answers, data on our daily health patterns may point us in another direction. For me, data from my Apple watch led me to consider a sleep disorder as the potential underlying issue. If you already own one or more of these devices, read up on all of its health-tracking capabilities and supplementary apps designed to record data specific to your needs. This technology also takes some pressure off you by sending you reminders and organizing information.</p><p>Building a village of trusted health practitioners to determine a diagnosis can take time. Finding new doctors, scheduling visits, and stealing time from our daily schedules to get there can also be difficult to manage. By creating our own community of care, we can play a significant role in our wellness while alleviating the overwhelm that comes with uncertain health symptoms. </p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
