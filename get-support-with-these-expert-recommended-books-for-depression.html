    <main><h1>Get Support With These Expert-Recommended Books for Depression</h1><p>Understand your depression so you can overcome it </p><strong>Medically reviewed by Melissa Bronstein, LICSW</strong><p>Depression affects both the mind and the body and is much more than just feeling sad for a while. It squashes motivation for even the simplest of tasks and creates feelings of hopelessness and despair. Like a barometer, depression tells us that something is wrong, but it doesn’t tell us <em>what</em> is wrong. Complicating the condition is the fact that it is experienced differently by each person, so an individualized treatment plan is essential for recovery.</p><p>Self-help books can be a useful tool in the overall picture of successful treatment. They can be used alone but shouldn't substitute for treatment options like talk therapy and medication. We recommend sourcing books authored by licensed medical and mental health professionals. These experts have the training and experience to bring evidence-based techniques to the general public. The best books on depression also use easy-to-follow, engaging language that resonates with you. A social work and psychiatry expert from our Medical Expert Board reviewed the information in this article about what to look for in a book about depression and how books can provide support.</p><h3>Best Overall: This Is Depression: A Comprehensive, Compassionate Guide for Anyone Who Wants to Understand Depression</h3><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1dSpkq_this_is_depression_a_comprehensive_compassionate_guide_for_anyone_who_wants_to_understand_depression.jpg" alt="This Is Depression: A Comprehensive, Compassionate Guide for Anyone Who Wants to Understand Depression"><figcaption><em>.

Writing with compassion and humor, Dr. McIntosh brings evidence-based approaches in an accessible and engaging format.</p><p>An important benefit of understanding depression is being able to explain it and discuss it with friends, family members, and healthcare professionals. One of the most effective antidotes to depression is having an understanding and supportive community. This book aims to be a guide on the path out of a debilitating illness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><h3>Best for Negative Thoughts: Feeling Great: The Revolutionary New Treatment for Depression and Anxiety</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><p>Dr. Burns wrote this book after 40 years of research and over 40,000 hours spent treating people who struggle with depression.

After a detailed assessment of current feelings of depression and anxiety, Burns walks the reader through a thorough analysis of how you can crush negative thoughts, break bad habits, overcome addictions and relationship struggles, and deal with relapses in an effective way.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><h3>Best Positive Psychology-Based: Learned Hopefulness: The Power of Positivity to Overcome Depression</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><p>“Learned Hopefulness” comes straight out of the field of positive psychology, which is gaining a lot of popularity in the talk therapy world. Tomasulo begins the book by sharing his own journey to positive psychology, which began after his divorce from his wife of thirty years. Restoring a sense of hope in one’s future is a foundational challenge in depression management and recovery, and it's what helped Tomasulo get through a painful time in his own life.</p><p>With inspiring stories, effective exercises, and science-backed techniques, Dr. Tomasulo addresses depression head-on by helping people identify their strengths, challenge the self-deprecating voice of depression that lives in negative thoughts, and start again from a place of hope.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><h3>Best Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Made Simple: 10 Strategies for Managing Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Panic, and Worry</h3><p>   <strong>Buy at Amazon.com</strong>  </p><p>   <strong>Buy at Walmart.com</strong>  </p><p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a very commonly used talk therapy technique designed to identify irrational and negative thoughts and replace them with sound-minded and motivating thoughts.

Since thoughts and daily routines are indeed habits, he explores the effect changing our habits can have on our mood and asks what habits they could be replaced by. Dr. Luciani's approach argues that healthier thoughts and living habits can lead to happier feelings.</p><p>While it may seem too good to be true, Luciani's strategy is based on a simple concept: in order to overcome anxiety and depression, you need to trust yourself. The book is a guide to breaking through your own insecurity in order to build what Luciani calls "your self-trust muscle," which leads the way to freedom from depression and anxious feelings.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><h3>Best for Therapists: Maybe You Should Talk To Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed</h3><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1dSrPq_maybe_you_should_talk_to_someone_a_therapist_her_therapist_and_our_lives_revealed.jpg" alt="Maybe You Should Talk To Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed"><figcaption><em>.

We looked for books that focus on a variety of scientifically-backed methods while also being accessible and easy to read. We also selected books that are written by experienced counselors and psychotherapists, with years of experience in their field.</p><h2>What to Look for in Books About Depression</h2><h3>Easy to Read</h3><p>How many times have you picked up a self-help book only to feel overwhelmed by the language or not quite compelled enough to continue turning the pages? When looking for a book about depression, choose one that resonates with you and keeps you engaged. Gentle, understanding text that’s infused with real-world anecdotes, humor, and analogies is often easier to read.</p><h3>Expert Advice</h3><p>While it's helpful to hear perspectives on depression from a spectrum of people, it's often best to choose a book penned by a mental health expert. A mental health expert is someone who has been medically trained, has personal experience working with many types of people with depression, and has likely put in thousands of hours into the topic.</p><h3>Helpful Techniques</h3><p>Walking away from a book more equipped to understand, handle, and help cope with depression means that your time was well-spent reading those pages. Books written by credentialed mental health practitioners often contain a handful of effective techniques to help with the above. What's more, many of these techniques are based on science and research, which means they're evidence-based versus opinion.</p><p>    <strong>Is reading good for depression?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Yes, reading books on depression can help in several different ways. They can help you feel like you're finally understood and seen, and many include helpful techniques to help you work through complex feelings.</p><p>Generally speaking, reading any sort of book may help you feel better. It can help you feel calmer, take your mind off stressors, and even has long-term benefits related to memory and cognition.</p><p>Further, a study published in the Mental Health in Family Medicine found that consistent reading improved mental health and had antidepressant effects.</p><p>That said, books aren't considered a treatment for depression, nor are they a replacement for speaking with a therapist.</p><p>    <strong>Can I still read books for depression even though I don't have a diagnosis?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>Yes, you can read books about depression whether you’ve been diagnosed or not. Doing so may help you better understand your feelings and work through them. It may even inspire you to visit a mental health practitioner, or the reading may be useful for conversations you have with an existing therapist.</p><p>Also, reading books about depression—even if you’ve personally never felt depressed—can help you empathize with others who do experience depression. This can strengthen your relationships with those you care about and help you understand what depression is from a more nuanced point of view.</p><h2>Why Trust Verywell Mind</h2><p>As a Licensed Mental Health Counselor with over 15 years of experience working with clients who struggle with mental health issues, Mary K. Tatum, MS, LMHC understands the importance of finding quality resources and techniques that work for each person. Not everyone will have the same kind of healing journey, so having lots of options to choose from is vitally important to creating a lifestyle that combats depression symptoms.</p><p><em>We independently evaluate all recommended products and services.
