    <main><h1>7 Reasons You Should Eat Fruit Even Though It Contains Sugar</h1><p>It’s often recommended that people reduce their sugar intake when they’re trying to lose weight and for other health goals. But since fruits contain sugar, does that mean they’re off the (kitchen) table? </p><p>Read on to learn why the sugar in fruit impacts your body differently from added sugar in candy and soda, and why this delicious food group is one you may want to reach for more often.</p><h2>1. Fruit Sugar Isn’t the Same as Added Sugar</h2><p>Galina Mironova, a board certified naturopathic doctor in Chicago, says, “On the surface, natural sugar [such as what is found in fruit] is processed the same way in our bodies as added sugar, but when looking further, fruit sugar can be metabolized and used by the body in more positive ways, as it contains essential nutrients and many times [more] fiber.”</p><p>Research has shown that eating too much sugar has negative effects on the body. And according to Harvard Health, added sugar — sugar that is added to a food during its processing and manufacturing (and may appear on a food label as sugar or under alternate names like cane juice, high-fructose corn syrup, or malt) — doesn’t give the body any benefits. Added sugar is more like an extra that doesn’t do much good.</p><p>When you eat sugars that come naturally from fruits, it’s a different story. Fruit sugars don’t cause the same health problems as added sugars, and they contain beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.</p><h2>2. Eating Fruit Supports a Healthy Weight</h2><p>According to Emma Laing, PhD, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and director of dietetics at the University of Georgia, changes in weight can stem from various factors like genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences, but fruit sugar itself isn’t usually a primary contributor. Research also found that whole, fresh fruit does not contribute to obesity and instead may have a place in the prevention and management of excess body fat.</p><p>Few adults in the United States meet their recommended intake of 1.5- to 2-cup equivalents of fruits and 2- to 3-cup equivalents of vegetables daily, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is why the Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommend eating more fruit (and vegetables) to achieve a healthy weight. It also says that fruits, especially whole fruits, are an essential part of a healthy diet, one made up of nutrient-dense foods and beverages that contain minimal or no added sugars, sodium, or saturated fat.</p><h2>3. It’s a Healthy Snack Option</h2><p>“Snacking on fruit may be a good strategy for weight loss because fruits are nutrient-rich and high in fiber, which helps you feel full and satisfied throughout the day,” says Stephany Ayoubi, a registered dietitian with NY Nutrition Group. (That may be why fruits like bananas, blueberries, and apples are some of the top snacks eaten by Lose It! members who lost 50 pounds or more.) </p><p>While you can certainly enjoy fruits on their own, Ayoubi says that fruit paired with protein, fiber, or healthy fat — like an apple with almond butter — offers additional benefits. This combination slows down digestion and the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, helping to satiate you and keep your blood sugars balanced. As a result, you can avoid rapid blood sugar spikes and drops, which promotes more consistent energy levels throughout the day.</p><h2>4. Fruit Is Full of Vitamins and Minerals</h2><p>Eating more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants is a proven strategy to fend off chronic diseases, and fruit is a great source of them. According to Ayoubi, the nutrients in fruit help reduce inflammation in the body, which plays a key role in preventing conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Research supports this, suggesting we might not fully grasp how much fruits and veggies protect our health.</p><p>Dr. Laing says that three nutrients stand out to her when it comes to fruit — potassium, vitamin C, and folate — and that fresh, canned, frozen, and dried fruits are all good sources of these nutrients. Choosing from these varieties can help you eat plenty of fruit every day in ways that are affordable. And according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, frozen fruits can even contain more vitamins and minerals than fresh. Be sure to choose products without added sugar and syrups.</p><h2>5. It Offers a Healthy Replacement for (or an Addition to) Your Typical Dessert</h2><p>According to Ayoubi, there are a lot of yummy ways to eat fruit for dessert, including plenty of trendy options online to explore. She suggests trying simple fruit salads, frozen yogurt bark, or fun ideas like apple “nachos,” where you slice fruit, drizzle it with nut butter, and sprinkle on granola or nuts. “The natural sweetness of fruits can also satisfy cravings in a mindful way,” she says.</p><p>Ayoubi feels it’s okay to eat what you’re craving, such as chocolate, cookies, or ice cream — but suggests adding fruit alongside it to promote a healthy relationship with food. One of her personal favorites is grilled peaches with a dash of cinnamon and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p><h2>6. Fruit Provides Hydration</h2><p>Ayoubi notes that fruits contain another critical component: water.</p><p>According to The Ohio State University, fruits (and vegetables) may actually be slightly more hydrating than water due to their electrolyte content, which supports the body’s natural fluid balance, and that eating fruit with more than 80 percent water content is recommended if you’re seeking a hydration boost.</p><p>A few examples of hydrating fruits include grapefruit (92 percent), watermelon (92 percent), strawberries (91 percent), and cantaloupe (90 percent), per the USDA.</p><p>The Cleveland Clinic finds hydration to be an important factor for weight loss. Research is mixed on whether solely drinking more water helps you lose weight, but it’s pretty clear that swapping out calorie-containing drinks for water can create a calorie deficit, which supports weight loss.</p><h2>7. It’s an Easy Way to Eat More Fiber</h2><p>Dr. Mironova, Ayoubi, and Laing all point out that fruit contains fiber, another important nutrient for good health. According to Mironova, fiber has been associated with increased metabolism. Research supports the role of fiber in weight loss, including fat burning, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Fiber also helps you feel more full, which can lead to eating fewer calories.</p><p>Ayoubi explains that the soluble fiber in fruits fosters a healthy gut microbiome by feeding good bacteria. This helps lower the risk of gastrointestinal diseases and, according to research, supports a healthy weight. To maximize these health benefits, the USDA’s current dietary guidelines recommend aiming for 14 grams (g) of fiber for every 1,000 calories consumed daily. For example, 1 cup of raspberries has 64 calories and 8 g of fiber; a small pear contains 93 calories and 5 g of fiber; and a medium apple has 122 calories and 4 g of fiber, per the USDA.</p><h2>How Much Fruit Should I Be Eating?</h2><p>The average adult should aim for 1½- to 2-cup equivalents of fruit per day, says Laing, though she says this recommendation varies based on individual calorie needs and activity levels.</p><p>To visualize portion sizes, Laing suggests comparing fruits like apples or peaches to the size of your fist, which makes it easier to gauge your intake accurately. Since dried fruit is more concentrated, the standard serving size is ½-cup per serving, while fresh fruit generally has a serving size of 1 cup, per the USDA.</p><h2>Which Fruits Have the Highest and Lowest Sugar?</h2><p>Fruits vary in their sugar content. According to Mironova, higher-sugar fruits may “make the body work harder to keep the blood sugar stable and can take away from other important functions.” As studies report, the glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly a food raises your blood sugar. For fruits, this means high-sugar options like mangoes and grapes can cause a quick spike. Knowing the GI of fruits can help you pick the best options for steady energy and better blood sugar management.</p><p>“People with diabetes and PCOS need to focus on fruits that are lower in sugar content,” says Mironova, or at least fruits that are higher in fiber, she adds. Lower-sugar, high-fiber fruits like apples and berries provide a more gradual increase in blood sugar.</p><p>If you do snack on higher-sugar fruit, it will still give you plenty of benefits, and still may not have as much sugar as many common snacks and beverages.</p><p>For example, 1 cup of fresh cherries has 18 g of sugar and 87 calories. Cherries are full of nutrients, including magnesium, potassium, and vitamin C, and research has found they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, too. A 12-ounce can of cola, on the other hand, is 155 calories, with 37 g of sugar, and doesn’t offer those same impressive health benefits. </p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>While fruit contains sugar, it’s a natural source and not something that’s added, making it a healthy food to include in a weight loss diet. It also benefits your health in many ways, including adding fiber to your diet, boosting your water intake, building immunity, and even curbing your sweet tooth. These qualities and more make fruit a valuable addition to nearly any balanced eating plan.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
