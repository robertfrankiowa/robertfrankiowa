    <main><h1>Obesity and Depression: Is There a Connection?</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Melissa Nieves, LND</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Melissa Nieves, LND</strong><p>There is a strong connection between obesity and depression. If you have one of the conditions, you are more likely to have the other, although which comes first and why this occurs isn't fully understood.</p><p>Forty-three percent of adults with depression are also obese, and adults with depression are more likely to be obese than adults without depression. Effective ways to treat both conditions simultaneously exist, which can involve a combination of medical and nonmedical approaches.</p><p>This article discusses the connection between obesity and depression, risks, treatments, and how to lose weight if you have depression.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pG55b_a_woman_sitting_with_her_head_against_a_wall.jpg" alt="A woman sitting with her head against a wall"><figcaption><em>Prostock-Studio / Getty Images.

Depression is a risk factor for obesity, and obesity is a risk factor for depression, although how much one affects the other isn't clear.</p><p>Research on whether depression is more likely to cause obesity or obesity is more likely to cause depression has produced differing results.</p><h3>Conflicting Theories</h3><p>Although the connection between obesity and depression has been extensively researched, it's still not known for sure why one condition raises the risk for the other.</p><p>There is evidence of a biological connection between the two conditions. Obesity and depression share some physical mechanisms, including acute or chronic inflammation, an imbalanced gut microbiome, and gut-brain dysfunction. Adipokineand lipokinefat cells influence brain health and might also play a role in the connection between depression and obesity.</p><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Depression can lead to poor dietary choices, interrupted sleep, lack of energy, and avoiding exercise and other activities, all of which can cause weight gain.</p><p> <p>While some studies suggest a genetic connection between obesity and depression, one study found that only 12% of the genetic components of depression were shared with obesity. The research found that environmental factors, especially chronic stress, could play a role in the relationship between obesity and depression.</p><p>Another study found that having a higher fat mass increases the risk for depression but that depression doesn't increase the risk of obesity. The research theorized that the psychological effects of obesity could cause hormonal and metabolic changes in the body, including insulin resistance and inflammation, that are linked to depression.</p><p><h3>Explainer</h3><p>Long-term use of certain antidepressants can increase cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods and lead to weight gain. Antidepressants most likely to cause weight gain are:</p><ul><li>Amitriptyline</li><li>Citalopram</li><li>Mirtazapine</li><li>Nortriptyline</li><li>Trimipramine</li><li>Paroxetine</li><li>Phenelzine</li></ul><p> <h2>Risks of Living With Obesity and Depression</h2><p>Obesity and depression are both major public health concerns that negatively impact quality of life and raise the risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Having both obesity and depression also increases the risk of hypertension and high cholesterol.</p><p>Obesity and depression, either alone or together, are also associated with increased primary and specialty care visits, hospitalizations, and higher healthcare costs than those without either condition.</p><h2>Treatments to Manage Depression With Obesity</h2><p>While there are effective treatments for depression and obesity separately, there can be challenges to doing so. These challenges include seeing multiple care providers over long periods and finding access to and affording care. Current research is focusing on treatments to manage both conditions together.</p><p>One study found that a collaborative care approach combining weight-loss treatment, problem-solving psychotherapy, and antidepressant medications as needed helped reduce depression symptoms and improve weight after 12 months compared to usual care with a primary care physician.</p><p>Research also shows that weight loss through calorie-restricted diets can help improve mood and that people who've lost weight report improvement in depression symptoms. In one study, a ketogenic diet significantly reduced fat mass and depression symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis. Mediterranean and anti-inflammatory diets have also been shown to improve depression.</p><p>Probiotics and prebiotics might also help to prevent and treat obesity and depression, but more research is needed.</p><h2>How to Realistically Lose Weight While Depressed</h2><p>Losing weight through diet and exercise can be more difficult if you have depression. If you are struggling to lose weight while you're depressed, it's essential to seek help.</p><h3>Medical and Behavioral Interventions</h3><p>Anti-obesity medications and intensive behavioral therapy can help with weight loss and also counteract weight gain that some depression medications, such as antidepressants and mood stabilizers, can cause.</p><h3>Sleep</h3><p>Poor sleep is linked to both obesity and depression. Up to 75% of people with depression have trouble falling or staying asleep, and those with insomnia have up to 10 times greater risk of developing depression than people without insomnia.</p><p>Poor sleep is also associated with weight gain because sleep helps regulate hunger hormones. Inadequate sleep can cause you to eat more or make unhealthy food choices.</p><p>Adults should get seven to nine hours of quality sleep daily. Practicing good sleep habits can also help improve sleep.</p><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>If you are having ongoing trouble falling or staying asleep, or find yourself tired during the day, consult a healthcare provider.</p><p>Getting regular exercise can help with weight loss and has also been found to be effective at treating depression. Walking or jogging, yoga, and strength training, especially at intense levels, have been the most effective forms of exercise for helping depression, mainly when used in conjunction with psychotherapy and antidepressants.</p><h2>Support and Resources</h2><p>If you are struggling with depression and obesity, it's essential to get support and help. A good place to start is by speaking with your healthcare provider, a psychiatrist, or a psychologist. There are also obesity medicine clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) who are members of the Obesity Medicine Association and have received specialized training to treat obesity and obesity-related conditions.</p><p>Peer social support groups have also been found to help people successfully lose weight and keep weight off, especially if members have a shared sense of community. Support groups can also help you if you have depression by connecting you with others who are going through similar experiences and helping reduce isolation and loneliness.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>It's common for obesity and depression to occur together, although why this happens isn't fully understood. Both conditions raise the risk of having certain other health conditions and a poor quality of life.</p><p>Being depressed can make it more challenging to lose weight. If you are experiencing depression and obesity, it's important to seek support and contact a healthcare provider because effective treatments are available.</p>
