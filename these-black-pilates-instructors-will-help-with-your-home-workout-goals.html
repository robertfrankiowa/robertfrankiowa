    <main><h1>These Black Pilates Instructors Will Help With Your Home Workout Goals</h1><p>You don’t always have to hit the gym or go to a workout class to start a new exercise routine. Let’s face it, gym memberships and classes can start to get expensive every month and because of the high cost of living, sometimes it’s better to cut costs where they make the most sense.</p><p>If you don’t want to pay those hefty gym prices or exercise around tons of people daily, an at-home workout might be the best idea for you. Exercising at home takes the pressure off of having to scout for equipment at the gym and can be much easier than getting dressed and commuting to your nearest gym.</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, many people have opted for at-home workout subscriptions and YouTube channels to start their exercise routine. This was a way to still get exercise while avoiding the COVID-19 virus. In 2024, people are still choosing this option to avoid paying the high fees or worry about a commute.</p><p>Exercising at home also allows for more flexibility within people’s schedules. If you have to work in the office, exercising at home allows you to work out in the morning before work. Or people can work out in the evening after work without worrying about leaving to commute back and forth to the gym. For those who work from home, you have the convenience of not having to leave your house during your lunch break, as you can exercise at home.</p><p>While exercise videos like trap cardio, HIIT workouts, and strength and endurance have always been popular, videos on yoga and pilates are now making waves. These videos include full-body workouts, inversion yoga, flexibility, and more.</p><p>While these videos are incredibly popular, Black women are underrepresented as content creators in this area, some having not nearly as many subscribers or views as their white counterparts.</p><p>If you’re a beginner at pilates, want to try out yoga, or are looking for an alternative to the gym and exercise classes, here are ten Black instructors for pilates and exercising at home.</p><h2>IsaWelly (@Isawelly)</h2><p>Describing her practice as helping women eliminate fatigue and adopt healthier nutritional habits, Isa Welly is a Black Pilates instructor with over 276k subscribers on her channel.
