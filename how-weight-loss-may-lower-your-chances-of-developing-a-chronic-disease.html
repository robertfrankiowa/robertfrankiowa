Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Weight loss may not only boost your energy, mood, and self-esteem, but it can also reduce your risk for chronic conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, asthma, and cancer. Here’s a closer look at how losing weight can help you prevent such threats to your overall health.</p><h2>Heart Disease</h2><p>Having an overweight or obese body mass index (BMI) plays a major role in the risk of heart disease, the number one killer of both men and women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p><p>To better understand the research on weight as it relates to chronic conditions, it’s important to define BMI. While the American Medical Association has recognized issues with using BMI as a measure, some medical professionals continue to use it, and it’s the basis for a large amount of health research available today. (That said, you may choose not to consider BMI as representative of your weight status or health potential.)</p><p>BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, BMI categories include:</p><ul>  <li>Underweight = <18.5</li>  <li>Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 </li>  <li>Overweight = 25–29.9</li>  <li>Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater</li> </ul><p>“If you are an adult with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 [kg/m2], your risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is higher than adults with a BMI less than 25 [kg/m2],” explains Elizabeth Simkus, DNP, director of the Rush Prevention Center at Rush University System for Health in Chicago.</p><p>Other risk factors for heart disease, including family history, age, and ethnicity, can’t be controlled.</p><p>“However, modifiable risk factors such as the Standard American Diet, not meeting the recommended physical activity targets, being chronically sleep deprived — in quality or quantity of sleep — all increase our risk for having elevated body weight and increase risk of heart disease,” Dr. Simkus says.</p><p>Research shows that losing even a small amount — just 5 percent of body weight — can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. “For a 200-pound person, that’s a 10-pound weight loss,” Simkus says. “Many patients come to me wishing to lose more than that, but I find patients can feel hopeless if they think, ‘I need to lose at least 100 pounds.’ Breaking it down into more attainable, short-term goals can help with motivation and translate into true lifestyle change instead of a temporary diet.”</p><h2>Type 2 Diabetes</h2><p>Obesity, which causes insulin resistance, is a major risk factor for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. One study found that adults categorized with obese BMIs have more than a 12 times higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared to peers categorized as “normal weight” by BMI standards.</p><p>But losing weight can significantly decrease the odds of developing the disease.</p><p>“Weight loss of 5 to 7 percent is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes, and a weight loss of 15 percent could lead to remission of diabetes in nearly half of the patients that achieve the weight loss,” says Pamela Lobo, MD, division head of general internal medicine at Loma Linda University Health in California. </p><h2>Hypertension</h2><p>Health risks of obesity also include hypertension, or high blood pressure. That’s because adipose, or fat, tissue is not inactive, notes Simkus. “It can lead to inflammation, hormonal changes, and increased blood volume, which can all increase blood pressure,” she says.</p><p>Having high blood pressure can come with several complications, including heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.</p><p>Weight management can effectively lower blood pressure and associated heart risks. In general, blood pressure can drop about 1 mm Hg with every 2.2 pounds of weight loss, according to the Mayo Clinic. </p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>Changes in the body that can be associated with higher weight, including long-term inflammation and higher-than-normal levels of insulin and sex hormones, increase cancer risk.</p><p>According to the CDC, having an overweight or obese BMI has been linked to a higher risk of 13 types of cancer, including cancers of the ovaries, colon, breast, kidneys, liver, thyroid, uterus, gallbladder, esophagus, and pancreas. Obesity also increases the risk of multiple myeloma and a type of brain cancer called meningioma.</p><p>It’s important to note that having an overweight or obese BMI does not mean you will get cancer, but it can increase the odds. Achieving and maintaining a lower weight that is also healthy for your body can help reduce your cancer risk. </p><h2>Asthma</h2><p>An obese BMI not only increases the risk of developing asthma, but it can also worsen symptoms and make controlling the condition more difficult.</p><p>Obesity and excess weight cause more pressure on the chest wall and abdomen, which can decrease the lung volume when exhaling, making it more difficult to breathe, Dr. Lobo explains.</p><p>Additionally, “adipose [fat] tissue in individuals with obesity releases proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6, which is associated with poor asthma control,” she says.</p><h2>Arthritis</h2><p>Another health risk of obesity is arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis of the knee, says William Macaulay, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone Health in New York.</p><p>“This is because more than 85 to 90 percent of a person’s body weight is placed across the knee joint when they lift their contralateral foot off the floor/ground during walking,” he explains. “During stair climbing, these stresses rise sixfold. So a 240-pound man places 1,500 pounds of pressure across the knee during stair climbing.”</p><p>Weight management can help prevent arthritis and also limit its progression. According to the CDC, for each pound lost, there’s a 4-pound reduction in the load exerted on the knee.</p><h2>Sleep Apnea</h2><p>Having an overweight or obese BMI raises the risk of sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea. Research has found a 10 percent weight gain is associated with a sixfold increase in obstructive sleep apnea.</p><p>“In people with obesity, fat deposits in the upper respiratory tract narrow the airway,” Lobo says. “There is a decrease in muscle activity in this region, leading to hypoxic [insufficient oxygen] and apneic [pauses in breathing] episodes, resulting in sleep apnea.”</p><p>The good news is losing weight can help reverse sleep apnea. One study found that after eight weeks of weight loss and lifestyle intervention, 45 percent of adults with sleep apnea no longer needed to be treated with CPAP therapy. After six months of the intervention, which involved nutritional behavior change, aerobic exercise, sleep hygiene, and alcohol and tobacco cessation, that number increased to 62 percent.</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
