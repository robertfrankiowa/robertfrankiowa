    <main><h1>How to Avoid This Common Misdiagnosis: What A Brown Recluse Bite Looks Like</h1><p>Doctors and the public incorrectly diagnose countless suspicious red bumps and rashes as spider bites every year.</p><p>Of these, much of the blame falls on the brown recluse, a somewhat drab, venomous spider native to parts of the U.S. Yet, brown recluse bites are actually quite rare, says Rick Vetter, a retired professor of entomology at the University of California Riverside. </p><p>These misdiagnoses not only unfairly demonize spiders minding their own business, but they can also distract from other serious, treatable medical conditions that are the real cause of symptoms.</p><h2>The Misunderstood Brown Recluse Spider</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Discover Magazine" src="IMG/AA1ertH8_brown_recluse_spider_dorsal_view.jpg" alt="Brown recluse spider (dorsal view)"><figcaption><em>Brown recluse spider (dorsal view). Provided by Discover Magazine</em></figcaption></figure><p>One reason behind the frequent misdiagnoses is that doctors and the public know very little about brown recluses, making the spiders an easy scapegoat.</p><p>In many cases, however, having a basic understanding of brown recluses can rule out this spider bite diagnosis. </p><p>For starters, the range for brown recluses is limited to about 15 states within the south-central U.S. So, if you live in the Western half of the country, the Upper Midwest or the Northeast, it’s likely not related to a recluse.</p><p>Brown recluses also tend to flourish in human-modified areas, just like rats and cockroaches. In most cases, when there’s one recluse there are <i>dozens,</i> if not more<i>.</i></p><p>So, if you’re unable to find any spiders at the alleged attack site, a brown recluse likely isn’t responsible.</p><h2>What Does a Brown Recluse Look Like?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Discover Magazine" src="IMG/AA1errmx_brown_recluse_spider_shows_violin_marking.jpg" alt="Brown recluse spider shows violin marking"><figcaption><em>Brown recluse spider shows violin marking. Provided by Discover Magazine</em></figcaption></figure><p>Adding to the confusion, most people couldn’t identify a recluse from a lineup of harmless brown spiders. </p><p>“To most people, there are four spiders in America – tarantula, black widow, brown recluse and either a jumping spider or a garden spider,” says Vetter, adding a bit of humor: “It's easy to identify a tarantula and a black widow — and maybe a jumping spider. All the other 4,000 species in North America [must be] brown recluses.”</p><p>A dorsal view of the brown recluse spider shows its violin-shaped trademark. Unfortunately, the misidentification of other spiders as brown recluses leads to a false perception of their widespread presence, creating an exaggerated sense of risk.</p><p>In reality, as the name suggests, recluses tend to keep to themselves. They never build their webs out in the open, but rather hide them in tight, dark spaces.</p><h2>What Does a Brown Recluse Bite Look Like?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Discover Magazine" src="IMG/AA1eriLu_brown_recluse_spider_bite.jpg" alt="Brown recluse spider bite"><figcaption><em>Brown recluse spider bite. Provided by Discover Magazine</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the rare event that a brown recluse does bite a human, only about 10 percent of cases have serious consequences. Vetter outlines four tiers of recluse bites: </p><ul><li><p><b>Tier 1</b> represents the majority of bites: “Virtually nothing happens,” he says, and the bite heals on its own.</p></li><li><p>Similar to tier 1, <b>tier 2 </b>bites heal on their own. The only difference is that these bites also bring with them a symmetrical rash around the bite area. </p></li><li><p>Only about 1 in 10 recluse bites fall into <b>tier 3</b>. These bites turn necrotic, meaning blood flow gets shut down around the bite and cells that are deprived of oxygen start to die.</p></li><li><p><b>Tier 4 </b>holds less than 1 percent of recluse bites, which leads to a condition called “systemic loxoscelism.” In these rare-yet-potentially-deadly cases, the capillary bed is destroyed causing hemoglobin to float freely in the blood. As a result, bite victims have dark, almost cola-colored urine. Bites in this tier require immediate medical attention.</p></li></ul><h2>What Else Could This Bump Be?</h2><p>While the medical literature is full of instances of conditions being misdiagnosed as brown recluse bites, that leaves the burning question: What are they really?</p><p>The culprits fall into several broad categories: </p><ul><li><p>Bacterial, fungal or viral infections</p></li><li><p>Reactions to medication</p></li><li><p>Bites from insects or other arthropods</p></li><li><p>Other medical conditions</p></li></ul><p>Also, why are medical professionals so quick to overlook these other conditions in favor of a recluse diagnosis?</p><p>Part of the problem, in Vetter’s opinion, starts in medical school, where an incorrect diagnosis of a spider bite can be used to teach students – creating a misdiagnosis feedback loop.</p><h2>Consequences of Misdiagnosis</h2><p>Misdiagnosing a skin lesion as a recluse bite comes with a wide range of consequences.</p><p>On the most harmless end of the spectrum, the problem fixes itself, and you have a nice story to tell your friends. “ ‘I survived a spider bite’ just sounds cooler than ‘I survived a bacterial infection,’ ” jokes Vetter.</p><p>However, on the opposite end of the spectrum, a misdiagnosis could mean overlooking a serious condition that requires medical attention. </p><p>For example, Lyme disease, which responds well to early antibiotic treatment, may be wrongly identified as a recluse bite because both can cause a rash around the bite site. Failure to properly treat Lyme can allow the disease to progress and lead to lasting health problems.</p><p>In the same vein, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> or MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant and deadly bacterial infection, can be confused with recluse bites. If left untreated, MRSA can enter the bloodstream and quickly turn deadly. </p><h2>Making Informed Diagnoses</h2><p>Spider bite diagnoses seem to have eluded the principles of evidence-based medicine, some experts argue.</p><p>“It's amazing,” Vetter says, “how [doctors] are so willing to blame spiders.”</p><p>To ensure accurate diagnoses for all conditions, it’s essential to give credit where credit is due and rely on evidence rather than mere hunches or hype.</p></main>
