Most people take these symptoms lightly as they usually last a few seconds and then disappear. However, if ignored, this can lead to fatal diseases like vascular dementia or stroke. Let’s take a look at the foods and postures that can prevent orthostatic hypotension.</p> </blockquote><figure><img title="Provided by Gangnamtimes" src="IMG/AA1jktQ8_ignoring_this_disease_could_lead_you_straight_to_dementia_heres_what_you_need_to_do.jpg" alt="Ignoring This Disease Could Lead You Straight to Dementia: Here’s What You Need to Do"><figcaption><em>Photo for reference / Madrolly-shutterstock.com.

Many people mistake orthostatic hypotension for anemia because the symptoms are similar. However, the two are entirely different.</p><p>Orthostatic hypotension is caused by decreased pressure within the blood vessels due to heart function abnormalities. On the other hand, anemia is a blood disorder caused by a lack of hemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood. These two conditions are distinctly different.</p><p>The best way to treat a disease is to start with easy-to-implement methods, like diet. To prevent orthostatic hypotension, it’s beneficial to consume fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins A and C, as well as dietary fiber, which helps improve blood circulation. So, what foods can help prevent orthostatic hypotension?</p><h2><strong>1. Spinach</strong></h2><p>Spinach is a representative food that is good for preventing orthostatic hypotension. Green vegetables like spinach or cabbage are rich in nitrates. Nitrates in the body turn into nitric oxide, which expands blood vessels and improves circulation.</p><p>According to a study by Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the risk of dementia in old age is 40% higher for those who suffer from orthostatic hypotension in middle age. Vitamins K, lutein, folic acid, and beta-carotene in spinach help keep the brain young and prevent dementia.</p><h2><strong>2. Carrots</strong></h2><p>Carrots are rich in beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is an antioxidant that enhances immunity, improves blood circulation, reduces the risk of heart disease and cancer, and is known to be good for vision and eye health.</p><p>Beta-carotene is usually found in the peel, so it’s recommended to eat carrots with the peel. If that’s difficult, it’s also good to grind them in a blender and drink it like juice.</p><h2><strong>3. Dairy Products such as Cheese and Milk</strong></h2><p>Vitamin B12, which is abundant in dairy products, greatly helps maintain normal blood pressure and also promotes blood circulation. Regular consumption of dairy products or vitamin supplementation can effectively prevent orthostatic hypotension.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Gangnamtimes" src="IMG/AA1jkwDc_ignoring_this_disease_could_lead_you_straight_to_dementia_heres_what_you_need_to_do.jpg" alt="Ignoring This Disease Could Lead You Straight to Dementia: Here’s What You Need to Do"><figcaption><em>Photo for reference / Ekaterina Bondaretc-shutterstock.com.

Garlic</strong></h2><p>Garlic, a staple ingredient in Korean cuisine, also shows excellent effects in preventing orthostatic hypotension.</p><p>The scordinin in garlic stimulates blood circulation and metabolism. Allicin, which gives garlic its unique spicy smell, also aids blood circulation.</p><p>However, if you have a blood clotting disorder or are taking blood thinners, you should consult your doctor before increasing your garlic intake.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Gangnamtimes" src="IMG/AA1jkBtt_ignoring_this_disease_could_lead_you_straight_to_dementia_heres_what_you_need_to_do.jpg" alt="Ignoring This Disease Could Lead You Straight to Dementia: Here’s What You Need to Do"><figcaption><em>Photo for reference / Dionisvera-shutterstock.com. Provided by Gangnamtimes</em></figcaption></figure><p>Firstly, walnuts contain arginine, ALA, and vitamin E, which stimulate the production of nitric oxide in the body. This helps expand the blood vessels, aiding in blood circulation.</p><p>Almonds are also rich in vitamin E, which slows down the aging of the blood vessel walls and facilitates smooth blood circulation. However, consuming too many can cause gastrointestinal disorders or diarrhea, so it is recommended to eat only about a handful or 23 nuts per day.</p><p>To prevent orthostatic hypotension, it is important to <strong>improve your lifestyle habits</strong>.</p><p>The first habit to adopt is to move your body slowly. If the symptoms are severe, try the following: ▲wear compression stockings on your legs, ▲wear an abdominal belt ▲eat slowly ▲sleep with your head elevated by about 15-20 degrees ▲drink 2 liters (about half a gallon) of water a day ▲avoid salty foods (ultimately adopting a low-salt diet can have the opposite effect. Eating moderately stimulating foods can help raise blood pressure) ▲avoid excessive drinking ▲do lower body strength exercises.</p><p>However, even if you prevent orthostatic hypotension, it’s useless if you don’t know how to <strong>deal with it</strong> when symptoms appear.</p><p>Falling due to orthostatic hypotension can lead to disasters such as falls, fractures, and fainting. So, it’s good to remember postures that can alleviate symptoms.</p><p>The best way to prevent secondary accidents due to orthostatic hypotension is to ‘lie down.’ This allows blood to be quickly supplied to the brain, eliminating symptoms. However, if you’re in a place where it’s difficult to lie down, like an office or subway, you should adopt a posture that puts strength in your lower body. Applying strength to the lower body causes the leg blood to contract sharply and quickly sends blood to the upper body.</p><p>A representative posture is ‘crossing your legs while standing.’ You can also try this posture while sitting. Before getting up after sitting for a long time, cross your legs for about 15-30 seconds.</p><p>According to a research team at the University of Calgary in Canada, the group that crossed their legs after standing had an average blood pressure drop of 18mmHg.</p><p>On the other hand, the group that stood up usually showed a blood pressure drop of 28mmHg, and the group that repeated knee lifts after standing showed a drop of 20mmHg.</p><p>The prestigious journal ‘The Lancet Neurology’ also reported that crossing your legs while standing, lifting your heels, and placing one foot on a chair can help with orthostatic hypotension. The common point of these postures is that they apply strength to the muscles of the lower body, such as the thighs and calves, facilitating the flow of blood from the leg veins to the heart.</p><p>So, where should you go if you suspect orthostatic hypotension but are unsure? <strong>Which hospital</strong> should you visit?</p><p>If you suspect you have orthostatic hypotension, you should visit a cardiologist and undergo a tilt table test. In this test, the healthcare provider will secure you to a table, then tilt the table to a nearly 90-degree angle while continuously measuring your pulse, blood pressure, and any symptoms of dizziness.</p><p>By.
