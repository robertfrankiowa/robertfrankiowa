    <main><h1>15 Low-Calorie, Low-Fat Foods To Try</h1><strong>Medically reviewed by Barbie Cervoni, RD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Barbie Cervoni, RD</strong><p>A low-calorie diet involves cutting daily caloric intake without cutting back on nutrients. For many people, the purpose of a low-calorie diet is weight loss, which may be achieved by focusing on burning more calories than you consume, among other elements.</p><p>Losing weight may help reduce the risk of weight-related conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Some people may also try a low-calorie diet for general health and longevity.</p><p>If you aim to consume fewer calories, it's best to have a balanced, varied diet that prioritizes nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and plant-based options. Include healthier unsaturated fats while limiting saturated and trans fats to reduce their negative health effects, as fat is crucial for energy production and nutrient absorption.</p><p>Here are 15 low-calorie, low-fat foods from various food groups to support your wellness goals, plus simple ways to integrate them into meals.</p><h2>1. Leafy Greens</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1omcQm_a_set_of_greens_for_salads_leaves_of_curly_salad_lettuce_and_basil.jpg" alt="A set of greens for salads: leaves of curly salad, lettuce and basil"><figcaption><em>Olenaa / Getty Images.

They're highly versatile, which makes them a staple in salads and wraps. Add a handful of leafy greens to a smoothie, soup, or pasta.</p><p>Spinach is a popular, neutral-tasting leafy green that can go in any dish.

Apples</h2><p>Apples are high in fiber and water. They can be a satisfying on-the-go snack, especially when paired with food containing protein and fat, such as nuts or nut butter.

Skinless poultry is often recommended as a substitute for red meat as it's lower in saturated fat. Choose healthy ways to prepare chicken such as grilling, baking, or roasting.</p><p>A 3-ounce portion of grilled, skinless, and boneless chicken provides 128 calories, 2.69 g of fat, and 25.9 g of protein. Poultry is also a good source of B vitamins and minerals like iron and zinc.</p><h2>4. Canned Light Tuna in Water</h2><p>Canned light tuna in water is a lean source of protein and is typically lower in calories and fat than canned tuna in oil.

Add a scoop of canned tuna to a salad bowl or spread tuna salad on toast or wraps.</p><h2>5. Popcorn</h2><p>Popcorn is a whole grain snack, with three cups of air-popped popcorn offering just 93 calories, 1.09 grams of fat, 3.09 g of protein, and 3.48 g of fiber.</p><p>To keep it healthy, skip the movie-style popcorn and opt for plain popcorn, flavoring it with a drizzle of olive oil, a little sea salt, and your favorite spices instead of loads of butter and salt.</p><h2>6. Watermelon</h2><p>Refreshing and hydrating, watermelon is low in calories and can help satisfy sweet cravings. A single cup of diced raw watermelon is mostly water (91% in weight). It has 45.6 calories, 0.228 g of fat, and 14% of the daily value for vitamin C.</p><p>Enjoy watermelon as a refreshing snack, blend it into smoothies, or add it to fruit salads.</p><h2>7. Lentils</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Health" src="IMG/BB1omajW_lentils_on_a_wooden_table.jpg" alt="Lentils on a wooden table"><figcaption><em>Westend61 / Getty Images.

Greek Yogurt (Low-Fat or Non-Fat)</h2><p>High in protein and calcium, plain Greek yogurt is a creamy, filling low-calorie snack or breakfast. Top with low-sugar granola, fruit, and nuts for a complete meal. You can also make a savory dip with plain Greek yogurt, olive oil, and seasonings.</p><p>A 7-ounce (200 grams) container of plain low-fat Greek yogurt has 146 calories and 3.84 g of fat, while a 170-gram container of plain non-fat Greek yogurt has 100 calories and 0.66 g of fat. Some yogurts contain live probiotics, as stated on the label. These are beneficial bacteria that can support healthy digestion.</p><h2>9. Broccoli</h2><p>Nutrient-dense and low-calorie, broccoli can be enjoyed steamed, roasted, or stir-fried. Broccoli is part of the cruciferous vegetables group that includes cabbage and cauliflower.

Egg Whites</h2><p>Egg whites are packed with protein and have very few calories and little fat compared to whole eggs. Egg yolks contain protein and other nutrients like vitamin D and choline, but egg whites are an excellent alternative for those mindful of fat and calorie intake. Look for them in powdered or liquid form at the grocery store.</p><p>A single ounce of dried egg whites delivers 107 calories, 22,7 g of protein, and zero fat grams. Use egg whites in omelets and scrambles. Egg white powder can be added to smoothies for a protein boost.</p><h2>13. Oats</h2><p>Oats are a great low-calorie base for hot breakfast cereal and homemade snack bars. They contain beta-glucan, a type of fiber that can lower cholesterol and blood sugars, support gut health, and suppress appetite.</p><p>One cup of instant oats prepared with water offers 159 calories, 3.18 g of fat, 5.55 g of protein, and 3.98 g of fiber. Oats are a good source of nutrients like iron, magnesium, and vitamin B1.</p><h2>14.

Bell peppers are a great source of phenolic compounds and carotenoids, which are beneficial plant compounds with antioxidant effects.</p><h2>15. Black Beans</h2><p>Black beans are often considered the most versatile beans due to their mild flavor and ability to adapt to various cuisines and dishes. They can be used in soups, salads, tacos, burritos, dips, and more. They're widely available, and you can find them in the store in dried or canned form.</p><p>A 100-gram portion of boiled black beans delivers 132 calories, 0.54 g of fat, and 8.86 g of protein.
