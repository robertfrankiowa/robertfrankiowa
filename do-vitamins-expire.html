    <main><h1>Do Vitamins Expire?</h1><p>Yes. A registered dietitian explains.</p><p>Vitamins are substances your body needs for normal functioning. Obtaining all the vitamins you need from food is possible in most circumstances. However, there are times when a vitamin supplement is required. </p><p>Dietary supplements encompass vitamins, minerals, herbs, and many other products. Vitamin products contain either one or a combination of the 13 essential vitamins. Multivitamin formulations generally combine vitamins, minerals, and other compounds associated with health benefits. </p><p>Vitamins fill nutrient gaps to support health and prevent illness. Using vitamins when they are still good ensures you are meeting your nutrient needs.</p><p>This article will explain the factors influencing vitamin shelf life, address common misconceptions, and provide guidance on determining if your vitamins are still adequate.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oOm9L_person_reading_the_label_on_a_bottle_of_medicine_at_a_pharmacy.jpg" alt="Person reading the label on a bottle of medicine at a pharmacy."><figcaption><em>d3sign / Getty Images Person reading the label on a bottle of medicine at a pharmacy..

However, manufacturers may list an expiration date on the vitamin package if valid data supports it. </p><p>Expiration dates on vitamins reflect the day up to when a manufacturer can guarantee the supplement’s full strength (potency) and safety. Manufacturers must provide evidence that the product has been tested to retain 100% potency throughout its shelf life. </p><p>Generally, manufacturers list a shelf life of two years, provided vitamins are kept in their original packaging and stored in optimal conditions.    </p><p>Likewise, best-by dates are not required on supplements. Still, some manufacturers may include one. The best-by date represents when you should use the supplement for the best taste and texture. It is unrelated to the vitamin’s strength.</p><p>Certain vitamin levels are necessary for health and to prevent illness. Vitamins are intended to supplement the diet, filling nutrient gaps caused by dietary preferences, allergies, or not eating enough.</p><p>Adhering to vitamin expiration dates ensures you get the nutrient dosage listed on the supplement and the nutrition you need. </p><h2>Factors That Influence Shelf Life</h2><p>All vitamins will lose strength over time, but certain environmental factors can accelerate the process. </p><p>Many factors influence shelf life. Some are controllable, while others affect vitamin potency before the supplement reaches your shelf. Some of the vitamin’s strength is lost during production. Poor storage—during production, at the store, and at home—can further contribute to decreased shelf life.</p><p>Oxygen exposure, light, humidity, and temperature affect vitamin shelf life. Temperature is especially important. </p><p>Vitamins kept at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C) lose less nutrients than those stored at higher temperatures. One study found liquid supplements with vitamin D kept their potency for longer when stored at 77 degrees Ft compared to 104 degrees F.</p><h2>Why Some Vitamins May Not Last as Long</h2><p>The vitamin type and supplement form can influence a vitamin's shelf life.</p><p>Fat-soluble vitamins like A and E are more sensitive to light and oxygen and degrade faster in these conditions. </p><p>The shelf life of water-soluble vitamins (B vitamins and vitamin C) depends on the vitamin and storage conditions. For example, thiamine (vitamin B1) loses potency when its pH range increases (becomes more basic), causing it to become less stable. Vitamin C is sensitive to oxygen, light, heat, and storage temperature and duration. </p><p>Solid vitamins like pills, tablets, powders, and capsules last longer than liquid supplements. Chewables and tablet vitamins are more stable than liquid but degrade faster than capsule supplements. Chewables and tablets are not encapsulated, so they are more exposed to air and moisture.</p><p>Liquid vitamins often have stricter storage requirements, making them more susceptible to nutrient loss if not cared for properly. Nevertheless, liquid vitamins may go bad before an expiration date. </p><p>Recommendations vary regarding the shelf life of opened liquid vitamins. Moreover, many manufacturers do not list a time frame for consuming the vitamin after opening.  </p><p>Still, it is recommended that an opened liquid vitamin be used within one year. However, it is recommended that children or infants use them within ten months.  </p><h2>Are Expired Vitamins Safe to Take?</h2><p>Limited evidence suggests expired vitamins cause harm. Still, vitamins can mold, and consuming moldy vitamins is discouraged.</p><p>Although expired vitamins may be safe to take, they will not be as effective. Vitamins fill nutrient gaps or improve nutrition-related labs. Expired vitamins are less potent and may not meet nutrition needs and desired outcomes.</p><p>Potency is essential when taking vitamins to address a deficiency. If you have expired supplements on your shelf, discard them and purchase new ones. Expired vitamins are not as potent as when new, so they may not resolve a nutrient deficiency.</p><h2>Testing for Potency</h2><p>A vitamin's true potency can only be evaluated with lab analysis. However, you can take steps to assess your vitamin's strength at home.</p><p>Examine how the vitamin looks and smells before taking it, especially if it is close to or after its expiration date.</p><p>Dull coloring, cracks, or other textural changes can mean the vitamin has gone bad. Liquid vitamins may smell foul, change color, or contain bubbles. </p><p>Safely discard any vitamins with an altered appearance or smell.</p><h2>Storage Tips</h2><p>Store vitamins in a dry, cool place away from light. Research shows that medications properly stored in dry, cool, and dark places can retain 90% of their potency for five years or more beyond the expiration date.</p><p>Limit exposure to heat and humidity, both of which reduce vitamin potency. Keep vitamins in an airtight container to avoid exposure to oxygen. Liquid vitamins may need to be stored in the refrigerator.</p><p>Although vitamins are frequently stored in the bathroom, an alternative may be worth considering. Bathrooms can be humid environments with fluctuating temperatures. </p><p>If you purchase vitamins in bulk, utilize the first-in, first-out rule of storage and safety. Place items with the earliest expiration date in the front and those with the latest date in the back. This ensures you consume vitamins with a shorter shelf life first.</p><h2>How to Discard Vitamins</h2><p>The FDA recommends disposing of unused medications through a take-back program. Medication take-back programs are sites registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency that collect unused or expired medications for safe disposal. </p><p>If a medication take-back location is unavailable, the FDA provides additional guidance for discarding unused or expired medications. Most vitamins are on the no-flush list, meaning they should be disposed of in your trash. </p><p>Use the following steps to discard vitamins safely:</p><ul><li>Mix liquids or pills (do not crush) with trash, such as dirt, cat litter, compost, or used coffee grounds. </li><li>Place the mixture in a closed container, plastic bag, or directly into a compost bin. </li><li>Dispose of the container or bag in your home trash. </li></ul><p>Only unused addictive medications that can harm household members or pets should be flushed down the toilet if no take-back program is available.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found no negative environmental effects from flushing vitamins. Still, the FDA wants to avoid unnecessarily contaminating the water system with improper medication disposal. </p><h2>Common Misconceptions</h2><p>Vitamins can lose potency before expiration. Because of this, some manufacturers intentionally increase the amount of vitamins in their products. Others may do so unintentionally. Still, try taking vitamins well ahead of their expiration date. </p><p>In particular, avoid vitamins past their expiration date if your blood work shows a nutrient deficiency—even if you already have that vitamin on your shelf.</p><h2>Guidance for Purchasing</h2><p>Purchasing vitamins can be overwhelming, given the number of available options. However, strategies exist to help you choose a safe and potent vitamin.</p><p>Always check the expiration date before purchasing vitamins. Consider the number of capsules in the bottle, how often you will take the vitamin, and whether you will finish it well before the expiration date. </p><p>If purchasing vitamins in bulk, be sure you will take them before they expire.</p><p>Look for products that list specific nutrient quantities. Avoid vitamins containing proprietary ingredient blends, especially those that do not list the product's components and amounts on the label. Proprietary blends can contain undesired vitamins or compounds.</p><p>Because vitamins are not well regulated, opt for a third-party tested product. Third-party testing ensures an additional level of safety. However, third-party testing does not reflect product efficacy; it only ensures a product contains the nutrients claimed.</p><p>When purchasing vitamins, choose ones certified by NSF.org, U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), and ConsumerLab.com, three reputable testing organizations..</p><h2>When to Consult Your Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Nutrient needs vary throughout life. A vitamin supplement can support increased nutrient needs in individuals who are pregnant or lactating. Similarly, vitamin supplements can benefit older adults who cannot get sufficient nutrients from food.</p><p>Vitamin supplements can help ensure you meet nutrient requirements despite food allergies or specific diets like vegan or ketogenic. Individuals who do not regularly consume certain food groups, such as those who avoid meat, may want to consider a vitamin supplement. </p><p>Individuals with known vitamin deficiencies should consult a healthcare professional for guidance in choosing a supplement.</p><p>Your registered dietitian or pharmacist can help with personalized vitamin and supplement recommendations. They are also equipped to answer questions about vitamins, including deciphering expiration dates.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Expiration dates on vitamins reflect a decrease in potency. Although expired vitamins may be safe to consume, they may be less effective. </p><p>If you take an expired vitamin, inspect it for mold, textural changes, or odor. Store vitamins in a cool, dry, and dark area to help retain potency before their expiration date.</p></main>
