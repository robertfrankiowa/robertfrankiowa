I was more annoyed by how thin the walls were. My smartwatch showed a heart rate spike that night, and it wasn’t the first time. I’d been jolting awake in excruciating pain for two years. </p><p>  I decided to do an at-home sleep study, but the results came back inconclusive. My psychiatrist and I decided I was having panic attacks in my sleep — this was during sporadic pandemic shutdowns. </p><p>  I’ve had trouble sleeping since I was young. My parents had my tonsils removed when I was 4 years old because of sleep apnea and ear infections, and after a sleepless adolescence, I was put on medication to help with insomnia at age 18. Still, the issue continued when I went to college, this time joined by a searing pain in my chest and back during the middle of the night. </p><p>  I’d wake up, heart thumping, and chug water to make the pain go away, but it always returned the next night. I considered the possibility it was my fan blowing dust into my face, but replacing it did nothing. I remember thinking, “Something’s really wrong with me.” </p><h2>  Worsening symptoms </h2><p>  After I graduated, I went to a homeopath because my symptoms were getting worse — and weirder. Traditional medicine wasn’t offering me relief. I’d wake up in a coughing fit with water streaming from my nose. My energy was constantly drained, which made work and social interactions harder, and my mental health stagnated. My throat would close up in the middle of eating something, such as apples or rice, and if I was dining with others, I’d have to excuse myself to the bathroom, where sometimes I’d throw up. </p><p>  I removed gluten from my diet and started taking herbal supplements. I avoided eating at night. But the homeopath couldn’t offer any clear explanations. We assumed it was GERD — gastroesophageal reflux disease. Far enough out from shutdowns, I decided to do another sleep study, this time in person. </p><p>  It was the worst sleep of my life, attached to wires and monitored by cameras. The technician looked at me with sympathy the next morning and said: “Do you want me to write you a note to stay home from work?” I declined, determined to soldier through. When I met with the pulmonologist for my results, he said I stopped breathing 300 times in eight hours. </p><p>  I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and prescribed a CPAP machine. Something still felt wrong. The vomiting was getting worse, swallowing was difficult, and the chest pain was sharper. I met with a gastroenterology specialist who was immediately concerned. She booked me for an endoscopy, coincidentally the same week I was scheduled for a breast biopsy. </p><p>  Within 30 minutes of going under for the endoscopy, I was pulled from the procedure. Despite fasting, my esophagus was clogged. The doctors scheduled me for a barium swallow test, also known as an esophagram, to measure how my esophagus was draining. </p><p>  Then I found out I had a breast tumor. Without knowing the extent of the cancer, pressure about receiving results from my next endoscopy ramped up. During the procedure, the doctors took biopsies and excavated the debris from my esophagus. </p><h2>  A diagnosis </h2><p>  The tests came back negative for cancer, but images showed signs of something called achalasia. </p><p>  Achalasia is a rare swallowing disorder, which researchers believe affects an estimated 20,000-40,000 U.S. patients. The condition occurs when esophageal muscles have trouble contracting, causing issues with swallowing and regurgitation. Its cause is unknown. </p><p>  I transitioned to an achalasia specialist as I began treatment for Stage 2 breast cancer. The specialist was hesitant to diagnose achalasia without a manometry, a test where a pressure-sensitive tube is eased down your throat while awake. I broke into tears, unwilling to submit myself to more invasive procedures. We were both in agreement — get through cancer, then we’ll deal with the swallowing problems. </p><p>  Unfortunately, that sentiment was short-lived. After my first round of chemotherapy, my throat closed up. Swallowing food and water felt like swallowing rocks. After two days with minimal sustenance, I went to the emergency room in the same hospital system as my gastroenterology doctor in the hopes I could fast track my treatment. I was kept overnight, and the next day underwent an endoscopy with a specialist — another diagnostic option — confirming I had achalasia. </p><p>  I had three options for treatment: pneumatic dilation, where the esophageal sphincter is inflated by a balloon; a Heller myotomy, where the esophageal muscles are cut into; or a peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), similar to the Heller but with an incision to the esophageal lining. I opted for the latter, wanting the procedure with the most long-term benefits. </p><p>  During the breathing tube placement for the procedure, bile and water went into my lungs because of the blockages in my esophagus. While the POEM procedure was successful, I ended up in the hospital for eight days with pneumonia and irritated esophageal lining. I had to work my way from pure liquids to soft foods before I could leave, and even then, I threw up my pills for a couple of weeks. </p><h2>  Four years to find and treat </h2><p>  Achalasia is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning it worsens over time. Also, my breast cancer acted like an autoimmune disorder, aggravating my achalasia. </p><p>  Start to finish, the worst of my achalasia symptoms took almost four years to find and treat. My end tally was four esophagrams, three endoscopies, two chest X-rays, two chest MRIs and one POEM procedure. Compared to cases where people drop significant weight or the disease’s effects are irreversible, I got off easy. </p><p>  I also went through chemotherapy, surgery and radiation for breast cancer. Now I don’t show evidence of the disease, but I’ll continue targeted therapy treatments. </p><p>  Achalasia prevented me from enjoying my life, casting a layer of exhaustion and discomfort onto everyday experiences. I thought I was imagining the pain for years. Without increased health problems, I’m not sure how long it would’ve taken to get treated and diagnosed, fit onto a busy roster of others with pressing GI issues. </p><p>  I regret spending years dismissing my own pain. Having a word for my condition helped me reclaim the time I lost. The POEM procedure greatly increased my quality of life by reducing choking incidents and chest pain. It still takes longer for me to eat and digest. </p><p>  Even though achalasia is something I’ll have to monitor for the rest of my life, now, I feel like I can finally breathe again. Quite literally. </p></main>
