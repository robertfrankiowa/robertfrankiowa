    <title>These Healthy Snacks Ideas Are Nutritious and Taste Great</title>
    <meta name="description" content="From oatmeal to avocado toast to hummus, you’ll actually want to reach for these. When trying to lose weight, you may consider nixing snacks from your diet. But reaching for the right snacks can actually aid in your weight loss plan. Wholesome nibbles can help you stay satisfied between meals, and healthy snacks for weight loss will make you less likely to feel ravenous and more likely to stick to your goals. A healthy snack can also quell cravings and ward off feelings of deprivation. The only catch: It’s not always obvious which snacks are actually satisfying and nutritious. We all know a nutrient-deficient bag of chips or processed, sugary sweets may not be the most beneficial bite, so what exactly counts as healthy when it comes to a snack? Generally, you want to aim for foods with around 200 to 250 calories, around 10 g of protein, and 5 g of fiber, recommends Sarah Pflugradt, R.D., nutrition expert and author of You Get One Body. “That amount of calories is enough to fill you up without sending you over your daily budget.” Plus, the combo of protein and fiber will help you stay fueled until your next meal. Meet the experts: Mascha Davis, M.P.H., R.D.N., registered dietitian nutritionist and author of Eat Your Vitamins; Jessica Zinn, M.S., R.D., C.D.N., C.D.C.E.S., registered dietitian at Nutrition Energy; Kristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D., registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Wellness & Preventive Medicine; Sarah Pflugradt, R.D., nutrition expert and author of You Get One Body; and Amy Shapiro, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., founder and director of Real Nutrition. Sustainable weight loss comes from establishing foundational behavior changes that you can maintain over the long term,” says Mascha Davis, M.P.H., R.D.N., registered dietitian nutritionist and author of Eat Your Vitamins. “For snacking, I recommend choosing options that are filled with high fiber carbs, lean protein, and heart healthy fats.” She suggests consuming five to seven servings of fruits and veggies to increase your fiber intake, and eating three meals with two to three snacks per day. Some research shows that eating more of your meals earlier in the day can keep blood sugar levels stable and help you lose weight. Healthy snacks for weight loss are not limited to greens and veggies—they can be delicious too, which will better help your weight goals in the long run. “Consider personal preferences,” says Kristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D., registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Wellness & Preventive Medicine. “Studies show that when you take this important factor into your dietary pattern, you are more likely to stick with it. For example, if you don’t like kale, don’t include it—instead, find another green or cruciferous veggie that you love.” The good news is that there are a ton of healthy snacks that will curb cravings, satisfy your hunger, and aid in weight loss—all while tasting delicious. If you’re looking for some inspiration, here are the tastiest, expert-backed healthy snacks. We promise you’ll actually want to eat them!">

    <main><h1>These Healthy Snacks Ideas Are Nutritious and Taste Great</h1><h2>Cottage Cheese</h2><p>In addition to being packed with protein (around 25 g per cup), full-fat cottage cheese is rich in linoleic acid, a fatty acid that’s tied to fat loss. A study published in <em>The Journal of Nutrition</em> found that a higher intake of protein and dairy products like cottage cheese helped overweight and obese premenopausal women lose fat and gain lean muscle. Top with some fresh raspberries for a mega dose of fiber—you’ll get a whopping 8 g from 1 cup.</p><h2>Roasted chickpeas</h2><p>Eating a 3/4-cup of legumes, like chickpeas, can help you lose nearly 1 lb in six weeks without making any other changes to your diet, suggests a March 2016 review in <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>. Instead of eating them plain, try roasting your chickpeas with extra-virgin olive oil, sea salt, and a generous sprinkle of cumin or smoked paprika for a boost of flavor. Yum!</p><h2>Almonds with pomegranate seeds</h2><p>A May 2014 study from the <em>Journal of Research in Medical Sciences</em> found that overweight and obese women who ate 1 1/2 ounces of nuts as part of a low-calorie diet for three months lost more weight than women who didn’t eat nuts. Try pairing 1/4-cup almonds with 1/2-cup pomegranate seeds. The water and the fiber in the fruit will fill you up even more—not to mention satisfy your sweet tooth, says Pflugradt.</p><h2>Hummus and carrots</h2><p>Hummus is just another tasty way to get a daily helping of beans, so dig in. As for your dipper? Go for raw veggies like celery and carrots—they’re rich in carotenoids, a type of polyphenol that research suggests could help improve your insulin sensitivity as well as lower your waist circumference.</p><h2>Chia pudding</h2><p>The small-but-mighty seeds aren’t just loaded with protein and fiber. “They’re great for weight loss,” says nutrition expert Amy Shapiro, R.D.. “They hold up to 10 times their weight in water, so they expand in your stomach and help keep you full.” Try them in a sweet chia pudding with unsweetened almond milk, chopped walnuts, and dried blueberries. This recipe makes enough for two snacks, Shapiro says. Or if you’re following a plant-based diet, try this vegan coconut chia pudding. </p><h2>Apple with peanut butter</h2><p>Apples are one of the best fruits for weight loss snacking, thanks to their high-fiber content, according to a 2015 study in <em>PLOS Med</em>. Add a shot of protein and healthy fats with 2 tbsp of natural peanut butter, and you’ll be set, Pflugradt says. Just be sure to read the labels on peanut butter jars carefully and check for added sugar and oils.</p><h2>Dessert hummus with fruit</h2><p>Just like savory hummus, the sweeter variety is made with protein- and fiber-rich chickpeas that’ll fill you up for the long haul. Make your own dessert hummus by pureeing chickpeas with vanilla extract, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a touch of maple syrup for some natural sweetness. You can also pick one up at the store as a dip for fresh strawberries. Just be sure to avoid those with high amounts of added sugar–and stick to the serving size. </p><figure><img title="Dessert hummus with fruit" src="IMG/AA1860f3_dessert_hummus_with_fruit.jpg" alt="Dessert hummus with fruit"><figcaption><em>Dessert hummus with fruit.

Avocados can also improve gut health because of their unsaturated fatty acid content, which prompt greater microbial diversity and produce metabolites that support your gut bacteria. Enjoy the dip with jicama instead of the usual chips. A 1-cup serving of the sliced veggie has 6 g of belly-filling fiber and just 46 calories. Try this go-to guac recipe for your next hosting gig!</p><h2>Green smoothie</h2><p>Smoothies are a satisfying way to sneak in an extra serving of veggies, making it a great snack for weight loss. “I like a 50/50 combo of veggies and fruit with a protein add-in and a fiber-add-in,” Pflugradt says. Think a handful each of baby spinach and frozen mango with 3/4-cup low-fat milk and 1 tbsp ground flaxseeds, or a handful each of kale and frozen berries with 3/4-cup unsweetened almond milk and 1 tbsp almond butter. If you’re following a plant-based diet, try this vegan-friendly green pineapple coconut smoothie recipe!</p><h2>Savory Greek yogurt</h2><p>Swap your usual fruit or granola add-in for roasted, salted pumpkin seeds, chopped olives, or sliced cherry tomatoes, Pflugradt recommends. You’ll still get around 23 g of appetite-squashing protein per cup of yogurt. Not to mention a shot of probiotics, which could help you shed up to 4% of your body fat in just six weeks, research suggests. Find our list of the best yogurt brands here. </p><h2>Baked sweet potato with nut or seed butter</h2><p>Sweet potatoes aren’t just for lunch or dinner. The sweet flavor paired with 6 g of fiber make the orange tubers a satisfying snack, too. Add a protein-rich topper for more staying power—like a tablespoon of almond butter or tahini. </p><h2>Oatmeal with cinnamon</h2><p>Why limit something as good as oatmeal to just breakfast? Research shows that oats are rich in beta-glucans, a type of soluble fiber that boosts satiety. Pflugradt recommends cooking 1/4-cup rolled or steel-cut oats with 1/2-cup 2% milk for a filling combo of fiber and protein. Top with your favorite fruit plus a sprinkle of cinnamon—studies suggest that the spice could help promote stable blood-sugar levels.</p><h2>Pears with parmesan cheese</h2><p>One medium pear packs nearly 6 g of fiber. Enjoy it with an ounce of Parmesan cheese, which is protein-packed and makes for a yummy sweet-salty combo, says Shapiro. </p><h2>Mini frittatas</h2><p>The protein in eggs has been shown to keep hunger hormones at bay and promote weight loss. But if you’re bored with snacking on hard-boiled ones, try a classic spinach and tomato combo. Even better, shake things up by making bite-sized frittatas in a mini muffin tin.</p><h2>Edamame</h2><p>Your favorite sushi appetizer is a great snack to reach for if you’re watching your weight. Help yourself to a cup of the soybean pods, Shapiro recommends. You’ll get a whopping 18 g of protein and 8 g of fiber, which will help keep you going until your next meal. </p><h2>Pistachios</h2><p>Craving something salty? Try protein- and fiber-rich pistachios. According to a June 2010 study in the <em>Journal of American College of Nutrition</em>, pistachios can be consumed as a portion-controlled snack for individuals restricting calories to lose weight without concern that pistachios will cause weight gain. In comparison to snacks such as pretzels, pistachios may have beneficial effects on triglycerides as well, per the study. </p><h2>Split pea soup</h2><p>It might seem like an odd choice for a snack, but get this: The protein in split peas has been shown to help reduce hunger more than the protein from dairy foods like Greek yogurt, a 2011 study in <em>Nutrition Journal </em>found. In fact, just 1 cup of split pea soup serves up 10 g of protein—along with 5 g of fiber.</p><h2>Blueberry toast</h2><p>Spread a slice of whole-grain toast with 1 tbsp of almond butter and top with mashed blueberries (frozen berries that have been thawed are fine!). You’ll get a combo of protein, healthy fat, and fiber along with an extra boost: Anthocyanins, an antioxidant compound found in blueberries that evidence shows is tied to weight loss.</p><h2>Green tea latte</h2><p>The grassy brew is rich in catechins, antioxidant-rich compounds that research suggests can boost calorie-burning. Still, store-bought tea lattes tend to be loaded with calories and sugar. Make your own better-for-you version by blending half a cup of brewed green tea with a cup of warm low-fat milk. (Blending gives the latte a rich, frothy texture.) Stir in a teaspoon of honey if you want a hint of sweetness, Shapiro says.</p><h2>Peanut butter toast</h2><p>Whole grains are filled with fiber, and peanut butter is a great source of protein and healthy fats. Combine the two for a decadently sweet treat that will satisfy your hunger and give you a boost of energy. Jessica Zinn, M.S., R.D., C.D.N., C.D.C.E.S., registered dietitian at Nutrition Energy recommends thinly sliced Dave’s Killer Bread with a serving of natural peanut butter spread on top.</p><h2>Protein bars</h2><p>Research shows that eating protein will help you feel full, and it can even curb late-night snack cravings. A low-carb protein bar is the perfect on-the-go snack option for a punch of protein without too much sugar. “Whole food protein bars like Zing Bars are great for a post-workout gym session because they provide your body with 10 g of plant based protein to support muscle recovery,” Davis says. “They are also filled with low glycemic carbs for stable blood sugar and energy.”</p><figure><img title="Protein bars" src="IMG/AA1hOmdt_protein_bars.jpg" alt="Protein bars"><figcaption><em>Protein bars.

Kirkpatrick recommends roasting some walnuts in the oven for a load of health benefits and a delicious treat. Eating a handful of walnuts a day was found to lower cholesterol and blood pressure. Plus, a serving of walnuts has about 15 g of protein, is low in carbs, and is high in healthy fats. Check out our Toasted Walnut “Pate” recipe.</p><figure><img title="Toasted walnuts" src="IMG/AA1hOoPe_toasted_walnuts.jpg" alt="Toasted walnuts"><figcaption><em>Toasted walnuts. cheche22 - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Turkey Sticks</h2><p>“Prioritizing protein with every meal and snack will leave you feeling full and satisfied,” Zinn, who recommends Turkey Jerky as a healthy snack for weight loss, says. Beyond protein bars and shakes, another great protein source for a healthy, low-calorie snack are turkey sticks. One healthier alternative from the greasy Slim Jims you may be thinking of are these New Primal Cilantro Lime Turkey Sticks, which are made from free-range turkey and are naturally sweetened. They’re individually wrapped, so you can throw them in your bag for a post-gym snack or mid-day bite at work. </p><h2>Date energy bars</h2><p>Dates are sweet fruits that you can eat on their own as a healthy snack, but you can also spruce them up a bit by trying a nutritional bar made of dates. “Date-based energy bars like Lara Bars are made with 5 simple ingredients or less,” Davis says. “The dates provide a perfect boost of pre-workout carbs to optimize energy during your training sessions.” You can even make some yourself with our Gooey Date Bars recipe. </p><h2>Cheese and crackers</h2><p>Create a low-effort charcuterie board (without the wine) with a plate of cheese and crackers. Davis recommends opting for low-fat string cheese for 7 to 8 g of protein. “When you pair it with high-fiber crackers, you have a perfect snack to keep you full and satisfied in between meals,” she says. Plus, the calcium in cheese supports bone density. </p><figure><img title="Cheese and crackers" src="IMG/AA1hOgj6_cheese_and_crackers.jpg" alt="Cheese and crackers"><figcaption><em>Cheese and crackers. MSPhotographic - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Iced coffee protein shake</h2><p>Fans of milkshakes and iced coffees—this one’s for you. Kirkpatrick recommends using an Atkins Creamy Vanilla Shake as a low-carb, low-sugar coffee creamer with a punch of protein. Choose any protein shake or milk (even protein chocolate milk can work!) to add to an iced coffee for a sweet beverage that won’t load your body with added sugars and fats, unlike a sugary latte from a coffee shop.</p><h2>Popcorn</h2><p>“Popcorn is actually a whole grain snack that provides low calories for a high volume of food,” Davis says. Before you run to the movies and grab a large bucket of popcorn, that’s not exactly the type of popcorn dietitians are referring to. Davis recommends the Lesser Evil Himalayan Salt Popcorn that is made with three simple ingredients: organic Non-GMO popcorn, organic extra virgin olive oil, and himalayan salt. You can also make your own healthy popcorn with a bit of olive oil in a pot, popcorn kernels, and a sprinkle of salt. </p><h2>Bean snacks</h2><p>Davis recommends the Bada Bean Bada Boom Roasted Broad Beans as a healthy snack for weight loss. “These beans offer 6 to 7 g of plant-based protein and 3 to 6 g of dietary fiber per 100 to 110 calorie portion making it a perfect, portable weight-loss-friendly snack,” Davis says. This snack is crunchy, comes in a variety of flavors and seasonings, and is gluten-free. </p><h2>Tortilla-protein nachos</h2><p>Nachos don’t have to be an unhealthy (but delicious) midnight snack. A healthier version with good-for-you ingredients can include tortilla-style protein chips with guacamole, which is rich in healthy fats and suitable for a Keto weight loss diet. Kirkpatrick recommends the Quest Nacho Cheese Protein Chips because they “offer a satisfying and savory protein-packed crunch, with only 4 g net carbs.”</p></main>
