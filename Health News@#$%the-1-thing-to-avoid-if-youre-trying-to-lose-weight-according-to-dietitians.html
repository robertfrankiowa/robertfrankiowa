According to dietitians, there is one crucial factor that people often overlook–and it has nothing to do with how many calories you consume.</p><p>Dietary choices are undoubtedly important, but there’s more to losing weight than what goes on your plate. Here’s what two registered dietitians said is a common roadblock to weight loss–and how to prioritize it to reach your goals.</p><h2>The 1 Thing To Avoid If You’re Trying To Lose Weight</h2><p>Skimping on sleep. When it comes to weight loss, all the focus is on diet and exercise, but it’s worth it to add good sleep to that list. </p><p>Sleep recharges your mental and physical batteries. It also plays a key role in helping you regulate your weight. In fact, sleep deprivation affects your eating habits in some pretty remarkable ways. “Even a single night of inadequate sleep has a negative impact on what you eat,” says Melissa Azzaro, RDN, owner of the nutrition consulting practice The Hormone Dietitian. </p><p>Why? Inadequate sleep affects your eating habits. You may be more likely to crave and consume carbohydrates and sugar, she explains. In addition, “we need sleep for energy. If you're feeling fatigued, you'll be less likely to meet your workout goals and/or work out at an intensity necessary for weight loss,” she says.</p><p>The connection between how you sleep and what you eat is easy to miss, too. You may naturally choose different foods when sleep deprived, but these choices often feel automatic. Research shows that disturbed sleep may make people more prone to eating more calories, primarily snacking on foods high in carbs and fat. On the other hand, getting enough sleep can make it easier to lose weight. </p><p>Changes in hormones due to sleep deprivation can make it difficult to stick to your planned eating routine. “When you get less than 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night, it affects a number of hormones in the body that regulate appetite,” says Lainey Younkin, M.S., RD, a dietitian specializing in weight loss at Lainey Younkin Nutrition. “For example, the day after an evening of poor sleep, the body releases more ghrelin–the hormone that tells you you're hungry–and decreases leptin–the hormone that tells you you're full,” she explains. Research shows that higher ghrelin and lower levels of leptin can increase calorie intake, which is linked to weight gain. Sleeping less than 5 or 6 hours per night is linked to a higher risk of developing obesity.</p><h2>Habits That Promote Healthy Sleep</h2><p>Aim to get at least 7 hours of sleep per night, which is the recommended amount for adults. That can be tough to come by in our busy lives, but the following tips may help you snag more restful shut-eye:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain a consistent sleep schedule</strong>: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.</li><li><strong>Create a relaxing bedtime routine</strong>: Engage in calming activities such as reading, taking a warm bath or practicing gentle yoga.</li><li><strong>Limit exposure to screens before bedtime</strong>: Reduce or eliminate the use of smartphones, tablets and computers at least an hour before bed.</li><li><strong>Mind your diet</strong>: Avoid heavy meals, caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime to promote better sleep quality.</li><li><strong>Ensure a comfortable sleep environment</strong>: Keep your bedroom cool, dark and quiet. Make sure you’re sleeping on a comfortable mattress and pillows.</li><li><strong>Manage stress and anxiety</strong>: Practice mindfulness, meditation or deep breathing exercises to ease your mind before sleep.</li><li><strong>Get regular physical activity</strong>: Engage in regular exercise, but avoid vigorous activity close to bedtime.</li><li><strong>Limit naps</strong>: Try to keep naps short and avoid napping late in the day to maintain your sleep routine.</li></ul><h2>Tips To Support Weight Loss</h2><p>While sleep is an important factor on a weight loss journey, it isn’t the only factor to consider. “For weight loss, we need nutrition, exercise, sleep and stress management–they're all connected,” said Azzaro. Along with prioritizing healthy sleep hygiene habits, here are some other factors to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Eat balanced meals</strong>: Focus on consuming a mix of lean proteins, healthy fats and plenty of fruits and vegetables. These Weight-Loss Meal Plans can help you get started.</li><li><strong>Exercise regularly</strong>: Incorporate both cardio and strength training exercise into your routine for overall fitness.</li><li><strong>Include fiber-rich foods</strong>: Incorporating foods high in fiber, such as whole grains, legumes and fruits and vegetables can help you feel full longer and reduce overall calorie intake.</li><li><strong>Practice mindful eating</strong>: Be as present as possible when you eat by removing distractions and setting aside time for meals. This can help with portion control and reduce overeating.</li><li><strong>Reduce alcohol consumption</strong>: Alcoholic beverages can be high in calories and may lower your inhibitions about overeating. Try to limit your intake of alcohol.</li></ul><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The #1 thing to avoid when trying to lose weight is getting inadequate sleep. Quality sleep may support metabolism regulation, reduce cravings and improve overall well-being, making it a vital component of a weight loss strategy. While sleep is undeniably an important factor in weight loss, it’s obviously not the only one. Focus on eating a balanced diet, getting regular physical activity and managing stress levels.</p><p><p>EatingWell.com, July 2024</p><p><p>EatingWell.com, July 2024</p></main>
