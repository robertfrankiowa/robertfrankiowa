    <main><h1>'Major sign' you're doing more harm than good when working out that's often overlooked</h1><p><strong>Regular exercise is vital for a healthy</strong> <strong>life, but you could actually be doing more harm than good when working out. </strong></p><p>It’s important not to push yourself too hard as this can result in serious injury, and one major sign of overexertion is often overlooked.</p><h2>‘Major sign’ you’re doing more harm than good</h2><p>If you are experiencing back pain during or after working out, that’s not normal! It’s easy to put it down to working extra hard, but it’s actually a “major sign that you are overdoing it,” fitness experts at Fitness Superstore said.</p><p>While some muscle soreness is to be expected, especially if you are new to weight training or other exercises, sharp back pain that causes serious discomfort should never be ignored, overlooked or worked through.</p><p>Back pain usually means you are overexerting yourself, the Atlas Neurosurgery and Spine Center explains. This means you are pushing yourself too hard, which can strain ligaments and muscles or rupture disks.</p><p>・<strong>FITNESS TIP:</strong> Women over 30 can improve muscle and bone density with easy-to-follow workout</p><p>Heavy exercise causes tiny tears into muscle tissue called microtraumas that trigger a healing response and add muscle mass. This is how muscle is formed, but overexercising can aggravating existing microtears and create more, leading to pain.</p><p>“Pushing through this pain can lead to excess strain on muscles and joints which may cause injuries. This can in turn set your strength training journey back, as you will have to take a longer rest period to recuperate from more extensive injuries,” the fitness experts said.</p><h2>1. Protect your form</h2><p>Poor form puts extra strain on your muscles, so it’s important to take the time to do exercises correctly to protect your back and reduce the risk of injury. The form you need will change depending on the exercise, so you must understand the requirements for each type.</p><p>Watching videos can help, or schedule a session with a personal trainer who will show you the correct stance. Generally, your feet should always be shoulder-width apart or slightly wider for stability and your back should be straight.</p><h2>2. Strengthen your core</h2><p>One of the main reasons for back pain is a weak core, as it can leave you prone to poor posture. Strengthening your core can improve flexibility and balance, which are beneficial for perfecting your form.</p><p>To strengthen your core, make sure it is fully engaged throughout your session. This is especially important for core-focussed exercises, such as planks, squats, barbell rows, yoga, Pilates and swimming.</p><h2>3. Go lighter</h2><p>It’s often tempting to lift the heaviest weights you can, but this can add strain to your muscles and joints and increase your risk of injury. So, it’s better to opt for something lighter to begin with.</p><p>Start by choosing a weight that you can comfortably lift for up to 15 reps. Then, you can gradually increase this over time.</p><h2>4. Bring a friend</h2><p>Even when working out in front of a mirror, it’s difficult to see if you’re using the correct form, so it’s a great idea to bring a friend.</p><p>They can boost your motivation while also keeping a close eye on your form, so can tell you if you’re at risk of injury.</p><h2>5. Don’t work through the pain</h2><p>Finally, make sure to listen to your body and pay attention to when your muscles start to feel fatigued or weak, as this is usually the best time to finish your workout.</p><p>Don’t work through the pain as this will cause injuries. Instead, opt for shorter workouts and slowly build up your strength and stamina over time.</p><p>It’s important to remember that some muscle soreness is normal after a heavy gym session. A new study has found that eating one common nut every day reduces muscle pain significantly after a workout.</p></main>
