Retirement isn’t just about kicking back and relaxing; it’s about prioritizing your well-being. Even small changes can yield significant results and potentially undo some past damage.</strong></p><h2>Stimulate Your Mind</h2><p>Keeping your brain engaged is key.

Research published in The American Journal of Cardiology suggests that individuals engaging in sexual activity less than twice a week may have a higher risk of heart disease.</p><h2>Prioritize Physical Health</h2><p>Retirement shouldn’t translate to a sedentary lifestyle.

Optimism contributes to overall well-being and increases the likelihood of a longer lifespan. Studies have shown that individuals with a positive mindset may live 11% to 15% longer and have a greater chance of reaching 85 years of age.</p><h2>Advocate for Your He­alth</h2><p>Understanding basic health facts and making informed decisions is essential for longevity. Research suggests that individuals with higher health literacy have lower mortality rates. Being proactive about your health includes regular check-ups and managing risk factors like high blood pressure or cholesterol levels.</p><figure><img title="Advocate for Your He­alth" src="IMG/AA1o5fam_advocate_for_your_health.jpg" alt="Advocate for Your He­alth"><figcaption><em>Advocate for Your He­alth.
