    <main><h1>Can Adderall Help Relieve Anxiety?</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Femi Aremu, PharmD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Femi Aremu, PharmD</strong><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often associated with mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety. A 2021 study showed that adults with ADHD were 4 times more likely to also have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) compared with people without ADHD.</p><p>Adderall (amphetamine and dexamphetamine mixed salts) is a commonly prescribed ADHD medication. It can be used in adults and children age 3 years and older.</p><p>If you have both ADHD and anxiety, you may want to know if Adderall helps with anxiety. While Adderall may make you feel less anxious due to the relief from ADHD symptoms, Adderall does not directly treat anxiety-related symptoms. In some cases, it can even make it worse.</p><p>This article will take a closer look at how Adderall might affect anxiety, the link between ADHD and mental health conditions, and what other treatments may help with anxiety and depression.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1nFUvg_bottles_of_adderall_xr_brand_medication_on_a_shelf_at_a_pharmacy.jpg" alt="Bottles of Adderall XR brand medication on a shelf at a pharmacy"><figcaption><em>Getty Images / Bloomberg / Contributor.

Anxiety may also cause other symptoms, such as restlessness, tiredness, and trouble concentrating.</p><p>ADHD medications, such as Adderall, may help with certain anxiety symptoms, including restlessness and decreased focus.</p><p>However, Adderall doesn't treat anxiety. So, you may still have other symptoms of anxiety even after taking Adderall.</p><h3>How Adderall Works</h3><p>Adderall is a stimulant medication. This means that it works by activating your central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord. Adderall and other stimulant drugs increase the amount of the chemicals norepinephrine and dopamine in your brain.</p><p>Higher norepinephrine levels in your brain help reduce impulsive behavior and improve focus. Dopamine helps with memory, movement control, and motivation to complete tasks.</p><h3>ADHD and Anxiety Disorders</h3><p>There is a strong link between ADHD and anxiety, and research suggests that some childhood symptoms of ADHD may bring on anxiety symptoms later in life. This is because living with unregulated ADHD symptoms can be stressful and, in turn, bring on anxious feelings.</p><p>Adderall helps to relieve symptoms of ADHD, such as restlessness or impulsive behavior. As these symptoms improve, you may feel less social anxiety and worry less about your ability to concentrate on essential tasks.</p><p>However, Adderall may also worsen anxiety.</p><p><h3>Which ADHD Medication Is Best for Anxiety?</h3><p>While Adderall and other stimulant medications may not be the best option for people with ADHD and anxiety, other non-stimulant drugs may help with ADHD symptoms without worsening anxiety.</p><p>Examples of nonstimulant medications used to treat ADHD include:</p><ul><li>Strattera (atomoxetine)</li><li>Intuniv (guanfacine)</li><li>Qelbree (viloxazine)</li></ul><p>Although non-stimulants are not considered a first choice for ADHD treatment, studies have shown that Strattera can effectively improve symptoms of both ADHD and anxiety.</p><p> <h2>If Adderall Does Not Help Anxiety, Can It Make It Worse?</h2><p>It is possible that Adderall may make anxiety worse. This is because stimulant medications, such as Adderall, may have side effects that resemble symptoms of anxiety.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li>Nervousness</li><li>Trouble sleeping</li><li>Headache</li><li>Restlessness</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Increased heart rate</li></ul><p>If you already have these symptoms, taking Adderall may worsen them.</p><p><h3>Why You Shouldn't Stop Taking Adderall Suddenly</h3><p>If you notice your anxiety symptoms worsening while on Adderall, do not stop taking your medication without first speaking to a healthcare professional.</p><p>Adderall is a stimulant that may cause physical dependence if taken long term. With physical dependence, your body needs to have a certain medication or substance to function as usual. If you develop physical dependence on a drug, you may have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking the drug suddenly.</p><p>Stopping Adderall suddenly after you've been taking the medication for a while may cause withdrawal symptoms. These can include:</p><ul><li>Depression or depressed mood</li><li>Fatigue (extreme tiredness)</li><li>Unpleasant dreams</li><li>Sleeping too little or too much</li><li>Increased appetite</li><li>Sluggishness</li><li>Agitation</li></ul><p>Due to this risk, you shouldn't stop taking Adderall suddenly.</p><p>If you and your healthcare provider decide to stop your Adderall treatment, they'll likely decrease your dosage gradually before you completely stop taking the medication. Doing so can reduce your risk of having withdrawal symptoms after stopping Adderall.</p><p> <h2>ADHD and Depression</h2><p>As with anxiety, depression has also been associated with ADHD. Studies have shown that adults with ADHD are more likely to have depression compared with those without ADHD.</p><p>Teens with ADHD are also more likely to have depression than teens without ADHD.</p><p>Additionally, the risk for developing depression is about 6 times higher during the first year of ADHD diagnosis.</p><h2>Off-Label Use of Adderall for Depression</h2><p>For some people, currently approved depression medications may not work well enough to treat their condition. Healthcare providers sometimes refer to this type of depression as treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression.</p><p>If two or more different depression medications do not work well enough to relieve depression symptoms or keep them from coming back, healthcare providers may try off-label treatments.</p><p>Using medications off-label means prescribing a medication to treat a condition or at a dose different from what the drug was approved to treat.</p><p>Stimulant medications, including Adderall, have been used off-label to treat depression that does not improve with antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>When Adderall and other stimulants are prescribed for depression, they are typically used along with an approved antidepressant.</p><h3>Adderall Precautions</h3><p>It's important to keep in mind that Adderall can interact with certain antidepressants.</p><p>For example, you should not take Adderall along with or within 14 days of stopping an antidepressant called monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Doing so may lead to dangerously high blood pressure that may result in stroke, heart attack, or even death.</p><p>Examples of MAOIs include:</p><ul><li>Nardil (phenelzine)</li><li>Parnate (tranylcypromine)</li><li>Marplan (isocarboxazid)</li></ul><p>In addition, Adderall should be used cautiously with SSRIs and SNRIs. This is because Adderall, SSRIs, and SNRIs can increase serotonin levels in your body. Taking more than one drug that increases serotonin may cause serotonin to build up in your body. Having very high serotonin levels can lead to a condition called serotonin syndrome.</p><p>With serotonin syndrome, you may have symptoms such as:</p><ul><li>Anxiety or restlessness</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Tremor or shivering</li><li>High blood pressure (hypertension) and rapid heartbeat</li><li>Fever</li><li>Nausea or vomiting</li><li>Problems with coordination</li></ul><p>Serotonin syndrome can be fatal if left untreated. Be sure to seek emergency medical attention immediately if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome while taking Adderall.</p><p><h3>Help Is Available</h3><h2>Treatments for Anxiety Disorders and Depression</h2><p>Treatments for anxiety and depression typically involve using a combination of methods. These can include psychotherapy (talk therapy), medication, or both.</p><h3>Psychotherapy</h3><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy commonly used to treat both anxiety and depression.</p><p>With CBT, you learn to change the way you think, behave, and react to situations in a way that helps improve your depression and anxiety.</p><p>Sometimes, psychotherapy alone is not enough to treat anxiety and depression. In this case, healthcare providers may prescribe medication along with psychotherapy as part of your treatment.</p><p>Medications typically prescribed to treat anxiety include:</p><ul><li>Buspirone</li><li>Benzodiazepines, such as Xanax (alprazolam) and Ativan (lorazepam)</li><li>Certain antidepressants, such as Zoloft (sertraline) and Lexapro (escitalopram)</li></ul><p>Medications commonly used to treat depression include:</p><ul><li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Zoloft and Lexapro</li><li>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Effexor XR (venlafaxine)</li><li>Wellbutrin (bupropion)</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Studies have shown that people living with ADHD are more likely to also have depression or an anxiety disorder vs. people who don't have ADHD.</p><p>Adderall is a stimulant medication commonly prescribed to treat ADHD in adults and some children. It works by increasing norepinephrine and dopamine in your brain.</p><p>Although Adderall may indirectly alleviate some anxiety symptoms, some side effects of the medication may actually make anxiety worse.</p><p>In some cases, Adderall can be prescribed off-label to treat depression. However, it is not the first-choice therapy for this condition.</p><p>If you have ADHD with another mental health condition, your healthcare provider can tell you more about the best treatment option for your condition.</p>
