    <main><h1>We Asked A Dietitian To Find Some Healthy Menu Items At McDonald's</h1><h2>Best Snack: Apple Slices</h2><p>Full of crunch and natural sweetness, apple slices are probably the cleanest order you can put in at Mickey D's. </p><p>“These apple slices are a perfect snack," says Taub-Dix. "They're a no-brainer choice for kids or adults.”</p><p><em>Per serving: 15 calories, 0 g fat (0 g sat fat), 0 mg sodium, 4 g carbs, 0 g fiber, 3 g sugar (0 g added sugars), 0 g protein</em></p><figure><img title="Best Snack: Apple Slices" src="IMG/BB1hvkBy_best_snack_apple_slices.jpg" alt="Best Snack: Apple Slices"><figcaption><em>Best Snack: Apple Slices. McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Best Hearty Breakfast: Fruit & Maple Oatmeal</h2><p>Looking for a healthy fast-food breakfast? Though this satisfying bowl has 31 grams of sugar, you can take that number down by asking for the brown sugar on the side. </p><p>“I’m a big oatmeal fan, and this dish is a quick way to fill up on whole grains rich in soluble fiber," says Taub-Dix. (That's the type of fiber that can help reduce cholesterol levels.) </p><p><em>Per serving: 320 calories, 4.5 g fat (1.5 g sat fat), 150 mg sodium, 64 g carbs, 4 g fiber, 31 g sugar (18 g added sugars), 6 g protein</em></p><figure><img title="Best Hearty Breakfast: Fruit & Maple Oatmeal" src="IMG/BB1hvAUD_best_hearty_breakfast_fruit_maple_oatmeal.jpg" alt="Best Hearty Breakfast: Fruit & Maple Oatmeal"><figcaption><em>Best Hearty Breakfast: Fruit & Maple Oatmeal. McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Best Burger: Plain Hamburger</h2><p>While a classic McDonald’s hamburger doesn't exactly contain the highest-quality meat, there <em>is</em> something to be said about its modest portion size. “The plain burger is only 250 calories,” says Taub-Dix. “Plus, in comparison to other menu items, the sodium here is relatively reasonable." </p><p>Ask for extra lettuce and tomato to boost the amount of produce piled onto your burger.</p><p><em>Per serving: 250 calories, 9 g fat (3.5 g sat fat), 510 mg sodium, 31 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 6 g sugar (5 g added sugars), 12 g protein</em></p><figure><img title="Best Burger: Plain Hamburger" src="IMG/BB1hvmTg_best_burger_plain_hamburger.jpg" alt="Best Burger: Plain Hamburger"><figcaption><em>Best Burger: Plain Hamburger. McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Best Drink: Unsweetened Iced Tea</h2><p>If you're looking for something a li'l more flavorful than plain old water, just know that a small cup of this refreshing sipper has zero calories or sugars—whereas a small fountain soda can have upwards of 39 g added sugars.</p><p><em>Per serving: 0 calories, 0 g fat (0 g sat fat), 10 mg sodium, 0 g carbs, 0 g fiber, 0 g sugar (0 g added sugars), 1 g protein</em></p><h2>Best Breakfast Sandwich: Egg McMuffin</h2><p>When you're craving a breakfast sandwich, McD's classic Egg McMuffin isn't a terrible pick. One major plus: It offers a satisfying 17 grams of protein. If you want to cut down the sodium a bit, Taub-Dix recommends skipping the Canadian bacon.</p><p><em>Per serving (including Canadian bacon): 310 calories, 13 g fat (6 g sat fat), 770 mg sodium, 30 g carbs, 2 g fiber, 3 g sugar (1 g added sugars), 17 g protein</em></p><h2>Best McCafe Item: Premium Roast Coffee</h2><p>"Even if you sprinkle a packet of sugar into a McD's Premium Roast Coffee, you wouldn’t get as many calories from sugar or fat as you would from some of their other choices," says Taub-Dix. </p><p>Plus, a McD's coffee will probably cost you less than your usual Starbucks order...just sayin'. </p><p><em>Per serving: 5 calories, 0 g fat (0 g sat fat), 20 mg sodium, 1 g carbs, 0 g fiber, 0 g sugar (0 g added sugars), 0 g protein</em></p><figure><img title="Best McCafe Item: Premium Roast Coffee" src="IMG/BB1hvkBP_best_mccafe_item_premium_roast_coffee.jpg" alt="Best McCafe Item: Premium Roast Coffee"><figcaption><em>Best McCafe Item: Premium Roast Coffee. McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Best Sandwich: Filet-O-Fish</h2><p>“As a country, we don't eat as much fish as we should—at least twice a week!—so this could help you meet your seafood quota," says Taub-Dix. In addition to being a good source of protein, fish also provides heart- and brain-boosting omega-3s. </p><p>Though the breading and higher fat content aren't ideal, the Filet-O-Fish is still an okay every-once-in-a-while order. </p><p><em>Per serving: 390 calories, 19 g fat (4 g sat fat), 580 mg sodium, 39 g carbs, 2 g fiber, 5 g sugar (4 g added sugars), 16 g protein</em></p><h2>Best Happy Meal: 4-Piece Chicken McNuggets</h2><p>Ordering off the kids' menu can be a smart way to satisfy cravings without going overboard. </p><p>"The good thing about the 4-Piece Chicken Nugget Happy Meal is that it only contains four pieces," says Taub-Dix. "I like the choice of 1% milk (vs. regular milk) and apple slices, plus that the size of the fries is not super-sized."</p><p><em>Per serving: 395 calories, 17 g fat (3.5 g sat fat), 500 mg sodium, 41 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 14 g sugar (0 g added sugars), 19 g protein</em></p></main>
