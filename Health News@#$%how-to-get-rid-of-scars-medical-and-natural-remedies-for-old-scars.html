    <main><h1>How to Get Rid of Scars: Medical and Natural Remedies for Old Scars</h1><p>Reducing the appearance of scars may depend on the scar type</p><strong>Medically reviewed by Susan Bard, MD</strong><p>Scars occur when the skin has been deeply cut or otherwise injured. Scars can form from minor injuries—such as a bad scrape on the knee—or from major skin injuries—such as burn injuries. Scars are your body’s way of repairing the skin when there’s been damage beyond the top layer of skin.</p><p>Though scars are common, some are more visible than others, and many people want to get rid of their scars to improve their skin's appearance. Many scars fade over time, and though there are no treatments to make scars disappear entirely, there are medical treatments and home remedies that may help reduce their appearance, depending on the type of scar.</p><p>This article discusses the different types of scars, why they form, and treatment options to talk with a doctor about or potentially try at home.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1mt72D_person_putting_lotion_on.jpg" alt="person putting lotion on"><figcaption><em>Suwiwat Hongsombut / Getty Images.

Scars form from scar tissue to fill in the gaps caused by a skin wound. Scars are the body’s way of repairing skin that was damaged due to a variety of factors, such as:</p><ul><li>Injury</li><li>Surgery</li><li>Infection</li><li>Tissue inflammation</li></ul><p>A scar will form wherever the skin is damaged. Scars can be flat, sunken, lumpy, or colored and are unique to each person and what caused the scar. This means that no two scars ever really look the same. </p><p>Factors that affect how a scar looks include:</p><ul><li>The size of the wound and how deep it went</li><li>The cause of the wound (e.g., surgery, burn, acne)</li><li>Which part of the body the skin damage occurred</li><li>How the wound was treated</li></ul><h3>Keloid Scars</h3><p>Keloid scars are a type of raised scar (i.e., it forms above the skin) that, unlike most scars, grow to be bigger than the wound that caused the scar. A keloid can take months or even years to form and may be painful or itchy as it grows. Anything that causes a scar to form can cause a keloid scar. Some people’s skin is more prone to keloids and may get a keloid scar after:</p><ul><li>Having acne or chicken pox</li><li>Getting a body piercing (especially an ear piercing)</li><li>Sustaining a wound from a cut, puncture, burn, scrape, bug bite, surgery, or injection</li><li>Having a skin disease that causes inflammation, such as folliculitis</li><li>Getting a tattoo</li></ul><p>Research has shown that genetics play a role in the development of keloids: 33–50% of people who develop a keloid have a blood relative who gets keloids. The genes that make someone more likely to develop keloids are more common in people with darker skin tones. Keloid scars don’t go away on their own and must be treated to reduce their appearance.</p><h3>Hypertrophic Scars</h3><p>Hypertrophic scar is the medical term for a raised scar. Hypertrophic scars form above the skin, creating a raised, firm scar that may take months or years to flatten. Hypertrophic scars can form anywhere on the body but are more likely to show up on the upper back, chest, or shoulders. Hypertrophic scars are different from keloids in that they are limited to the injury site, whereas keloids can grow larger, beyond the wound.</p><h3>Atrophic Scars</h3><p>Atrophic scars are depressed scars, meaning they form under the skin's surface, giving the skin a sunken or pitted appearance. Atrophic scars mostly form on the face and are more likely to happen after severe acne and chicken pox clear up. Atrophic scars, such as acne scars, may become more noticeable with age as the skin relaxes, making depressions in the skin more apparent.</p><h3>Contracture Scars</h3><p>Contracture scars form when a large skin area is damaged or lost, such as a burn scar that develops after a severe burn injury. A contracture scar can also develop from a large keloid.</p><p>When contracture scars form, the edges of the skin are pulled together, which makes the skin tight in that area and may even make it harder to move the affected body part. For example, a contracture scar over a joint, such as a knee, can make it difficult or even impossible to bend or straighten the joint.</p><h3>Fine-Line Scars</h3><p>Fine-line scars are “normal” scars that form after a cut or minor incision, such as surgery scars. Fine-line scars usually appear as a red, raised line and will flatten and fade over time, though they don’t disappear completely. The scar may become brown or white on darker skin tones, and on lighter skin tones, the scar will get paler. Fine-line scars aren’t painful, but they may be itchy.</p><h3>Widespread Scars</h3><p>Widespread scars occur when fine-line scars, such as those after surgery, stretch and widen. They are flat, pale, painless, and common after knee or shoulder surgery. Stretch marks (striae) are a variant of widespread scars in which the connective tissue beneath the skin breaks. Stretch marks are common when the skin rapidly shrinks or grows, such as during pregnancy or weight gain or loss.</p><h2>Medical Remedies for Getting Rid of Scars</h2><p>Even though scars usually fade over time, they don’t completely disappear. Certain dermatological treatments can help minimize the appearance of scars. Which medical remedies a healthcare provider or dermatologist recommends will depend on a variety of factors, including your age, medical history, and health status as well as the type, location, and severity of the scar. Talk to a healthcare provider or dermatologist to see which of the following medical remedies might be right for you and your scar.</p><h3>Silicone Gels or Sheets</h3><p>Silicone can minimize the appearance of a raised scar by reducing the swelling, redness, size, and hardness of the scar. Silicone can also prevent a raised scar from forming. Silicone gel sheets are thin and adhesive and are worn over the scar usually every day, sometimes for months.</p><h3>Steroids</h3><p>Steroids are a treatment option for keloids. Steroids are injected into the scar tissue to reduce the size and hardness of the scar. Steroids may also reduce uncomfortable symptoms of the scar, such as itchiness and burning sensations.</p><h3>Laser Therapy</h3><p>Laser therapy is often a go-to treatment option for all types of scars, including raised scars, depressed scars from acne scars, and keloids. Laser therapy can reduce the appearance of scars as well as the pain, itchiness, or limited range of motion associated with the scar. It’s important to keep in mind that laser treatment is a more involved medical procedure, and there are a handful of rules to follow (such as avoiding the sun) before you can get treatment.</p><h3>Dermal Fillers</h3><p>Dermal fillers (soft tissue fillers) are a type of injection that can create a smoother, fuller appearance on the face by filling in certain features—like the lips—or fine lines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves dermal fillers for limited uses, including correcting acne scars.</p><h3>Chemical Peels</h3><p>Chemical peels may treat superficial (not deep) scars. Chemical peels work by removing the top layer of skin, causing the skin to generate new skin, giving the skin a smoother appearance.</p><h3>Subcision</h3><p>Subcision is a minor surgical procedure for treating atrophic/depressed scars, such as those that result from acne or chicken pox. Subcision involves inserting a needle into the skin to break up fibers that are holding the scar to underlying tissue. This then allows the fibers to be released and promotes collagen production, improving the scar’s appearance.</p><h3>Punch Excision</h3><p>Punch excision is when a small hole is punched into the skin to remove the scar. The scar is then replaced with a skin graft, usually from the back of the earlobe. This is called a punch graft and often works to treat severe acne scars.</p><h3>Microneedling</h3><p>Microneedling is when tiny needles puncture the skin, stimulating collagen production and making scars less noticeable. Microneedling may help treat acne scars, stretch marks, and scars from surgery or injury. Microneedling is also called collagen induction therapy.</p><h3>Medicated Creams</h3><p>Medicated creams may also reduce the appearance of scars. Creams are applied topically, on the scar and will differ according to how frequently and for how long they are applied. Be sure to follow a healthcare provider or dermatologist’s instructions for applying medicated creams and tell them if any side effects occur.</p><h3>OTC Creams</h3><p>In addition to medicated creams, there are scar creams and gel sheets you can get over the counter (OTC) to help reduce the appearance of scars. OTC scar creams each have their pros and cons, and you may have to try multiple times to find the one that works best for you. Talk to a healthcare professional if you notice any concerning side effects or don’t find any OTC creams that work for you.</p><h2>Natural Remedies for Getting Rid of Scars</h2><p>Depending on the scar and its severity, you may be able to reduce the appearance of scars with natural remedies you can use at home. However, some of these remedies may be more appropriate for wound healing rather than improving the appearance of existing scars.</p><p>If you have an old scar that is bothering you, the following natural remedies may be worth a try. Still, it’s best to always seek the advice of a healthcare provider before starting home treatments because many home remedies for scars lack scientific evidence.</p><h3>Aloe Vera</h3><p>Aloe vera is a medicinal plant that promotes wound healing of various sorts, including burns and surgical wounds. Aloe vera is usually found as a gel or ointment. Though aloe vera has proven benefits for wound healing, it may work best with other treatments.</p><h3>Honey</h3><p>Honey has been used for centuries as a traditional medicine for wound healing. Honey’s viscosity allows for a protective barrier to prevent wound infections, and its low pH is thought to create an optimal environment for skin healing components, including collagen production.</p><h3>Coconut Oil</h3><p>Coconut oil is moisturizing and has lauric acid, which has antimicrobial properties, but there's no scientific evidence to say it will remove scars.</p><h3>Apple Cider Vinegar</h3><p>Apple cider vinegar has been touted as a catch-all remedy in recent years, but no scientific evidence supports its effect on scars. Lactic acid, an ingredient in apple cider vinegar, is a common ingredient in chemical peels, which, as noted above, may treat superficial scars. Still, its concentration in apple cider vinegar won’t produce the same results as a chemical peel.</p><h3>Lavender and Olive Oil</h3><p>Research suggests that lavender oil promotes wound healing by speeding up wound closure, though this was limited to an animal model. Olive oil adds a moisturizing component to skin products and has been shown to have vitamins and minerals beneficial to the skin, but olive oil is not a proven treatment for scars.</p><h3>Lemon</h3><p>Lemon juice may be beneficial for the skin thanks to its high vitamin C content, which can fight free radicals and help build collagen. However, it doesn't seem to heal scars or cause them to fade.</p><h3>Potatoes</h3><p>Claims about rubbing potatoes or potato juice on your face to treat skin blemishes such as dark spots from acne scars are not supported by scientific evidence.</p><h3>Rosehip and Frankincense</h3><p>As popular essential oils, rosehip and frankincense are associated with many skin care claims, yet scientific evidence of their effectiveness on scar removal is lacking. One 2015 study showed that rosehip seed oil reduced the appearance of post-surgical scars after six and 12 weeks of use, though the study was small, and more research is necessary to determine its effectiveness.</p><p>Mixing baking soda with water is yet another popular home remedy for a variety of skin problems, such as eczema. Baking soda has antibacterial properties, but that won’t help scar removal. More scientific evidence is necessary to support the use of baking soda for reducing the appearance of scars.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Scars are a normal part of the wound healing process. Scars are your body’s way of repairing damage beyond the top layer of skin, such as from a surgical incision, burn injury, or deep cut. There are several types of scars, and treatment may vary depending on the type.</p><p>Medical remedies are your best bet for reducing the appearance of scars. If you’re looking for natural remedies, it’s best to talk with a healthcare provider for their recommendations for ones to try and ones to skip.</p></main>
