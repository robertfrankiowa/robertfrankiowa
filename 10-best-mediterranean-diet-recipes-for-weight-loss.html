    <main><h1>10 Best Mediterranean Diet Recipes for Weight Loss</h1><p>If you're curious about where to start when working toward your goal weight, consider checking out the Mediterranean Diet, this year's #1 weight loss plan. Not only is the MedDiet an exceptional healthy lifestyle choice because of its emphasis on fresh fish, veggies, whole grains, fruits, and nuts, but there are also so many amazing dishes you can seamlessly prepare. It's easy to get bored with many diets within the first few weeks of following them, but the possibilities of this particular way of eating are truly endless. We have the 10 best Mediterranean Diet recipes for weight loss, so there's no better place to start your diet than right here.</p><p>How is the MedDiet beneficial for weight loss? <strong>Laura Burak MS, RD</strong>, founder of GetNaked® Nutrition and author of <em>Slim Down with Smoothies</em> tells <em>Eat This, Not That!</em>, "Consider the qualities of a Mediterranean diet and the foods and lifestyle that exist in Mediterranean regions of the world where obesity and heart disease is the least prevalent. There is an abundance of plant foods or foods that naturally grow outside or are found in nature like whole grains, beans, lentils, fruits and veggies, avocados, olives, nuts, seeds, and fish. These foods as a whole are naturally full of fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and heart-healthy omega-3 fats which help to stabilize blood sugar and keep you full, satisfied, and well nourished with very little added sugar."</p><p>A diet that's chock-full of veggies, heart-healthy fats, and lean proteins in just the right amounts is really "<em>THE</em> recipe" for keeping up a healthy weight, Burak adds. That's because it offers protein that will keep hunger cravings at bay, along with volume and fat from produce, so you're basically "eating more but taking in less." Burak says this is essential if you're looking to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>When following the MedDiet for weight loss, there are certain food staples you should include on your weekly shopping list. They include:</p><p><ul><p>  <li>Fruits and veggies (basically anything that grows in a garden that contains natural anti-inflammatory properties and nutrients)</li><p>  <li>Olive oil, which Burak says is "the staple of the Mediterranean diet"</li><p>  <li>Nuts and seeds, which offer all three macros—fat, protein, and carbs</li><p>  <li>Canned fish, or "hunger-stabilizing proteins," such as tuna, sardines, and salmon</li></ul><p>Now, let's get into the 10 best Mediterranean Diet recipes for weight loss you'll want to add to your rotation ASAP.
