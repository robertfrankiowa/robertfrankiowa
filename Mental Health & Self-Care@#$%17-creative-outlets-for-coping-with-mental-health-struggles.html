    <main><h1>17 Creative Outlets for Coping With Mental Health Struggles</h1><p>When we struggle with our mental health, there are many steps we can take. Experts often recommend indulging in our existing talents or taking the opportunity to try something new.</p><p>Creative work can be soothing and help lift our mood. It also provides a good distraction from whatever is troubling us. If you already possess a talent, you’ll know which path to take, but if not, here are some ideas.</p><h2>1. Painting</h2><p>Painting is where many creative people start. When we think of creative subjects, painting is often the first option that comes to mind. Taking classes to improve your skills is easy, but you don’t have to return to school.</p><p>Buy a canvas, some paints, and brushes, and dive right in. Natural talent helps, but less skilled might even consider a paint-by-number set. It’s an excellent activity for mental health, and no one should feel excluded.</p><h2>2. Writing</h2><p>Creative writing can take many different forms. Try some poetry, or if you have storytelling ambitions, try your hand at fiction. Others like reporting on current events. Writing can offer a welcome boost if you take a break due to mental health concerns.</p><p>Another good idea is to start a journal. Write down your thoughts and feelings to record your progress through this journey.</p><figure><img title="2. Writing" src="IMG/BB1kbaYR_2_writing.jpg" alt="2. Writing"><figcaption><em>2. Writing.

A popular choice involves “real-world” scenarios, so perhaps you’d like to build a model railway village.</p><p>My passion project is to build a model soccer stadium. You can buy pitches, teams, and stands online and design them any way you want. Some would argue it’s not creative if the items are pre-constructed, but I don’t see it this way. Your imagination takes over as you make the stadium according to your vision.</p><h2>4. Singing</h2><p>Singing might be another creative for you. The premiere of TV shows depicting ordinary people joining choirs has led to a rise in singing as a hobby. Start by belting out some tunes in the shower, and see if you’d like to do this in front of others. Millions of popular songs are online, so pick a few karaoke tracks and see what works for you.</p><p>If you’re ready for the next step, a greater interest in singing may spur you to join a local choir or spend the occasional night at a karaoke bar.</p><h2>5. Playing an Instrument</h2><p>Many of us don’t have the voice of an angel and would never dare to sing. If you’d run a mile from a choir but are interested in music, why not learn to play an instrument? Local college courses are available, or you could hire a tutor to come to your home. Many music stores also offer lessons from professionals.</p><p>Consider starting a band or joining a local orchestra if you’re already a skilled musician.</p><h2>6. Knitting</h2><p>Knitting is a dying art, but it’s time to revive it. Like other hobbies on this list, it has the qualities needed to offer a boost when you’re mentally drained. Knitting is therapeutic, and seeing the finished product can provide a welcome sense of satisfaction.</p><p>Hobby stores should stock everything you need to start knitting, or you can order materials online. If you’re new to the hobby, it’s easy to pick up, and all the instructions you need are available on websites or online videos.</p><figure><img title="6. Knitting" src="IMG/BB1kdS0K_6_knitting.jpg" alt="6. Knitting"><figcaption><em>6. Knitting. Provided by Kinda Frugal</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7. Drawing</h2><p>Some may think this suggestion should have appeared in the painting section, but there are differences between the two disciplines. Drawing requires fewer materials to get started. Grab a pencil and sketch pad, and you’re ready to go.</p><p>Drawing also involves less mess and is a preferred option for many creative people.</p><h2>8. Woodworking</h2><p>If you’re already a skilled woodworker and have the tools at home, this is a great time to indulge in your favorite hobby. If you’re a novice, there are classes you can take to help develop those talents.</p><p>Many of us took woodworking classes in school. There was satisfaction in working with natural materials and producing a chess board or spice rack. You can feel that sense of achievement in adulthood, too.</p><h2>9. Cooking</h2><p>Cooking is an essential activity in the home, but if you want to test your skills in the kitchen, you can take it a step further by making it creative and turning it into an art form. Move on from basic dishes and aim for a complex meal that you’ve always wanted to try.</p><p>Baking and dessert making can also produce impressive results that delight your family and friends.</p><h2>10. Photography</h2><p>If you’re the type of photographer who points and clicks, it may be time to elevate those basic skills. Many of us have an eye for a good picture but can’t figure out the various camera settings to get the best results.</p><p>Online courses are there to help, or you could take an extended break to practice trial and error. Photography is a rewarding hobby and a satisfying way to indulge your creativity.</p><h2>11. Gardening</h2><p>Many don’t see gardening as a creative outlet, but they’re wrong. The best gardeners are artists who turn a blank yard into something beautiful. If you’re already skilled in this craft, it’s perfect for its mental health benefits, but anyone can get involved.</p><p>Learning the basics of gardening will help you grow plants, flowers, and shrubs, and you can even stock up your fruit and vegetable cupboard. It’s therapeutic, and I recommend gardening as a mood lifter.</p><h2>12. Coloring</h2><p>Adult coloring books took off in a way that surprised many of us. We were sure we left that all behind in kindergarten, but sales figures were impressive for the most imaginative designs.</p><p>We shouldn’t be shocked. Coloring is a calming activity that can help us achieve a meditative state. While some skills are involved, they’re not as complex as some of the hobbies on this list, so coloring books are a good option for all creative talents.</p><h2>13. Sculpture</h2><p>Sculpture is an overlooked area in art, mainly because few people take up sculpting at school or college. Materials are relatively expensive, and mastering this craft is difficult.</p><p>If you’ve yet to try it, maybe you have a hidden talent. If not, it doesn’t matter. Working with clay is fun and another activity that can boost your mood.</p><h2>14. Dancing</h2><p>Dancing is another pastime where some will argue against the level of creativity, but don’t let that stop you. Dancing is fun. It releases endorphins, which help reduce stress and boost cognitive functions.</p><p>Local dance classes have taken off recently, so you’ll almost certainly find one in your neighborhood. You could even try interpretive dance if you want to test your creativity.</p><figure><img title="14. Dancing" src="IMG/BB1kvreR_14_dancing.jpg" alt="14. Dancing"><figcaption><em>14. Dancing.

The creative aspect helps relax the mind, but the end products can be helpful in different ways.</p><p>If you’re happy with the results, you can give jewelry to friends and family for birthdays and other occasions. A homemade bead necklace can also be used as a fidget tool to help restore calm in stressful situations.</p><h2>16. Upcycling</h2><p>Upcycling is restoring new life to products that seem destined for the garbage. Furniture is a popular medium, but upcyclers also work with pallets, tin cans, and anything that inspires creativity.</p><p>A host of TV programs, online videos, and blogs offer inspiration so anyone can get started with this fascinating and rewarding hobby.</p><h2>17. Quilt Making</h2><p>Quilting has a long history in the United States, dating back hundreds of years. It’s less popular today, but many families like to keep the tradition alive. Finding time is an issue, so why not use any break you take while looking after your mental health?</p><p>Using up scraps of material is a worthwhile process in itself. In this wasteful age, we’re all looking to recycle, and quilt-making is a great way to be creative and help the environment while you’re at it.</p><figure><img title="17.

The Gen X cohort, those born between 1965 and 1980, definitely left their mark on the culture of the time. However, like all trends, some of this era have become outdated and should be reconsidered. Here are 18 Gen X trends that might have outlived their relevance.</p><p>18 Gen X Trends Whose Time Has Past</p><h2>18 Life Lessons Many Wish They’d Learned Earlier in Life</h2><p>As Gen X journey through the ever-changing landscapes of work, relationships, and personal growth, they’ve gained insights they wish to impart to their younger selves.
