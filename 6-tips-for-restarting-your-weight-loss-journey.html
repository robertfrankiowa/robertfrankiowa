    <main><h1>6 Tips for Restarting Your Weight Loss Journey</h1><p>We make self-care goals out of a desire to live our best lives. The trouble is, these goals aren’t always easy to keep. Whether your intention was to eat healthier, exercise more, or something else, it’s only natural to feel disheartened if you’re not quite batting a thousand.</p><p>The reassuring news is that no one’s path is completely bump-free, and it’s never too late to dust yourself off and get back on track. Here, experts share six powerful ways to help you bounce back and resume your weight loss journey — with long-term success as the target.</p><h2>1. Be Kind to Yourself</h2><p>“Remember to give yourself grace. No one is perfect, and sometimes life doesn’t go as planned,” says Alyssa Smolen, a registered dietitian nutritionist based in Essex County, New Jersey. “Life is unpredictable. A death in the family, sudden illness, or even a new job could interfere with someone’s plans for weight loss. When this happens, it’s important to tell yourself that this blip is temporary,” she says, and not a reflection on you.</p><p>Indeed, recent research shows that in the face of weight loss setbacks, being kind to yourself could help you bounce back more easily. In a study consisting of 140 participants, researchers sought to understand the immediate role that self-compassion plays when it comes to preventing demoralization from dietary lapses. They discovered that those who practice self-compassion, including the ability to treat oneself with the same sensitivity and kindness that they would offer to friends, experienced a greater sense of self-control over weight management behaviors in the hours following a setback.</p><p>“Results suggest that self-compassion following dieting setbacks may prevent goal disengagement, and that self-kindness is the facet most strongly associated with adaptive responses to these setbacks,” the study’s authors write.</p><p>An example of this is to skip the self-blame and remind yourself that you’re human, says sports dietitian and fitness coach Umo Callins, RDN, founder of Well Rooted Health and Nutrition in Oklahoma City. “Changing habits is not easy, and challenges are to be expected in your weight loss journey. Try to shift your focus,” she says, by acknowledging your progress instead of dwelling on your setbacks.</p><p>You can remind yourself that you started once and can most certainly start again, says Smolen. “Don’t get discouraged; just start back where you left off.”</p><h2>2. Remember Your “Why”</h2><p>Take a moment to recall the reason(s) you were inspired to start your weight loss journey — and hold on to that, says Callins. Perhaps you wanted to boost your energy levels, feel more confident, or improve your overall health. The “why” looks different for everyone, and it’s helpful to remember yours.</p><p>Considering life’s tendency to throw curveballs at us, it’s even more important to be driven by purpose. In a study that analyzed nearly 2,000 middle-age adults, individuals who reported a stronger sense of purpose were less likely to experience negative side effects from daily stress, such as hopelessness, shame, nervousness, and worthlessness. Sense of purpose was also associated with higher likeliness of positive emotions, including feeling calm, peaceful, proud, and confident. </p><p>The takeaway: Committing to weight loss goals is no easy task, but keeping your “why” in mind can not only help you stay resolute about your end goal, but also enhance your well-being and emotional resilience. This can ultimately help you manage everyday stressors that might otherwise derail you.</p><h2>3. Shift From Self-Blame to Self-Growth</h2><p>Getting back on track can be especially difficult if you’re fending off feelings of shame. However, a simple mindset shift can work wonders, says Katie Breazeale, a Temple, Texas–based registered dietitian at Nourish. For instance, instead of berating yourself for not being perfect, try learning from the experience and identifying where there might be room for improvement, she says.</p><p>To start, consider asking yourself if your diet plan was overly rigid. “Being too restrictive with calories or food choices is difficult to sustain and can lead to binging later on. It can also lead to exhaustion, increased cravings, and a lack of key nutrients your body needs — all of which can lead to burnout,” says Breazeale.</p><p>Another question to ask is whether you disliked what you were eating. For instance, if you don’t particularly enjoy fish, attempting a Mediterranean diet is likely not the right eating plan for you, Breazeale says.</p><p>It’s crucial to not beat yourself up for any unintentional missteps — we <em>all</em> make mistakes. Simply learn from them and adjust accordingly, ensuring that your weight loss strategy is something that’s both sustainable and enjoyable.</p><h2>4. Reset With Realistic Goals</h2><p>While ambition is typically a good thing, you’ll want to be mindful of planning for the long term and not overextending yourself. “When starting up weight loss again, instead of setting a goal like eating vegetarian all week, start with something more sustainable, like three times a week,” Smolen suggests.</p><p>Breazeale says that “going all in is great in theory, but can cause fast burnout.” So rather than attempting it all — meal prepping, exercising, drinking enough water, eating more fruits and vegetables, calorie counting, and more — it’s better to strive for smaller, more realistic goals. “If you’re not used to doing all of these things, it can lead to overload — especially when you still have to manage work and a personal life,” she explains.</p><p>“The big thing when you feel discouraged is to take a step back and know that progress is not [about] perfection. Think of all the great habits you’ve already created and any milestones you’ve accomplished. Re-evaluate your goals and make sure they’re still what you want, setting new [objectives] as necessary,” says Breazeale.</p><p>As you’re thinking about what you’d like to achieve, ensure your goals are SMART goals, Callins says, meaning they’re specific, measurable, action-oriented, reasonable, and time-bound.</p><p>According to Brooklyn College, “using the SMART goal framework sets boundaries and defines the steps you’ll need to take, resources necessary to get there and milestones that indicate progress along the way. With SMART goals, you’re more likely to achieve your goal efficiently and effectively.”</p><p>As to how many goals to set for yourself, aim for two to three, says Smolen. “Creating too many goals can be overwhelming. Set fewer ones and work from there in order to better keep up.” </p><h2>5. Build a Support System</h2><p>While weight loss is a personal journey, you don’t have to do it alone — especially considering that the going does get tough. “Don’t be afraid to reach out for help when you’ve fallen off track,” says Callins. “Nothing beats a strong support system.”</p><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, it’s beneficial to “tell your family and friends that you would appreciate their help, and [to] let them know specifically how they can help you. For example, you might ask your partner to walk with you and your best friend to be there when you need to vent.”</p><p>Qualified professionals such as a registered dietitian, certified personal trainer, or other trained health coach can also be conducive to your long-term success by cheering you on and assisting with accountability and navigating barriers. “These professionals can suggest ways to approach your weight loss journey safely and effectively,” Callins says.</p><p>Finally, consider an accountability partner, says Callins. “Having someone you know and trust to motivate and encourage you during your weight loss journey can be so helpful. They may even want to join you!”</p><h2>6. Celebrate the Little Things</h2><p>When setting your sights on losing weight, it can be tempting to fixate on the numbers on the scale. However, it’s important to note that the scale is not the only marker of success, says Breazeale. Results may be less obvious, at least initially. “To reach our weight loss goals, we must [first] build sustainable habits that may not reflect on the scale immediately.”</p><p>This is where small wins shine. To keep your motivation steady, it’s valuable to track and celebrate any small milestone. What this looks like differs for everyone, but can include “inches lost, improved sleep, better digestion, and more energy,” says Breazeale, who adds that these are all signs of success.</p><p>Perhaps you’re noticing reduced anxiety, that you were able to walk further this week than the last, or you drank more water — they all count, Smolen says. Tiny but mighty victories such as these might be more noticeable than scale-related goals and are wonderful indicators that you're making steady advances toward your end goal.</p><p>Plus, these little wins can be incredibly validating when you’re playing the long game. “Small wins contribute to big victories,” says Callins. “They’re proof that the changes you’re making are working and benefiting you. They also confirm the hard work you are putting in is paying off.”</p><p>According to the University of Minnesota Extension, “the simple practice of recording your progress helps you to appreciate your small wins, which in turn boosts your sense of confidence. Any accomplishment, no matter how small, releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, which boosts your mood, motivation, and attention. It also signals you to keep doing the activity again and again.”</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>Setting a weight loss goal is an excellent step toward self-care and better health, but weight loss doesn’t come without challenges.</p><p>If you find yourself losing steam, remember that this is a natural part of the journey. “Initially, motivation is high for those seeking to lose weight, but it’s not uncommon for motivation to [eventually] ebb and flow,” Callins says. Simply treat stumbles along the way as opportunities to adjust and learn, and remember that goal setting is not about perfection. It’s important to give yourself grace and tell yourself that you can and will bounce back.</p><p>Last but not least, don’t forget to applaud yourself. The next time you notice positive changes in your life stemming from your dedicated efforts, take a moment to celebrate. This will go a long way toward building trust in yourself and the progress you’re making — all while instilling momentum-boosting joy in the process.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
