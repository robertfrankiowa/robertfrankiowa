    <main><h1>Essential Oils Can Truly Help, But Be Aware Of The Risks</h1><h2>The Truth About Essential Oils</h2><p>Some people have had severe reactions to essential oils because they are using them incorrectly and too much .</p><p>Essential oils are very powerful and should be treated as a therapy for a specific ailment under professional advisement. To give some perspective on the concentration of these oils:</p><ul>   <li>1 drop of rose essential oil is the equivalent of 30-50 roses [4].</li>   <li>1 drop of peppermint essential oil is equivalent to 28 cups of peppermint tea.</li>   <li>250 pounds of lavender are needed to make 1 pound of essential oil.</li>   <li>1,500 lemons are needed to make 1 pound of essential oil.</li>  </ul><p>While they're sold over the counter, these oils should only be used under guidance by professionals and not the people who work for companies trying to sell their essential oils although they may mean well.</p><figure><img title="The Truth About Essential Oils" src="IMG/BB1oa56R_the_truth_about_essential_oils.jpg" alt="The Truth About Essential Oils"><figcaption><em>The Truth About Essential Oils.

Just because they're natural doesn't mean they aren't powerful!</p><figure><img title="Research Backing Up Efficacy of Essential Oils" src="IMG/BB1oa2CN_research_backing_up_efficacy_of_essential_oils.jpg" alt="Research Backing Up Efficacy of Essential Oils"><figcaption><em>Research Backing Up Efficacy of Essential Oils.

It's important to read the label as well since some oils are already mixed with carrier oils.</p><p><b>There is a difference between organic and non-organic.</b> Don't assume oil is organic-the label will need to specify this. If buying organic is important to you, you may want to invest in the organic version of your essential oils.</p><p><b>Essential oils are not the same thing as synthetic fragrances.</b> Synthetic fragrances can be very toxic. However, some compounds under the term "fragrance" can, in fact, be natural and may include certain components from natural essential oils .</p><p><b>Once you become sensitive, it's hard to go back.</b> Once you become sensitive to certain essential oils from overuse, it can be hard to convince the body that it doesn't need to react to them, so you may never be able to use them again once you have a reaction.</p><p><b>Essential oils aren't great for the planet.</b> While certainly better therapies in regards to the environment as opposed to conventional medicines, essential oils generally aren't great for the environment as they require large amounts of their plants in order to produce the oil.</p><figure><img title="Important Things to Note About Essential Oils" src="IMG/BB1oa7Vw_important_things_to_note_about_essential_oils.jpg" alt="Important Things to Note About Essential Oils"><figcaption><em>Important Things to Note About Essential Oils.

She claims to have scars and hypersensitivity to personal care products due to her toxic reaction.</p><p>In addition to chemical burns from applying essential oils, further caution is needed. Oils such as citrus and lemon verbena can increase photosensitivity/phototoxicitywhen applied before exposure to sunlight causing burns. People can also experience rashes around the eyes or mouth from essential oil diffusers or even essential oil mouthwashes or lip balm.</p><p>Blisters, asthma or allergy symptoms, and contact dermatitis are all negative health effects of overusing essential oils. While natural, essential oils can still have side effects and best practices should be used. </p><figure><img title="Negative Reactions and Side Effects of Essential Oils" src="IMG/BB1oa9vB_negative_reactions_and_side_effects_of_essential_oils.jpg" alt="Negative Reactions and Side Effects of Essential Oils"><figcaption><em>Negative Reactions and Side Effects of Essential Oils.

I use lavender essential oil in the tub and have been directed by one of my herbalists to use a specific essential oil blend for my dysmenorrhea.</p><p>When used properly, they can be great tools and resources for specific health conditions. Remember these best practices when befriending essential oils:</p><ul>   <li>Most essential oils cannot be taken internally with rare exceptions and even these exceptions shouldn't be taken internally unless directed by a professional.</li>   <li>Children, teens, and women who are pregnant or nursing can be even more sensitive to essential oils and may want to avoid them.</li>   <li>Citrus essential oils can cause chemical burns when exposed to UV rays; they're photosensitive and should not be used in natural sunscreen.</li>   <li>Work with a health professional such as a certified herbalist, naturopath, or integrative health doctor who has experience using essential oils. Do not take health advice from a distributor for a company that sells essential oils: in general, they are trained to sell the product, not on how to use it for your health!</li>   <li>Never use essential oils undiluted on your skin, especially an open wound, unless directed otherwise by a healthcare professional (usually only certain essential oils are safe to use undiluted such as lavender, chamomile, and rose).</li>   <li>Never store them in plastic containers as they are so potent they can eat through plastic (you probably shouldn't be using plastic, anyway!)</li>   <li>Just because a certain essential oil might be beneficial for someone else doesn't mean it's beneficial for you. Everyone is unique and will react differently to certain substances and some people are more sensitive than others.</li>   <li>Remember, most essential oils are flammable and should be disposed of properly [14].</li>  </ul><figure><img title="Modern Use of Essential Oils and Best Practices" src="IMG/BB1oa0qc_modern_use_of_essential_oils_and_best_practices.jpg" alt="Modern Use of Essential Oils and Best Practices"><figcaption><em>Modern Use of Essential Oils and Best Practices.

And like my grandmother always said, everything in moderation!</p></main>
