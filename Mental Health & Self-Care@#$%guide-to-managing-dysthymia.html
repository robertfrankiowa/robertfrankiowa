    <main><h1>Guide To Managing Dysthymia</h1><h2>Psychotherapy</h2><p>Psychotherapy is the main recommended treatment method, and it's often used in conjunction with medication. Psychotherapy may also be used alone if the patient can't take medication or doesn't want to take medication. For this reason, it tends to be the first recommendation for adolescents and children with persistent depressive disorder, since they're at higher risk of antidepressant side effects. Psychotherapy is often called talk therapy. During a talk therapy session, an individual with dysthymia can talk to their trained therapist for thirty to sixty minutes. Sessions are usually held once per week, but can occur more often if a patient needs more support. Their therapist can help them address multiple emotional difficulties like current life stress, past trauma, day-to-day struggles, and problems with interpersonal relationships. Many individuals find having a therapist improves their outlook because they know they have someone to talk to if they need it.</p><figure><img title="Psychotherapy" src="IMG/BB1pGkuu_psychotherapy.jpg" alt="Psychotherapy"><figcaption><em>Psychotherapy.

These include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). SSRIs are the class of antidepressant most commonly prescribed. These medications increase serotonin levels but cause fewer overall side effects than many other antidepressant options. That said, if there's any chance an individual's dysthymia could be misdiagnosed bipolar disorder, they shouldn't increase their serotonin levels. TCAs increase both serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain. SNRIs block the brain from reabsorbing norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain, which helps regulate mood, though they may have more side effects than other medications. Some patients don't experience any side effects, while others struggle with a variety of side effects.</p><figure><img title="Antidepressants" src="IMG/BB1mnsYF_antidepressants.jpg" alt="Antidepressants"><figcaption><em>Antidepressants.

Not only does this help patients keep up-to-date on managing their mood and treatment, but there's new information about dysthymia being discovered every day. Researchers are establishing new treatment methods of both the medication and therapy variety. Another reason for individuals to continuously educate themselves about dysthymia is so they can be self-aware of how the disorder affects them. It's common for dysthymia to lead to feelings of low self-worth and unhappiness with one's life. Rather than believing those feelings and drowning in them, which can lead to self-destructive behavior, individuals should try to recognize and acknowledge them. The more they understand about dysthymia, the more they understand about their own brain.</p><figure><img title="Continuous Education About Dysthymia" src="IMG/BB1pGthH_continuous_education_about_dysthymia.jpg" alt="Continuous Education About Dysthymia"><figcaption><em>Continuous Education About Dysthymia.

An individual might have a thriving home life, a great job, and a variety of hobbies, and still feel depressed. But external triggers can cause dysthymia symptoms to become much worse. With dysthymia, it's common for a brain to fixate more heavily on negative things than positive ones. Different individuals are triggered by different things, so they need to pay attention. Stress of any kind can make symptoms worse. Confrontations and harsh critiques can have an impact on self-esteem, while long periods without social activity can contribute to depression. Once individuals know what triggers them, they can acknowledge their triggers and deal with them in a healthy way.</p><figure><img title="Pay Attention To Triggers" src="IMG/AA1nLDEY_pay_attention_to_triggers.jpg" alt="Pay Attention To Triggers"><figcaption><em>Pay Attention To Triggers.  MSN </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Get Regular Physical Exercise</h2><p>If possible, individuals with dysthymia can benefit from getting regular physical exercise. Even if individuals have disabilities like chronic pain or an inability to stand, they may still be able to do modified workouts that accommodate their needs. Individuals can talk to a trainer about the best exercises for their health. Regardless of the type of workout, research has shown regular physical exercise improves the symptoms of both depression and anxiety. When an individual is exercising, their brain releases endorphins that make them feel good. Exercise also helps individuals become more aware of their body and surroundings, which takes their mind off their worries and sadness. In addition, exercise allows individuals to get more social interaction, build self-confidence, and develop a healthy coping mechanism for their dysthymia.</p></main>
