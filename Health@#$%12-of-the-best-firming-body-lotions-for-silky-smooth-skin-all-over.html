    <main><h1>12 of the Best Firming Body Lotions for Silky Smooth Skin All Over</h1><h2>Skin Firming & Toning Body Gel-Cream</h2><p>This almond-scented gel-cream from Nivea includes Q10, an antioxidant that helps with energy production in cells. “It helps to replenish the skin’s natural levels of collagen,” explains Dr. Ife, who, along with Dr. Jaliman, recommends this product. L-carnitine, a chemical that improves skin energy reserves, is another key ingredient. “It also has a cooling effect and absorbs quickly into the skin,” Dr. Ife adds.</p><figure><img title="Skin Firming & Toning Body Gel-Cream" src="IMG/AA1d7CR1_skin_firming_toning_body_gel_cream.jpg" alt="Skin Firming & Toning Body Gel-Cream"><figcaption><em>Skin Firming & Toning Body Gel-Cream. NIVEA</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Retinol Advanced Firming Cream</h2><h2>Positively Ageless Skin Strengthening Body Cream</h2><p>“This product contains a unique formula that helps to improve the skin’s elasticity and firmness,” says Dr. Ife. That includes moisturizing glycerin, dimethicone, and petrolatum. “It also contains natural ingredients such as southernwood extract and wheat protein.”</p><h2>Extra-Firming Body Cream</h2><p>Packed with many naturally derived ingredients, this firming body cream nourishes and tightens the skin while leaving behind a nice smell. That’s why it’s a favorite of Dr. Ife. “This product contains lemon thyme extract, which helps to firm and tone the skin,” she says. “It also has a luxurious texture and a pleasant scent.”</p><figure><img title="Extra-Firming Body Cream" src="IMG/AA1er00V_extra_firming_body_cream.jpg" alt="Extra-Firming Body Cream"><figcaption><em>Extra-Firming Body Cream. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Peptide Youth Restore Firming Body Serum</h2><p>Backed by Dr. Jaliman, this serum “contains peptides to stimulate collagen production as well as niacinamide, which improves skin texture and hydration,” she explains. “It also has hyaluronic acid for more moisture.”</p><h2>Vinosculpt Lift & Firm Body Cream</h2><p>This grape-based firming body cream from Caudalíe comes recommended by Dr. Jaliman, who points out that it contains hydrating shea butter and polyphenols to increase collagen production for that tightening effect. “It also has grape seed oil with a high concentration of antioxidants to defend against free radical damage.”</p><h2>Brazilian Bum Bum Cream</h2><p>This fan-favorite firming body lotion is packed with energizing ingredients to stimulate collagen production and give skin an overall tighter appearance. Key ingredients include guaraná extract, which contains five times more caffeine than coffee, according to the brand. It also uses moisturizing hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and coconut oil, as well as skincare powerhouses vitamin E and squalane.</p><p>An Amazon best-seller, it has thousands of five-star reviews. “I was skeptical but this stuff is good. My skin feels amazing for hours after use. I even like the scent, and I'm a picky scent person,” wrote one shopper.</p><h2>Undaria Algae Body Butter</h2><p>This ultra-hydrating body butter contains anti-aging ingredients to tackle crepey skin, including caffeine to stimulate collagen production. Tested and loved by <em>Prevention</em>’s senior commerce editor, it lives up to the hype and is worth the price tag. It’s a rich cream that takes some time to absorb into the skin but leaves it feeling smooth and hydrated all day long with no greasy residue left behind.</p><h2>Skin-Smoothing Retinol Body Treatment</h2><p>This unscented body lotion is a great choice for tackling a host of anti-aging skin concerns. It has antioxidants like vitamin C and E to protect the skin from free-radical damage and moisturizers like shea butter and evening primrose to nourish the skin. Mostly importantly for those interested in getting a firming effect from their body treatment, this cream also contains retinol to promote skin cell turnover and collagen production.</p><p>“It has significantly helped with my upper arms, evening the skin tone and improving the texture. They seemed to be losing elasticity and appearing older,” said one reviewer. “I feel amazing now and can show them again comfortably.”</p><figure><img title="Skin-Smoothing Retinol Body Treatment" src="IMG/AA1d7HCI_skin_smoothing_retinol_body_treatment.jpg" alt="Skin-Smoothing Retinol Body Treatment"><figcaption><em>Skin-Smoothing Retinol Body Treatment. Paula’s Choice</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Skin Firming Body Lotion</h2><p>“Finally, a lotion that actually works on my thin, dry older skin,” wrote one 78-year-old reviewer. “As soon as I tried this firming lotion I loved it. Smells great, feels great, and best of all, it worked for me.”</p><h2>Squalane + Caffeine Toning Body Cream</h2><p>Vegan squalane from sugarcane is the primary ingredient in this toning body cream from Biossance, making it an ultra-moisturizing pick. It also includes niacinamide to improve the skin’s texture and caffeine from green coffee beans to visibly firm the skin.</p><p>“I love the whipped texture, the minimal scent, and most of all, how deeply moisturizing this is,” said a Sephora shopper.</p><h2>The Body Cream</h2><p>This body cream is by far the most expensive on our list, but if you have it in your budget to splurge on a firming body lotion, you’ll want to consider this pick. It contains TCF8, a complex of amino acids, vitamins, and synthesized molecules naturally found in the skin. It also has bisabolol, a soothing compound that helps skin look and feel hydrated, a polysaccharide moisture complex to prevent water loss, and moisturizing shea butter. When used regularly, it promotes the appearance of firm, smooth, hydrated skin all over.</p><p>“My skin gets dry, and this is making things bouncy and soft,” said a Sephora customer who added that “a little bit of it goes a very long way.”</p><figure><img title="The Body Cream" src="IMG/AA1er01n_the_body_cream.jpg" alt="The Body Cream"><figcaption><em>The Body Cream. dermstore.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How to choose the best firming body lotion</h2><p><strong><strong>✔️</strong> Look for key ingredients. </strong>Effective firming body lotions include ingredients like caffeine, retinol, hyaluronic acids, and peptides, according to Dr. Ife. “Caffeine helps to reduce the appearance of cellulite, retinol stimulates collagen production, hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin, and peptides help to firm and tighten the skin,” she explains.</p><p><strong><strong>✔️</strong> Consider the scent and texture. </strong>The best scent and texture of a lotion may be different for everyone, so read some reviews to get a sense of whether you might like the smell and consistency of a firming body lotion before adding one to your virtual cart. As always, be wary of artificial fragrances, as they may cause skin irritation for some.</p><p><strong><strong>✔️</strong> Check the price tag. </strong>Firming body lotions cost a range of prices, from affordable to splurge-worthy. Decide how much you’re willing to invest in a product before setting your sights on a favorite.</p><h2>Benefits of firming body lotions</h2><p>A high-quality firming body lotion may help improve the feeling and appearance of skin. “The benefits of using this type of product regularly include improved skin elasticity, increased hydration, and a more toned and tightened appearance,” says Dr. Ife. “They improve the skin quality,” adds Dr. Jaliman, who notes that those with “crepey skin” (aka skin that becomes looser and thinner, typically with age and due to sun damage) often seek out this type of lotion.</p><h2>How we chose the best firming body lotions</h2><p>We interviewed Ife Rodney, M.D., F.A.A.D., a board-certified dermatologist and founding director of Eternal Dermatology in Fulton, MD., and Debra Jaliman, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and the author of <em>Skin Rules</em>, about how firming body lotions work and what to consider when shopping for this type of product. We took their criteria and personal product selections into consideration. We also sifted through customer reviews and ingredient lists of top-rated lotions from popular brands we know and love to come up with the best firming body lotions you can buy today.</p></main>
