    <main><h1>Why Does Hot Weather Kill Your Appetite? Find Out!</h1><p>As the seasons change and temperatures increase, many people find their appetites waning. While this might seem like an easy way to diet initially, it could harm your health if this lack of appetite persists. This is particularly true for young children and the elderly, who must be especially mindful of their dietary habits during the summer months.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loss of Appetite in Hot Weather</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1p714x_why_does_hot_weather_kill_your_appetite_find_out.jpg" alt="Why Does Hot Weather Kill Your Appetite? Find Out!"><figcaption><em>Why Does Hot Weather Kill Your Appetite? Find Out!. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Why does our appetite decrease when the weather gets hotter? Hot weather triggers the release of stress hormones that suppress our appetite. These hormones can also reduce our digestive abilities and slow down our production of digestive enzymes. When we eat in hot weather, our bodies naturally produce heat. To minimize this, our bodies release a hormone called leptin, resulting in suppressed appetite and a decreased desire to eat.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Autonomic Nervous System Imbalance is Another Factor</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1p6YCW_why_does_hot_weather_kill_your_appetite_find_out.jpg" alt="Why Does Hot Weather Kill Your Appetite? Find Out!"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>The difference in indoor and outdoor temperatures can also cause a diminishing appetite in the summer. Our autonomic nervous system balance can be disrupted when it’s hot outside but cold inside due to air conditioning. To adapt to the external environment, our sympathetic nervous system becomes activated. When this happens, the parasympathetic nervous system, which is involved in digestion, becomes suppressed. This leads to decreased stomach and intestinal function, poor digestion, and a natural reduction in the impulse for food.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Difference with Anorexia</h2><p>Appetite loss due to heat naturally recovers over time. However, anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder characterized by self-starvation, is a different matter. This condition can lead to weight loss, and in severe cases, it can result in death due to malnutrition. People with anorexia often deny the risks to their physical health and typically refuse help from others.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">If Loss of Appetite Persists for More Than Two Weeks</h2><p>If the loss of appetite due to heat persists for more than two weeks or your weight decreases, it might indicate a health problem. Long-term loss of appetite can weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of infections like gastroenteritis or food poisoning. This is especially true for older people, as their sense of smell, ability to regulate body temperature, and resistance to dehydration can decrease, leading to these symptoms more frequently.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increase Appetite by Eating Little and Often</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1p6MLK_why_does_hot_weather_kill_your_appetite_find_out.jpg" alt="Why Does Hot Weather Kill Your Appetite? Find Out!"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>When your appetite is low, you should gradually increase your food consumption and try to eat more frequently to stimulate your appetite. It’s best to avoid foods high in carbohydrates and fats, as they can slow down your metabolism. Instead, increase your intake of protein-rich foods like chicken or fish. Consuming vegetables and fruits rich in vitamins and minerals can also be beneficial.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sour Beverages Can Help</h2><p>Even when you’re not hungry, paying attention to nutrient intake is crucial. When you have no appetite, drinking sour beverages like Schisandra or Plum can help restore your appetite. These sour drinks stimulate saliva and gastric juice secretion, thereby improving digestion.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t Just Stay Indoors Because It’s Hot</h2><p>If you’re stuck indoors because it’s hot outside, piling energy can further suppress your appetite. Exercise is a great way to use energy and regain your appetite. If it’s too hot outside, consider doing light exercise indoors. Exercising outside is best when the sun is not at its strongest.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid Large Temperature Differences</h2><p>Rather than blasting the air conditioner because it’s hot, you should adjust the temperature so that the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures does not exceed 5℃ (41℉). There might be situations where you can’t adjust the air conditioner, so it can be helpful to carry long-sleeved clothing as a precaution. Drinking plenty of warm water can also help regulate body temperature and improve gastrointestinal function.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Proper Hydration is Important</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1p6OOm_why_does_hot_weather_kill_your_appetite_find_out.jpg" alt="Why Does Hot Weather Kill Your Appetite? Find Out!"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Proper hydration can stimulate appetite and improve digestion. Water supports the activity of digestive enzymes needed during digestion and aids in the efficient absorption of digested food. Drinking about 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day is advised. If your food intake decreases due to loss of appetite, you can stimulate your appetite by ensuring adequate digestion and maintaining a smooth process through hydration.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set Regular Meal Times and Intervals</h2><p>Setting regular meal times and intervals is beneficial to maintain a consistent appetite. Maintaining a regular pattern can help you avoid losing your appetite and allow you to enjoy healthy and delicious meals. Breakfast, in particular, is essential as it provides energy and stimulates metabolism, so make sure not to skip it. Maintaining three meals a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is ideal, including snacks between meals. If this is difficult due to losing appetite, try maintaining the three main meals.</p></main>
