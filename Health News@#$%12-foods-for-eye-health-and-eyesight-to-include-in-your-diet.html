Experts identified that vitamin A is vital for maintaining vision and eye function. Omega-3 fatty acids help prevent damage that may lead to vision loss or eye disease. And the antioxidant vitamin C can help protect the eyes from environmental or habit-related damage.</p><p>A diet low in fat and full of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can reduce the risk of developing eye diseases by keeping the arteries healthy to support the flow of oxygen and nutrients essential for eye health.</p><h2>Foods Good for Eye Health</h2><p>If you are looking to support or even improve your eye health, there are several foods that experts recommend intentionally including in your diet.</p><h3>Fish</h3><p>Fish like salmon and tuna contain the essential nutrients omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can benefit eye health.</p><p>A specific type of omega-3 known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) makes up the eye's retina and supports vision by reducing oxidative damage and improving blood flow.</p><p>Studies show that diets rich in omega-3s are linked to a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (or central vision loss) and slower cataract development.</p><h3>Nuts and Seeds</h3><p>Nuts and seeds contain vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin that protects the eyes' cellular health. Walnuts, almonds, pecans, and seeds like sunflower seeds can help decrease oxidative damage to the eyes, which may lower the risk of developing certain eye conditions, like cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p><p>Pistachios contain a rich supply of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin (antioxidants), which protect the eyes from various types of damage and support improved vision.</p><h3>Beans and Legumes</h3><p>Legumes (beans and lentils) are a good source of zinc. Research shows zinc is beneficial for people who have been diagnosed with AMD. It also helps produce the protective pigment melanin in the eyes by drawing vitamin A from the liver to the retina. This helps reduce poor night vision and cataracts.</p><h3>Citrus Fruits</h3><p>Citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and lemons are excellent sources of vitamin C, which can help protect the eyes from damage from free radicals (unstable molecules that can harm the DNA in cells) due to diet and environmental factors. By helping to repair and grow new cells, vitamin C may combat eye damage and age-related vision loss.</p><h3>Leafy Green Vegetables</h3><p>Leafy green vegetables like spinach, kale, or collard greens contain lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamins A, C, and K, and antioxidants, supporting eye health. Specifically, getting enough of your leafy greens can help protect the macula, the part of the eye that provides detailed central vision.</p><h3>Carrots</h3><p>Studies show that foods rich in beta-carotene, like carrots, are good sources of vitamin A, which can help enhance night vision and the ability to see better in lower or dim lighting.</p><h3>Sweet Potatoes</h3><p>Sweet potatoes are another good source of beta-carotene and vitamin A. They contain more vitamin A than carrots and provide more than 200% of the daily recommended intake of the vitamin. This supports the retina's ability to translate light rays into vision and keeps eyes moist enough to prevent dry eyes.</p><h3>Eggs</h3><p>Egg yolks contain eye-healthy lutein and zeaxanthin, decreasing the progression of eye diseases like AMD. At least one study found that consuming anywhere between two and four eggs per week resulted in a 62% reduced risk of developing AMD, compared to consuming just one egg a week or less.</p><h3>Raw Bell Peppers</h3><p>The antioxidants in bell peppers can protect against cellular damage and maintain blood flow to the eyes by supporting the blood vessels. Adding this veggie to your diet can benefit overall eye function and healthy vision. Its vitamin C content is also linked to a reduced risk of developing eye conditions like AMD.</p><h3>Squash</h3><p>The vitamins A and C in squash help protect the eyes and reduce night blindness. It may also prevent or at least slow the progression of conditions like cataracts and AMD.</p><h3>Broccoli and Brussels Sprouts</h3><p>Broccoli and Brussels sprouts are rich in fiber and other nutrients, like carotenoids and vitamin C. One research review found that consuming 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C daily may lower the risk of developing cataracts by almost 20%.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that the highest intake of the carotenoid beta-carotene in broccoli is connected to a 10% reduced risk of developing cataracts.</p><p>While you may think of it as a beverage, experts technically consider water a food. Because the eyes are comprised of mostly water, staying hydrated can impact eye health.</p><p>Dehydration can lead to dry eyes, irritation, temporarily blurred vision, eye floaters, and more. If dry eye symptoms are not treated properly, dry eye can potentially lead to vision changes, which is all the more reason to keep hydrated throughout the day.</p><h2>How Much of These Foods Should You Eat?</h2><p>It's important to ensure you get enough of the vitamins and minerals that are key to protecting eye health. The daily values of eye health nutrients that experts generally recommend most adults consume include:</p><ul><li><strong>Vitamin A: </strong>900 micrograms (mcg)</li><li><strong>Vitamin C: </strong>90 mg</li><li><strong>Vitamin E:</strong> 15 mg</li><li><strong>Zinc:</strong> 11 mg</li></ul><p>Examples of how to incorporate eye-healthy foods include:</p><ul><li>One cup of cooked carrot slices equals more than 100% of your daily vitamin A value.</li><li>One cup of raw broccoli provides around 90% of daily vitamin C needs.</li><li>One cup of sliced red peppers offers more than 100% of vitamin C needs.</li><li>A 1-ounce serving of almonds is about 50% of your daily recommended intake of vitamin E.</li><li>Three tablespoons of hemp seeds can provide up to 40% of your daily zinc needs.</li></ul><h2>Getting Eye-Healthy Nutrients From Food vs. Vitamins and Supplements</h2><p>If you cannot get enough of the recommended nutrients from your diet, an eye healthcare provider may recommend utilizing certain supplements. People with intermediate AMD in one or both eyes may be prescribed antioxidant supplements, which include vitamins C, E, and zinc.</p><p>People with a history of smoking may want to look for an eye health supplement that does not contain beta-carotene, which in some studies was found to increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Check with a healthcare provider before trying an eye-health antioxidant supplement.</p><h2>Other Tips for Eye Health</h2><p>Some steps that experts recommend to keep your eyes as healthy as possible are:</p><ul><li>Get plenty of exercise to help prevent or manage high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, which may contribute to eye or vision issues.</li><li>Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight or having obesity can make it more likely to develop diabetes, leading to eye-damaging conditions like glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy.</li><li>Wear sunglasses that block out 99% to 100% of UV radiation. The sun’s rays can cause damage and increase the risk of cataracts and AMD.</li><li>Wear protective eyewear to protect your eyes from sports-related injuries, construction or factory jobs, and home repair projects.</li><li>Quit smoking. This habit can increase the risk of AMD and cataracts and damage the optic nerve.</li><li>Rest your eyes to reduce eyestrain, mainly if you use the computer. Look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.</li><li>If you wear contact lenses, wash your hands before putting in or taking out contact lenses to prevent eye infections. Replace them as instructed by your healthcare provider and the product's intended use.</li><li>Be aware of your family medical history and other risk factors. Certain eye diseases are genetic and cannot be prevented, while others may be prevented with behavioral or environmental changes.</li></ul><h2>Eye Health Warning Signs</h2><p>Eye and vision issues are common and can go unnoticed for quite some time. Certain eye conditions like cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration can lead to vision loss or blindness if not treated early. This is why seeing a healthcare provider for a comprehensive eye exam is essential.</p><p>If you notice any of the following symptoms, check with a healthcare provider:</p><ul><li>Decreased or blurry vision</li><li>Eye swelling</li><li>Eye redness</li><li>Eye pain</li><li>Sensitivity to light</li><li>Floaters (specks that seem to drift or float in front of the eyes)</li><li>Halos or circles around lights</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Several nutrients are important for supporting eye health, including vitamins C, E, and A, zinc, and carotenoids. Research suggests that getting plenty of these key nutrients may help protect against age-related eye diseases and vision loss.</p><p>You can include more of these in your diet by consuming staples like fish, carrots, citrus fruits, nuts, eggs, peppers, and leafy greens. Check with a healthcare provider before adding dietary supplements to your daily routine.</p></main>
