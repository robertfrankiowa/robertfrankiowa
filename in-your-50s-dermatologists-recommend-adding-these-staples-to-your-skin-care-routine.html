After all, each decade comes with unique complexion concerns, and what worked for you five years ago might suddenly irritate you to no end.</p><p>If you're approaching your 50s — or are already 50 and fabulous — you might be wondering where you should focus your attention and what skin care products you should be using. To help, Shop TODAY consulted several top dermatologists to come up with our list of skin care products for glowing, youthful skin in your 50s and beyond.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see their advice and picks, or use the links below to jump to a specific category.</p><p><strong>What to look for</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Best sunscreens</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Best cleansers</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Best eye creams</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Best retinols and serums</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Best night moisturizers</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Meet our experts</strong></p><h2>What should I consider when building a skin care routine in my 50s?</h2><p>Our expert dermatologists advise women over 50 to incorporate the following into their skin care routine:</p><ul><li><strong>Sun protection.</strong> When it comes to avoiding damage from UV rays and preventing skin cancer, experts say sunscreen is an absolute must. "Sun protection in your 50s can help slow down aging but also decrease the risk of developing basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma," says Dr. Maral Kibarian Skelsey, director of the Dermatologic Surgery Center of Washington and clinical associate professor of dermatology at Georgetown University.</li><li><strong>Non-drying, barrier-strengthening ingredients</strong>. "Choose gentle, soap-free cleansers or creamy cleansers with barrier-strengthening and moisturizing ingredients. These types of cleansers are less likely to strip the skin of its natural oils and cause more dryness," Dr. Sejal K. Shah of New York City's SmarterSkin Dermatology tells us.</li><li><strong>Gentle exfoliants.</strong> "Cell turnover slows down as we age, so our skin loses the youthful glow and looks dull. Avoid harsh scrubs since mature skin is thinner and less resilient," says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jessie Cheung of Chicago's Cheung Aesthetics and Wellness.</li><li><strong>The right eye cream.</strong> "Eye cream is important in your 50s, as the skin under the eyes is thinner and more sensitive," dermatologist Dr. David E. Bank says.</li><li><strong>Retinoids and antioxidants.</strong> "Retinoids are the gold standard anti-aging treatment product," says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Annie Chiu of The Derm Institute. "Use them at least once a day to help with fine lines, collagen boosting, wrinkle prevention and dull skin cell turnover," she adds. And antioxidants like vitamin C can protect skin from free radicals and cumulative damage.</li><li><strong>Heavier moisturizers and creams.</strong> "The oil glands in the skin slow down significantly in this decade," Chiu explains. "Replenishing that skin barrier health is important by using a slightly heavier moisturizer than you might have used in your 20s or 30s, when you were worried about breaking out."</li></ul><h2>Best sunscreen for your 50s</h2><h3>EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46</h3><p>UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46</p><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1hcrjp_in_your_50s_dermatologists_recommend_adding_these_staples_to_your_skin_care_routine.jpg" alt="In your 50s?

In fact, former Shop TODAY associate editor Fran Sales, who has combination skin that gets severely dry around the nose and cheeks, can use this daily (sometimes twice a day) and feel thoroughly cleansed but not stripped of moisture.</p><h3>Garnier SkinActive Micellar Waterproof Makeup Removing Towelettes </h3><p>Micellar Waterproof Makeup Removing Towelettes</p><p><strong>Amount: </strong>25 wipes per one package<strong> | Skin type: </strong>All skin types, including sensitive<strong> | Key ingredients: </strong>No notable callouts, but free of fragrances, parabens and sulfates. </p><p>When you're wearing makeup, sometimes it's helpful to start off with a makeup-removing wipe to thoroughly cleanse your skin. Garnier's micellar water wipes gently banish oil, dirt and makeup without irritating skin and are the perfect first step in any cleansing routine.</p><p>"Micellar water is a good way to remove makeup without drying out the skin," Skelsey says.
