    <main><h1>How to turn your home into a wellness sanctuary</h1><p>When we’re feeling overwhelmed, sometimes there is nothing more comforting than retreating to our house. But as hybrid work becomes increasingly common in the wake of COVID, being able to separate work and other stresses from our downtime is important for our mental health. The best way to discourage stress in the home is through a wellness sanctuary.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a wellness sanctuary?</strong></h2><p>According to interior designer Kellie Richardson, a wellness sanctuary “is a space in the home where you can relax, unwind and indulge in activities you enjoy that help you disconnect from the stress and busyness of life.”</p><p>An environment like this can be incredibly beneficial for our health as it allows us to decompress, relax and recharge. </p><p><strong>“</strong>Creating a specific area in your home solely for the purpose of being a wellness sanctuary is growing in popularity as people look for ways to unwind and destress,” says Kellie. “It is important to ensure that you keep work, study and other stressful activities out of your sanctuary.”</p><p>“Relaxing is good for our immune system because it floods your body with feel-good hormones like dopamine and serotonin, while reducing the impact of the stress hormone cortisol.”</p><figure><img title="Provided by Australian Women's Weekly" src="IMG/AA1hBz8i_candle_in_small_amber_glass_jar_with_wooden_wick_on_wooden_stand_on_background_copy_space.jpg" alt="Candle in small amber glass jar with wooden wick on wooden stand on background.

If you need to, use screens to create privacy.”</p><p>Once you have picked a location, declutter the space.</p><p>“Remove anything that does not contribute to the feeling of being a sanctuary,” says Kellie. “Untidy and cluttered spaces make it difficult to relax and let go of stress.”</p><p>Then it’s time to decorate the space to inform calmness and relaxation. Here’s how.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interior</strong></h4><p>“Opt for calming colours,” says Kellie. “By bringing in blues, greens and earthly colours into a wellness space, you can create a de-stressed, harmonious environment that diffuses anxiety.”</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nature artworks</strong></h4><p><strong> “</strong>Having artworks that contain nature give our bodies a sense of peace and tranquillity, allowing our bodies to relate to the images and grounding us to nature,” she says.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Environmental music</strong></h4><p><strong> “</strong>Playing gentle music or nature sounds allows our mind and body to unwind, relax and creates inner peace,” explains the interior designer.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Australian Women's Weekly" src="IMG/AA1hBpWe_how_to_turn_your_home_into_a_wellness_sanctuary.jpg" alt="How to turn your home into a wellness sanctuary"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Australian Women's Weekly</em></figcaption></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Décor</strong></h4><p><strong> “</strong>Add décor that provides a feeling of luxury,” says Kellie, suggesting a relaxing chair and cushions, a soft rug and throws, and a lamp with a low volt bulb. </p><p>“If you would like to undertake some sewing or craft activity, include a small desk and chair as well,” she adds. “If you are a reader, include a book shelf.</p><p>“Add pops of colour through vases, mugs, note pads and pillows to keep your mood positive and happy.”</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plants</strong></h4><p>“Plants are calming,” says Kellie. “They are said to have restorative and healing qualities. Add a few pots around your space to add greenery.”</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Storage</strong></h4><p>“Add a few storage boxes to your wellness space so you can easily access equipment such as craft activities and low impact gym gear,” says Kellie.</p><p>“This will also keep your area neat and tidy when the equipment is not in use.”</p><figure><img title="Provided by Australian Women's Weekly" src="IMG/AA1hBBeH_an_opened_book_with_a_cup_of_tea_on_her_side_reading_a_book_on_the_bed.jpg" alt="An opened book with a cup of tea on her side, reading a book on the bed."><figcaption><em>An opened book with a cup of tea on her side, reading a book on the bed..

Floor matts are also great for meditation.” </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Craft activities and mini library</strong></h4><p>“If craft or reading is something you enjoy, create a mini library or a craft corner,” suggests the interior designer.</p><p>“Again, items can be stored in containers when not in use. When reading, try and read paperback books. The idea of a wellness sanctuary is to get away from screens and calm the mind.”</p><p>“It is important to ensure that your wellness area is peaceful and soothing,” implores Kellie, suggesting the addition of humidifiers, oil diffusers and fairy lights.  </p><p>“Candles are also a nice way to add a feeling of charm and comfort,” she adds. “Scented candles are ideal. A stylish floor lamp also helps to add a feeling of luxury and adds to the ambience of the space.</p><p>The interior designer continues: “Don’t forget to add music. Calm, soothing music with sounds of the ocean, is a must especially when you are undertaking yoga. When you listen to music while doing yoga, you get more oxygen because you are breathing in rhythm.”</p></main>
