    <main><h1>How well do Americans understand heart disease such as heart attacks or angina pectoris?</h1><figure><img title="LAM YIK (Reuters)" src="IMG/BB1oGXXG_valentines_day_in_hong_kong.jpg" alt="Valentine's Day in Hong Kong"><figcaption><em>Heart disease is the world’s number one killer but very few people know life-saving treatment such as CPR.. LAM YIK (Reuters)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, <b>claiming </b><b>one life every 33 seconds</b>. Despite this alarming statistic, recent research suggests that many Americans may not fully grasp the severity of the situation or the importance of preventative measures and emergency response.</p><p>A study conducted by ProTrainings <b>analyzed US Google search trends related to cardiovascular disease and first aid techniques</b>, revealing some concerning patterns in public awareness and regional disparities in heart health.</p><h2>The study in more detail</h2><p>One of the most striking findings is the geographical distribution of poor heart health and cardiovascular deaths. <b>Southern states consistently lead the nation in these grim statistics, with higher rates of cardiovascular-related fatalities per 100,000 residents</b>. This trend highlights the need for targeted interventions and improved healthcare access in these regions.</p><ol> <li>Mississippi: 41%</li> <li>Louisiana: 40%</li> <li>Florida: 39%</li> <li>Texas: 39%</li> <li>Alabama: 39%</li> <li>New Mexico: 39% </li> <li>Alaska: 39%</li> <li>Georgia: 38%</li> <li>South Carolina: 38%</li> <li>Arkansas: 38% </li> </ol><p>Perhaps most alarming is the revelation that <b>60% of Americans who suffer from cardiac arrest outside of a hospital setting never receive assistance from someone trained in CPR or first aid</b>. This statistic emphasizes the critical need for widespread CPR training and public education on emergency response techniques.</p><p>On a more positive note, <b>the study found that over 60% of search traffic across all states indicates a desire to learn more about CPR training</b>. This interest suggests a growing awareness of the importance of these life-saving skills and presents an opportunity for increased public health initiatives focused on CPR education.</p><h2>Learning more about heart disease</h2><p><b>Heart attacks</b> occur when blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked, often due to a blood clot. In the United States, someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds about 805,000 people a year.</p><p>Importantly, <b>about 1 in 5 heart attacks are “silent” </b>- the damage is done, but the person is not aware of it. Symptoms of a heart attack can include chest pain or discomfort, upper back or neck pain, heartburn, nausea or vomiting, extreme fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.</p><p>If you are aware you are having a heart attack, <b>call 911 as soon as possible</b>.</p><p><b>Angina Pectoris</b><b> is different</b>. This is a chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle doesn’t get enough oxygen-rich blood. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease, where plaque builds up in the arteries supplying the heart.</p><p><b>Angina can feel like pressure or squeezing in the chest</b>, and may also be felt in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It is a <b>chronic and potentially life-threatening condition</b> that requires medical treatment. Treatments for angina include medications, procedures to open blocked arteries, and lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and improving diet. <b>Angina can develop into a heart attack</b> if not treated. </p></main>
