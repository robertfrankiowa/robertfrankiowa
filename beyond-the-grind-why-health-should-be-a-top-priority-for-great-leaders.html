Photo: Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><p class='fl-subtitle'>In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship, the hustle mindset often overshadows the importance of health, but it shouldn't.</p><p>Early in my career, I focused on the hustle mindset, often working 100-hour weeks and making work the top priority. Over time, as I've become more professionally mature, I've come to realize family, friends, and overall work-life balance are more important. However, it wasn't until this year that I realized that one thing specifically should really take priority -- my health. </p><p>Typically, I tend to push through colds, sicknesses, and other things like that. I have had the mindset that I had to move past them, so I didn't slow down when I should probably have taken time to recover. This year I wasn't able to do that. Something didn't feel right, and although my new doctor disagreed with my feeling that something was wrong, I still pushed forward. (Note to readers, champion your own health, and don't let a doctor tell you that you have nothing to worry about when you know in your heart something is off.)</p><p>After having challenges and delays, I posted in an entrepreneur group that I'm a part of looking to get some advice. Fortunately for me, someone cared enough to immediately respond. Andrew Herr, the founder and CEO of Fount, who incidentally spearheaded human performance and biotech strategy initiatives for the U.S. military, advised me to seek another opinion.</p><p>After some tests, I realized that I had something fairly serious that needed to be dealt with.</p><p>I'm thankful Andrew stepped up and got me on a path to prioritize my health, and here are some tips I've learned while going through the experience. </p><h2>1. Personalize your health solutions</h2><p>When I got my blood tested the first time, the doctor basically said, "Looks great. You are in the proper range." However, ranges are national averages, and they don't necessarily reflect where you want to be. Optimal health can vary slightly from person to person. Factors like age, sex, medical history, and medications can influence where within the range is ideal for you.</p><p>The blood test was also fairly generic. Normally, blood tests are just a routine check for things like blood cell counts as well as hemoglobin, cholesterol, and glucose levels. Doctors want to make sure you aren't dying, but most medical professionals aren't going on a mission to learn everything about you. Additional blood tests can check for nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, or even genetic markers, but that doesn't happen every time -- if ever.</p><p>When Andrew ordered my blood work, there were many things tested that I had no idea about. Getting more information that was specific to my health was truly life-changing. Knowing more information about yourself is one of the best ways to give your body the care it needs. You don't want to treat an unknown condition with generic treatment. </p><p>Often, relying solely on generic supplements or multivitamins is akin to taking a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not address the unique needs of your body and could potentially overlook underlying health issues. It's like applying a band-aid when surgery might be required -- it might provide temporary relief, but it doesn't solve the root problem.</p><h2>2. Some short-term sacrifices can pay long-term dividends</h2><p>I learned from Fount that one of the best ways to identify what's going on with your body is doing experiments to test how your body responds to certain factors. For example, documenting what food you eat can give you a clear idea about what gives you energy and what drains you or causes other negative reactions. During my tracking process, I realized that certain foods indeed gave me more energy, and other kinds brought me down. </p><p>In addition, I found certain habits I had, like eating late when work takes over my time, can have an impact on health. Consuming heavy meals close to bedtime disrupts sleep patterns and can leave you feeling sluggish the next day. I've found that consistently prioritizing work over adequate nutrition and rest can lead to increased stress levels and compromise overall well-being.</p><p>Making sure you focus on identifying real problems is important to success. Once you find areas where you can improve, you can get rid of bad habits in the short term to pave the way for long-term health and vitality.</p><h2>3. Surround yourself with good people who support your health</h2><p>Going through this made me realize that certain people probably shouldn't be in my inner circle. Before posting in the entrepreneur group that I'm in with Andrew, I sent messages to a few friends who are doctors in the area, and I got generic responses or no response at all. Experts who I've been friends with for a while weren't too helpful, but Andrew, who was an acquaintance, immediately jumped to help.</p><p>Similarly, my business partner and other entrepreneurs pushed me to focus on my health first. Having those people in your life, who are there for you when you need them, is vital. You want people in your circle who will keep you focused on your health. If you're surrounded by acquaintances who are always encouraging you to have late blackout nights or partake in other bad health habits, it's probably time to question those relationships.</p><p>As an entrepreneur and leader, health often takes a back burner when career commitments, personal relationships, and social obligations demand more immediate attention. Unfortunately, mine caught up with me, but it didn't have to be that way. Luckily, Andrew was there for me when I needed it most. I hope you read this and can take action to avoid letting your health fall by the wayside amidst the hustle of life. </p><p>It's crucial to prioritize self-care and listen to your body's signals before serious health issues arise. Don't get to the point of not catching things in time. It's hard to build companies and be a good parent or spouse if you don't have your health, so it needs to be a number one priority.</p></main>
