Stop stepping on every gum stain you see. You don't need to do that,'" he said.</p><h2>Amanda Seyfried</h2><p>In a 2016 interview, Amanda Seyfried spoke openly about her battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which she has struggled with since her teenage years.

Additionally, therapy was also a significant source of support for her.</p><h2>Gillian Anderson</h2><p>After releasing her book, Gillian Anderson opened up about her struggles with mental health and her journey towards recovery.
