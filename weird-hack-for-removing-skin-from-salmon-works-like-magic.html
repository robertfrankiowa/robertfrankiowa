One such food is fish because there are so many things to consider, like the bones and the skin. If you want to cook more salmon, though, there are ways to easily remove the skin that do not have to feel intimidating.</p><p>Some people like to keep the skin on fish because you can make it crispy and well-seasoned. Some people find that salmon skin can have a strong, fishy flavor and it can also have a slightly chewy or rubbery texture when cooked. While salmon skin is edible and contains some nutrients, it can also contain higher levels of heavy metals and pollutants. </p><p>Ultimately, whether or not you remove the skin from salmon comes down to personal preference and the specific dish you're preparing, but for the reasons listed above many people prefer to remove the skin before cooking the fish. </p><p>The problem is that it can be hard and time-consuming to do properly, and if you're new to cooking fish, this can be a deterrent to cooking the fish. One TikTok hack is teaching people the fastest and easiest way to remove salmon skin, though, and it's so weird that we can't believe it works, but it does. </p><h2>This Seems Too Easy</h2><p>The hack is as simple as placing the raw salmon on a wire rack in a sink. Then, you slowly pour boiling water over the skin. As you do, the fish will convulse and move, like it's alive, but it's simply the skin separating from the meat. </p><p>Pour the water across the skin for a few seconds and it will simply slip right off, leaving you with smooth, skinless salmon to cook. It's truly that simple! </p><h2>People Were Shocked</h2><p>Most people in the comments to the video said they prefer the skin of the fish, but for those who do like skinless salmon, this was a hack they loved. </p><p>"Very cool hack," one person said. </p><p>"I have to try this," another said. </p><p>Others were a little taken aback by how the fish moved when the water was poured on it. </p><p>"I thought the fish was still alive," someone commented. </p><p>Others said that while the hack is cool, you don't want to place salmon in the sink for this trick because of the potential for germs. You can also put the wire rack over a pot or a casserole dish to do this hack. We think this hack is worth a try!  </p></main>
