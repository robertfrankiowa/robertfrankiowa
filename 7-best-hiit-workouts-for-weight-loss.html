    <main><h1>7 Best HIIT Workouts for Weight Loss</h1><p>What are the keys to losing weight? First, eat the right diet—that's non-negotiable. Second, do the right exercise program. With a great training routine, you'll burn far more calories, increase your metabolism, and build muscle underneath the fat so you get leaner. One of the best and most popular methods for weight loss is high-intensity interval training (HIIT). To ensure you're on the right track in your fitness regimen, we put together seven of the best HIIT workouts for weight loss you can start doing today.</p><p>HIIT is simple: You do a short burst of intense exercise, take a short rest, and then repeat for multiple rounds. This puts a massive demand on your body to burn more calories than an equally steady cardio session. Also, you get an "afterburn" effect where your body burns more calories after you finish your training. The result? A leaner, fitter body.</p><p>Below, you'll find seven incredible HIIT workouts for weight loss. We recommend doing these as a "finisher" at the end of your workout. Avoid doing these in the beginning because you'll exhaust yourself and possibly compromise your technique. For best results, follow the rest time correctly and push yourself hard. Finally, do these two to three times a week, max.</p><p>Keep reading for our seven best HIIT workouts for weight loss.

Squat down, and explode into the air, switching legs, and landing in the opposite stance. Alternate quickly, and jump as high as you can each time.</p><h3>2) Plyometric Pushups (15 seconds, 30 seconds rest)</h3><p>Get in a pushup position with your hands about shoulder-width apart. Keep your lower back flat, and don't let your hips sag. Lower yourself, and keep your elbows close to your body as you descend. From the bottom, explosively push yourself so your arms get off the ground.</p><h3>3) Jump Squats (15 seconds, 30 seconds rest)</h3><p>Stand shoulder-width apart with your feet slightly turned out. Place your hands behind your head. Squat down, sit back, and spread your knees apart. Keep your weight on your heels. Once you descend below parallel, explode up and jump as high as you can.</p><p>Repeat these exercises 10 times.</p><h2>Workout 3: Kettlebells</h2><h3>1. Kettlebell Swings (20 seconds, 40 seconds rest, repeat 10 t0 15 times)</h3><p>Start in a deadlift position with the kettlebell a few feet in front of you. Then, hike the kettlebell back between your legs, and explosively drive your hips forward. Swing the kettlebell up to the rack position. Repeat.</p><p>Don't use your arm to yank the kettlebell. This will pull the kettlebell away from your body and then slam onto your arm. Instead, as you swing up, keep your elbow jammed to your ribcage, keep it there, and spin your hand. Also, try starting the kettlebell in the rack position. Then, swing it between your legs and return to the rack position.</p><h2>Workout 4: Battle Ropes</h2><ul><li>20 seconds on</li><li>40 seconds off</li><li>Repeat 10 to 15 rounds</li></ul><h2>Workout 5: Tabata</h2><h3>1.

Stand shoulder-width apart with your toes slightly out. Start the movement by sitting backward and spreading your knees apart. Descend below parallel while keeping your lower back flat. At the bottom, drive through your heels, and keep your knees apart.</p><h2>Workout 6: Ladders</h2><p>Alternate between two exercises and do 10 reps of each, then nine reps of each, then eight… all the way to one rep each. Rest for 30 seconds between sets.</p><h3>1. Bodyweight Squats</h3><p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your toes slightly out.
