She Regenerates Her Skin</h2><p>Hayek has amazing skin, and she makes sure to take care of it. She shared her biggest secret in an interview with <i>ELLE.</i> "I use an ingredient called tepezcohuite that's used in Mexico for burn victims because it completely regenerates the skin, and there's no one in the States who is using this ingredient except for us. Some of the ingredients, when I took them to the American labs, they were like 'Oh my god! How come nobody is using this?' This is why I have no Botox, no peels, no fillings. I'm 48. I will be 49 this year and I only use my creams."</p><figure><img title="1. She Regenerates Her Skin" src="IMG/AA1dsvOz_1_she_regenerates_her_skin.jpg" alt="1.

She Loves Juice Cleanses</h2><p>Hayek is open about her love of juice cleanses. She even has her own company, Cooler Cleanse. She opened up about this on the Cooler Cleanse website. "After doing a juice cleanse, I'm motivated to eat healthier and not emotionally. Cleansing is like my meditation. It makes me stop, focus and think about what I'm putting into my body. I'm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button."</p><figure><img title="2. She Loves Juice Cleanses" src="IMG/AA1dsfGH_2_she_loves_juice_cleanses.jpg" alt="2.

She Puts Effort In</h2><p>Hayek makes sure that her projects are perfect. On an episode of CNBC's <i>Make It</i>, she talked about the process of creating Cooler Cleanse. "Never rush or force anything. We worked together for about two years developing the concepts and recipes for both Cooler Cleanse and Blend It Yourself. So be patient. It takes time if you want to do things right."</p><figure><img title="3. She Puts Effort In" src="IMG/AA1dsafq_3_she_puts_effort_in.jpg" alt="3. She Puts Effort In"><figcaption><em>3.

She tells <i>People</i> that she has to do restorative yoga throughout the day for this reason. "I work with a woman in London who taught me how to hold my body in a way where the muscles are activated all day long. So even when you brush your teeth, you're working the muscles. It's restorative yoga."</p><h2>5. She’s Comfortable</h2><p>Hayek isn't afraid of showing off her body. She tells <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> that she has a lot of comfort in her body. "I had to lose a lot of weight and exercise to get into the bikini towards the end of last year. I'm glad I took a lot of pictures, I have no shame on it, because it was the first week of the vacation."</p><h2>6. She Enjoys Herself</h2><p>Hayek opened up about her wellbeing secrets to <i>Glamour</i><i>. </i>She says that she makes sure to enjoy herself. "Have fun, laugh, make yourself laugh. Tell yourself a joke. Be silly when nobody's watching. It's about that time you spend with yourself. It's hard for me to find that space, so I now make a really big effort to enjoy it very much. Because in modern life, it's hard. Especially if you're married and with children. Go hide somewhere and feel it."</p><h2>7. She Doesn’t Dwell On Things</h2><p>Hayek tells <i>Glamour </i>that she doesn't like to dwell on her problems. "Don't go over your problems when you're taking a shower, when you're taking a bath. Feel the water. If you get a chance to go in the ocean, go to the ocean. Walk on the sand; feel the grass under your toes. Feel the sun; feel the wind. Don't get too busy in your head that you don't see it."</p></main>
