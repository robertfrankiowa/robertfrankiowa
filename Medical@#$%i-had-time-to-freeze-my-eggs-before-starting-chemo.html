BBC</em></figcaption></figure><p>A west Belfast woman says she was lucky to have been given time to freeze her eggs before starting chemotherapy in her fight against cancer.</p><p>Maria Austin, 25, who is a classroom assistant, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in January.</p><p>"The egg freezing was crucial and so important because I am still young, I want to have a family when I am older," she said. </p><p>Maria said she is telling her story to highlight the importance of early cancer diagnosis and to help other young people cope with symptoms she describes as "life changing".</p><h2>'Why me?'</h2><p>"Chemo and cancer affects fertility and can put you into early menopause," she told BBC News NI.</p><p>"To have that wee window of two weeks to go through fertility treatment, it was hard, it was three needles a day, but I am fortunate I had the opportunity." </p><p>Maria, who underwent four rounds of chemotherapy, said at the start she kept asking “why me?”.</p><p>She said the constant sickness and losing her hair was hard.</p><p>"One day my hair just kept falling out - within four weeks I had no hair left," she said.</p><p>"That was a challenge, and I am now using wigs and headscarves. I have tried to find beauty somewhere else, so I am working on my make-up."</p><p>Maria’s chemotherapy has worked. A recent PET scan revealed the tumour had shrunk.</p><p>Now she willl have radiotherapy treatment instead.</p><figure><img title="BBC" src="IMG/BB1pEalC_maria_has_been_wearing_wigs_and_headscarves_since_undergoing_chemotherapy.jpg" alt="Maria has been wearing wigs and headscarves since undergoing chemotherapy"><figcaption><em>Maria has been wearing wigs and headscarves since undergoing chemotherapy.

BBC</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sam said living with cancer was a "tough journey" that affected everyone at home.</p><p>"It affects everyone’s life; you are talking about your new normal, but nothing is normal," he said.</p><p>"It impacts everything - your whole approach to the future."</p><h2>Raising awareness</h2><p>Maria and Sam are both positive, humble, and extremely grateful people.</p><p>While filming their stories there were tears and laughter.</p><p>Maria said she had turned her diagnosis into something positive and that lots of people had got in touch by social media.</p><p>“There isn’t a lot of support out there for young people with cancer, the body image side effects including the weight gain and hair loss – if I can help I will,” she said.</p><p>"Don't let that word 'cancer' drag you down, be positive and if you have that positive attitude those around you will be positive.</p><p>"Don't let it the word 'cancer' or 'sufferer' determine you, just be a fighter." </p><p>Sam said he was now half Welsh as his stem cell donor was from Wales and he called on the public to sign up to the stem cell register.</p><p>"His blood and his stem cells were grafted into me and make up my white blood cells, so my blood type ended up changing to his - it’s remarkable what happens but his donation has kept me alive," he said.</p><p>"So, it’s not just about chemo and radiotherapy it is also about the public, opening up their minds to see what they can do to help those living with cancer."</p><figure><img title="BBC" src="IMG/BB1pEalK_sam_and_his_stem_cell_match.jpg" alt="Sam and his stem cell match"><figcaption><em>Sam and his stem cell match.

It develops when blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal.</p><p>Normal lymphocytes fight infection. They are part of the lymphatic system which helps protect your body from infection and disease.</p><p>There are two main types of lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>When someone has Hodgkin lymphoma, HL B-lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system such as the lymph nodes (glands). </p><p>The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit, or groin.</p><p>Cancers diagnosed in people aged between 18 and 49 in Northern Ireland have risen by 20% in the past 25 years.</p><p>The research carried out by Queen's University Belfast and the NI Cancer Registry compared 2019 statistics with 1993 figures, when registry records began.</p><p>Figures showed that by 2019, 1,076 people aged 18-49 were diagnosed with some form of cancer.</p><p>The latest cancer waiting statistics are due to be published later on Tuesday.</p></main>
