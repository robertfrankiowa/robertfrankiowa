    <main><h1>Underweight? Why It Might Be Worse Than Obesity for Your Health</h1><p>Many people strive to lose weight to achieve lean figures. However, being underweight carries as many consequences as being overweight. Being severely underweight can weaken bones, muscles, and organs, increasing the risk of various diseases. It is also dangerous to indiscriminately gain weight from a poor diet. So, how should one gain weight healthily?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Dangers of Being Underweight</h2><p>Being underweight means the body lacks the necessary nutrients, which can decrease cellular metabolism and weaken the immune system. Weaker bones increase the risk of osteoporosis, and lack of muscles increases the risk of fractures. These fractures can lead to decreased mobility and respiratory function and, in severe cases, even death.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are the Criteria for Being Underweight?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pu9SG_underweight_why_it_might_be_worse_than_obesity_for_your_health.jpg" alt="Underweight? Why It Might Be Worse Than Obesity for Your Health"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>When a person’s weight is significantly less than a healthy standard, it is considered underweight. Organizations such as the Korean Society of Obesity generally define underweight as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 18.5.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weakened Immunity Due to Nutrient Deficiency</strong></h2><p>A lack of nutrients can weaken the immune systems, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Research has shown that underweight people have more than twice the risk of developing tuberculosis. Therefore, maintaining a healthy weight is important to boost your immunity. If you struggle to gain weight, try supplements with your usual diet.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increased Risk of Dementia</h2><p>The risk of dementia also increases if you are underweight because the brain lacks essential nutrients like vitamins D and E. It has been studied that people with lower BMI are more prone to dementia. Those with a BMI of less than 20 had a 34% higher risk of developing dementia compared to those with an average BMI of 20-24.9.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">A healthy and Balanced Diet is Important</h2><p>Some advise simply eating a lot if you want to gain weight. However, that is dangerous advice. If you reduce your physical activity and consume high-calorie foods to gain weight, you will only increase visceral fat, leading to skinny obesity or abdominal obesity. Habits like eating late or overeating can also lead to digestive disorders.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choose Meat Over Beans for Protein</h2><p>While a balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates, and fats is essential, high protein intake is crucial. Those who struggle to gain weight often have a high metabolic rate, which leads to faster muscle breakdown. Protein sources such as sirloin, blue fish, egg whites, and milk are recommended. Increasing your food intake drastically is unnecessary, but gradually growing your meal size is necessary.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Suspected Zinc Deficiency</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pu4GQ_underweight_why_it_might_be_worse_than_obesity_for_your_health.jpg" alt="Underweight? Why It Might Be Worse Than Obesity for Your Health"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Vitamin B1 and zinc deficiency can also cause a loss of appetite. Vitamin B1 can be supplemented with sunflower seeds or peanuts, while zinc can be consumed through egg yolks, beans, brown rice, oysters, and beef. Nicotine can suppress appetite and increase energy levels, so quitting smoking is also essential.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s Healthy to Be Underweight If You Have Enough Muscle</h2><p>It’s harmful to force your weight to reach an average level if you maintain a regular eating habit. Even if you are underweight but have enough muscle mass and no chronic diseases, you do not need to force yourself to gain weight. These individuals typically have a high basal metabolic rate and burn more energy during rest.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What If It’s Due to an Eating Disorder?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pu77d_underweight_why_it_might_be_worse_than_obesity_for_your_health.jpg" alt="Underweight? Why It Might Be Worse Than Obesity for Your Health"><figcaption><em>.

If being underweight is due to an eating disorder like anorexia, it can be treated. While it may take time to recover, improvement can be made gradually. If you suspect you have an eating disorder, it’s important to seek medical help, as early treatment can minimize the aftereffects.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Gain Weight Healthily</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pu77e_underweight_why_it_might_be_worse_than_obesity_for_your_health.jpg" alt="Underweight?

Starting a workout routine can help your body absorb and store more nutrients, aiding digestion, even if you eat the same amount. Also, skinny people tend to have irregular life patterns or bad habits such as excessive smoking and drinking. Prioritizing a regular sleep schedule and maintaining a healthy lifestyle should be your first step.</p></main>
