    <main><h1>What to Really Get Someone Going through a Health Journey (aka a Cancer Diagnosis)</h1><h2>Blow Out</h2><p>One gift you can give someone undergoing treatment during their health journey is a trip to the salon for a blowout after their surgery or treatment has ended. “A blowout could be especially appreciated after surgery and multiple days spent in a hospital especially as one gets visitors once they are home,” says Erica Sukay, a colon cancer survivor. Whether you book a trip to the salon or a house call, consider giving the gift of a fresh new do—even if they just want a gentle shampoo, condition, and style.</p><figure><img title="Blow Out" src="IMG/BB1hGqDU_blow_out.jpg" alt="Blow Out"><figcaption><em>Blow Out.

Whether they're cracking open a paperback or powering up a Kindle, your friends will appreciate this gift. Maybe even consider buying them some inspirational reads if they feel appropriate..</p><h2>Candy</h2><p>You may not think candy is the right gift for this moment, but for some people, basic medical upkeep, like flushing an implanted port, can sometimes cause a bad taste in their mouth. This happened to Sukay, which is why she recommends giving family and friends candy to enjoy during their appointments. One caveat though—please avoid their very favorite treat. “Do not choose their favorite candy because it may ruin it for them as they may then later associate it with treatment,” says Sukay.</p><h2>Cleaning Service</h2><p>Now this is a gift anyone would love, but especially if you are overwhelmed with working on your health with treatment and recovery. Whether the cleaning staff come in once a week, every other week, or once a month, having a clean home is always an uplifting feeling that can help put loved ones in brighter spirits.</p><h2>Countdown Board</h2><p>If your loved one is going through treatment, like the brutal process of chemotherapy, and has a certain amount of sessions left, consider getting them a countdown board. This gift shows your friend physically how much more of their treatment they have left. This can be a good reminder of how far they have come in their journey and that they truly are superheroes.</p><h2>Religious Book or Gift</h2><p>When going through a tough health struggle, many people turn to their faith for comfort. Whether they read the Bible, the Torah, the Quran, or something else, consider gifting your loved one something that may help them hold tight to their faith during this season of life. There are also plenty of spiritual self-help books they might get something from.</p><h2>Food Delivery Gift Cards</h2><p>You may be hesitant to buy a gift card, but this is an instance where the recipient will truly thank you for them. The last thing most people undergoing a health journey want to worry about every night is food—let alone cooking it. This is when a gift card is a very (very) good gift idea. Plus, they can choose what sounds good for them that night as their appetite and cravings for certain foods may be impacted by certain treatments.</p><h2>Greeting Card</h2><p>Another simple yet thoughtful gift is a greeting card. Though it may be small, some people may only be able to make a trip to their mailbox once a day or maybe even once every few days depending on how they are feeling. Even if you live in the same city, send them something heartfelt, silly, or anything in between to help bring a smile to their face.</p><figure><img title="Greeting Card" src="IMG/BB1hGeV8_greeting_card.jpg" alt="Greeting Card"><figcaption><em>Greeting Card. fotostorm - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Hair Care Products</h2><p>If family or friends are worried about regrowing hair, consider gifting them hair care products, especially ones that can help kick-start their hair growth. Just make sure the brands they want are doctor-approved before you buy them.</p><figure><img title="Hair Care Products" src="IMG/BB1hGcQu_hair_care_products.jpg" alt="Hair Care Products"><figcaption><em>Hair Care Products.

Although your loved ones may still be able to be active (with a doctor’s clearance), they may need to take it down a notch. A great gift idea would be to a health or wellness studio that offers low-impact or slow-flow classes. Think of things like gentle restorative yoga, a light stretching class, or meditation classes. This way, your loved ones can still have something to look forward to that keeps them active even if it's different from what they were accustomed to.</p><h2>Infrared Recovery Items</h2><p>A uniquely fun gift would be to give loved ones infrared recovery devices. “Some people gifted me infrared therapy gifts like an infrared blanket and a FlexBeam,” shares Sukay. “Those items help with things like pain relief and inflammation as well as things like workout performance so they are great gifts for both during and after treatment.” Always make sure to clear usage with your doctors before use with any new device while undergoing treatment.</p><h2>Manicure or Pedicure</h2><p>A mani-pedi is a great group activity and will help your ill friend feel better in a small way during this tough time. Most people love to feel pampered and feel better with well-kept paws and claws, so book them a nail appointment or have a technician provide an at-home manicure or pedicure if your loved one is staying close to home during recovery or treatment.</p><h2>Motivational Quotes</h2><p>It may be a cliche, but if there is a Bible verse, motivational quote, or saying that is inspiring to your loved one, consider having it put on a sign or framed so they can see it every day on their health journey. These items can be really good reminders that are especially helpful on the hard days.</p><h2>Nausea Band</h2><p>Most people in your life would thank you for this nausea band, but it can provide a lot of relief if you're unwell. Sukay’s parents gifted her this one and she said that it helped with her feelings and waves of nausea when they hit during treatment sessions.</p><figure><img title="Nausea Band" src="IMG/BB1hGqEr_nausea_band.jpg" alt="Nausea Band"><figcaption><em>Nausea Band.

Sukay says, “One of my friends who also is a breast cancer survivor told me that when you first get diagnosed everyone will be there for you, but just as with anything in life, as time passes, people may forget that you need them just as much later in the journey as you needed them at the start.” Simply staying in touch consistently will mean so much. Ask if they need anything, check in on their progress, and let them know you are thinking of them and be there to listen if needed.</p><h2>Regular Items They Love</h2><p>This gift may sound so simple, but just remember what your loved ones' favorite gifts are in the first place. “I love workout outfits so getting something like a new pair of leggings would not only excite me, but also would make me feel normal and give me something to look forward to wearing in a future class when I was able to return,” says Sukay. Maybe your family member loves their cozy slippers or fuzzy socks— or your best friend collects soft sweatpants. Don't overthink it, the classics will always be appreciated!</p><h2>Small Photos of Family and Friends</h2><p>If you cannot attend a treatment session with your loved one, consider gifting them small photos of their family and friends. “My friends got me a small picture of them to take with me to treatment, which I liked the portability of and thought it was sweet,” shares Sukay.</p><h2>Waxing Service</h2><p>Depending on their treatment or how someone feels about having hair, a wax could be a great gift. Although some people may want to keep as much hair as possible, others may enjoy their monthly waxes, which help them feel more like themselves. Whether you book an eyebrow wax, legs, or underarms, little things like that can make someone feel good about themselves.</p></main>
