Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Losing weight can be a challenge, and with all the advice online and on social media, it can seem like everyone has a different opinion on the “best” way to do it. But the most effective way to see a noticeable change on the scale is through the tried-and-true combination of diet and exercise.</p><p>Aerobic exercise, also called cardiovascular exercise (cardio, for short), can help you lose weight and improve your overall health. It involves any activity that gets you breathing harder and elevates your heart rate. Read on to learn more about how cardio can help you meet your goals, which type of cardio is best for you, and how to incorporate this type of exercise into your routine.</p><h2>How Does Cardio Help You Lose Weight?</h2><p>Cardio exercise can help you lose weight by burning calories, which can lead to a caloric deficit, says Michelle Routhenstein, RD, CDCES, a New York City–based preventive cardiology dietitian at Entirely Nourished.</p><p>You achieve a caloric deficit when you eat fewer calories than you burn, according to the Cleveland Clinic. This requires reducing the number of calories you consume from food and drinks or combining caloric reduction with exercise.</p><p>A caloric deficit is essential for weight loss, and calculating a caloric deficit is individual to each person. To determine your daily caloric needs and how a deficit can help you achieve your weight loss goals, speak with your doctor or a dietitian.</p><h2>Is Cardio Better Than Strength Training for Weight Loss?</h2><p>Both cardio and strength training (also called resistance training) can contribute to weight loss, but they have different effects on the body. “Cardio may burn more calories during the activity, while strength training builds muscle, which can boost metabolism and aid in long-term weight management,” Routhenstein says.</p><p>You can lose weight with one or the other type of exercise, but typically integrating both into a workout plan leads to the best results, notes Max Fitzgerald, MD, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist and co-director of the RUSH Center for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Oak Park, Illinois.</p><p>“Any activity, whether it be walking or running or weight lifting, can lead to weight loss through a calorie deficit, but those that combine elevated heart rates and multi-group muscle engagement with resistance activities are most likely to lead to fat loss,” he says. “The main reason for this is the muscles break down fat for energy, and that directly affects basal metabolic rate.”</p><h2>Which Type of Cardio Is Best for Weight Loss?</h2><p>Despite what some influencers may want you to believe, no magic exercise routine can guarantee the pounds will melt away.</p><p>“The type of cardio to help with weight loss is the one that can fit consistently in your schedule and that is appropriate based on your exercise level and capacity,” Routhenstein says.</p><p>For example, while high-intensity interval training offers greater intensity and the potential for increased calorie burn, it may not be for everyone and may even be counterproductive for some.</p><p>“Individuals with joint issues or a sedentary lifestyle might find it too demanding to sustain, increasing the risk of injuries that could disrupt the consistency of regular exercise,” Routhenstein says.</p><p>She also notes that no specific type of cardio exclusively targets belly fat. “However, consistent cardio combined with a healthy diet can lead to overall fat loss, including in the abdominal area,” she says.</p><h2>Which Cardio Machines Are Most Effective?</h2><p>Just as no one-size-fits-all cardio routine will guarantee weight loss, no particular cardio machine is more effective than another.</p><p>“The effectiveness of cardio machines depends on personal preference, fitness level, and any existing injuries or limitations,” Routhenstein says. “Treadmills, elliptical trainers, and stationary bikes are popular options, but the best machine is one you enjoy and use consistently.”</p><p>Importantly, certain cardio machines — or methods of using them — aren’t advised for everyone.</p><p>“You can get a good workout with almost any machine at the gym, but it should be tailored to your abilities,” Dr. Fitzgerald says. “I do not regularly recommend running on a treadmill for people with knee or hip problems. Instead, I suggest they walk briskly and increase the incline.”</p><p>If you already have a consistent exercise routine, Routhenstein recommends adding a cardio machine that can help you enhance your exercise by adding a challenging element. “For instance, increasing intensity, duration, or speed, provided that you have no medical restrictions,” she says.</p><h2>How Much Cardio Do You Need for Weight Loss?</h2><p>The amount of cardio needed for weight loss will vary depending on a number of factors like current weight, fitness level, and individual goals, Routhenstein says.</p><p>A general guideline is to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly, along with strength training two or more days per week.</p><p>If you’re choosing a moderate-intensity cardio activity like brisk walking, an easy way to meet this requirement is to break it up into five 30-minute sessions per week.</p><p>But remember, exercise is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to weight loss.</p><p>“Ultimately, exercise should be one part of a weight loss strategy, with nutrition, sleep, and stress management also playing important roles,” Fitzgerald says. “Every effort counts, and people should celebrate whatever they can fit into their busy routines. The most important thing to keep in mind is the calorie deficit, so a week with less activity or exercise should be a week focused on good eating.”</p><h2>What Are Some Low-Impact Cardio Options for Beginners?</h2><p>Let’s face it: Certain cardio activities like running or hiking up a mountain can be intimidating. But the good news is you can reap the same benefits of cardio exercise by doing low-impact aerobic activities. For example, 30 minutes on a stationary bike cycling at a moderate pace burns the same amount of calories as high-impact aerobics, according to Harvard Health.</p><p>What’s more, in a study where researchers analyzed 33,060 runners and 15,045 walkers, both groups experienced similar benefits in overall health, including a reduced risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol over a six-year follow-up.</p><p>If you’re new to working out and would like to get started with low-impact cardio options, consider the following:</p><ul>  <li>Walking</li>  <li>Cycling</li>  <li>Swimming</li>  <li>Water aerobics</li>  <li>Doubles tennis</li>  <li>Dancing</li>  <li>Gardening</li>  <li>Elliptical machine</li>  <li>Rowing machine</li>  <li>Stair climbing</li>  <li>Yoga</li> </ul><h2>Can You Lose Weight Without Cardio?</h2><p>If you despise cardio exercise, know that it is possible to lose weight without it.</p><p>“While cardio can accelerate weight loss, it’s not strictly necessary,” Routhenstein says. “Weight loss primarily comes down to maintaining a calorie deficit, which can be achieved through diet alone or a combination of diet and other forms of exercise, such as strength training.”</p><p>However, remember that beyond weight loss, cardio provides numerous health benefits, so it’s a good idea to incorporate it into your routine for overall health. Research shows cardiovascular exercise reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and respiratory disease. Studies also suggest it boosts psychological well-being and improves quality of life.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Incorporating cardio exercise into your routine is an excellent strategy to reach your weight loss goals. However, just remember that physical activity — in all its forms — is only one piece of the puzzle to achieving a healthy weight. A healthy diet, caloric deficit, sleep, and stress management, along with exercise, are all important components of a weight loss plan.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
