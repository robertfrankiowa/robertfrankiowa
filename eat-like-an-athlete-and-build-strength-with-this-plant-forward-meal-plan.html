    <main><h1>Eat like an athlete and build strength with this plant-forward meal plan</h1><p>For the first time, the monthly Start TODAY challenge has a coinciding meal plan! As we prepare for the Summer Olympics, this month’s challenge asks you to eat like an athlete. </p><p>Whether you walk daily, enjoy spin class, run marathons or are beginning your fitness routine, this meal plan is for you. The simple plant-forward meals will help you eat like the Olympic athletes in Paris. Since the Olympic games are prioritizing vegetarian options this year, this meal plan follows suit.</p><p>At least 50% of the meals this week are meatless, so you'll get more fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants on your plate. Plus, the pre-workout and post-workout snacks will energize you for a workout and aid in muscle growth. </p><p>And make sure you check out 3 simple nutrition tips to help you eat like an athlete. </p><h2>What to Eat This Week, July 1, 2024</h2><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1p4mPT_start_today_meal_plan_july_1_2024.jpg" alt="Start Today meal plan July 1, 2024"><figcaption><em>Start Today meal plan July 1, 2024. </em></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>></em></strong><strong><em>>Download and print the meal plan</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>>></em></strong><strong><em>Get a 31-day walking and upper body strength workout</em></strong></p><h2>Monday</h2><p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>Dylan’s Favorite Green Pancakes </p><p><strong>Lunch: </strong>Black Bean Quesadillas</p><p><strong>Dinner: </strong>Sheet Pan Masala-Spiced Veggie Bowl</p><p>Snack of choice</p><h2>Tuesday</h2><p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>Chocolate-Banana Overnight Oatmeal</p><p><strong>Lunch: </strong>Healthy Greek Pasta Salad</p><p><strong>Dinner: </strong>Grilled Summer Vegetable Pasta</p><p>Snack of choice</p><h2>Wednesday</h2><p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>Dylan’s Favorite Green Pancakes </p><p><strong>Lunch: </strong>Black Bean Quesadillas</p><p><strong>Dinner: </strong>Grilled Coconut Shrimp with Midsummer Tomato-Melon Salad</p><p>Snack of choice</p><h2>Thursday</h2><p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>Chocolate-Banana Overnight Oatmeal</p><p><strong>Lunch: </strong>Leftovers</p><p><strong>Dinner: </strong>Joy Bauer’s Peach Caprese Burgers</p><p>Snack of choice</p><h2>Friday</h2><p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>Dylan’s Favorite Green Pancakes </p><p><strong>Lunch: </strong>Healthy Greek Pasta Salad</p><p><strong>Dinner: </strong>Chipotle-Pineapple Tofu Skewers Recipe with corn on the cob</p><p>Snack of choice</p><h2>Breakfast</h2><p>We’ve all heard the saying “breakfast is the most important meal of the day”. For athletes, that couldn’t be more true. Eating a well-balanced breakfast jumpstarts all the systems in your body to give you energy for exercise. </p><p>Dylan's Favorite Green Pancakes by Dylan Dreyer</p><p>These pancakes have plenty of carbs to provide energy, but they are also packed with fruits and veggies, like bananas and spinach. They are the ultimate balanced pre-workout breakfast to fill you up without weighing you down. Eat these 1-2 hours before a workout to feel satiated.</p><p>Chocolate-Banana Overnight Oatmeal by Joy Bauer</p><p>This simple recipe mixes two delicious flavors–chocolate and banana. And the best part is that it’s a prep-ahead meal, so you can grab it from the fridge and go. Plus, oats are chock-full of carbs and fiber to provide energy and keep you regular. Again, eat these 1-2 hours pre-workout for maximum energy. </p><h2>Lunch</h2><p>The mid-day meal serves as post-workout recovery or fuel for the rest of your day. Eating something with carbs, protein and fat keeps you full and energized until it’s time for a healthy snack. These options are quick, easy to throw together and full of plant-based deliciousness. </p><p>Black Bean Quesadillas by Kevin Curry</p><p>What could be better than a quick and hearty quesadilla with black beans and avocado? Black beans are a plant-based protein with iron that delivers oxygen to working muscles. Protein aids in muscle repair after a workout. However, black beans make some people gassy, so be aware of how your body reacts to this food if you plan to exercise later in the day. </p><p>Greek Pasta Salad by Kevin Curry</p><p>Everyone loves a Greek salad, and this version is served on a bed of chewy orzo pasta. This meal is so easy to meal prep and eat all week. I suggest adding some sort of protein, like chickpeas, salmon, tuna or chicken, which will keep you full long after eating. </p><h2>Dinner</h2><p>Dinner should be quick, easy, tasty and nutritious. It’s not always easy to check all those boxes, but I’m confident these meals fit the bill. These meals also embrace summer ingredients, like peaches, tomatoes and pineapple, and methods of cooking, like the grill. </p><p>Sheet Pan Masala-Spiced Veggie Bowl by Samah Dada</p><p>Start the week simply with a vegetarian sheet-pan meal. This bowl has plenty of protein from the chickpeas and carbs from the veggies and rice. And it tastes great. It’s the perfect end to your day to set you up for success tomorrow. </p><p>Grilled Summer Vegetable Pasta  by Casey Barber</p><p>Pairing pasta with grilled summer veggies like corn and green beans, creates a well-balanced and tasty meal that the whole family can enjoy. </p><p>Grilled Coconut Shrimp with Midsummer Tomato-Melon Salad by Marcus Samuelsson</p><p>This recipe screams summer, with a coconut-marinated grilled shrimp and a fresh tomato salad. It’s easy to make in 30-minutes or less, and it’s not overly filling. </p><p>Peach Caprese Burgers by Joy Bauer</p><p>Today’s meal is great for a 4th of July BBQ. Swap out ground beef for turkey and top your burger with seasonal peaches, fresh mozzarella and a balsamic glaze. This burger shows you don’t have to sacrifice meat to eat more plants. </p><p>Chipotle-Pineapple Tofu Skewers by Karlee Rotoly</p><p>Another simple grilled recipe, these tasty pineapple-marinated tofu skewers will make you forget about meat for a night. They are yummy and filling. Pair them with summer veggies, like corn on the cob, for a complete meal. </p><h2>Snacks</h2><p>Snacks prevent you from experiencing extreme hunger. I’ve provided two types of snacks that play a role in energy levels and muscle growth. </p><h3>Pre-workout snacks</h3><p>These snacks emphasize carbohydrates, which are the main fuel source for exercise. Eat these 60 minutes before a workout to feel that extra burst of energy. Maybe you’ll be able to even workout a little longer with more gas in the tank. </p><ul><li>Nut-Free Granola Bars Recipe</li><li>Natalie Morales’ Homemade Coconut Granola Recipe</li><li>Energizing Trail Mix</li></ul><p>Eat these snacks right after a workout to prevent fatigue and repair tired muscles. The protein in these snacks will help you grow stronger and promote muscle growth. </p></main>
