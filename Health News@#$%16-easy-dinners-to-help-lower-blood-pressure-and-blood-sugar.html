Each of these delicious recipes helps support heart health, as they're packed with potassium and contain lower amounts of saturated fats and sodium. Additionally, these dinners feature complex carbs like whole grains and veggies to meet our diabetes-friendly nutrition parameters. Recipes like our Sheet-Pan Chili-Lime Salmon with Potatoes & Peppers and our Spicy Orange Beef & Broccoli Stir-Fry are great choices for an easy, flavorful and nutritious meal at the end of the day.</p><h2>Chipotle Chicken Quinoa Burrito Bowl</h2><p>This flavorful burrito bowl features grilled chicken coated in a spicy chipotle glaze.

Melted Swiss cheese, sliced tomato and arugula top off this delicious low-carb dinner!</p><h2>No-Cook Black Bean Salad</h2><p>The dressing for this vegan black bean salad gets its creaminess from blended avocado. Any mix of salad greens will work well, but try arugula if you want to give this hearty salad a peppery kick.</p><h2>Cheeseburger Stuffed Baked Potatoes</h2><p>Skip the bun and serve all of your favorite cheeseburger ingredients--beef, cheese, tomatoes, red onions and lettuce--with baked potatoes for a hearty and easy dinner recipe that kids and adults will love.
