    <main><h1>Risk Factors & Early Warning Signs of Chronic Kidney Disease</h1><h2>Major Risks</h2><p>There are several factors that increase the risk of developing Chronic Kidney Disease. Diabetes plays a role for sure, with about 1 in 3 adults with diabetes also having CKD. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, making them unable to function properly. High blood pressure affects about 1 in every 5 adults with CKD, as it can also damage blood vessels in the kidneys. "High blood pressure can make blood vessels narrower, reducing blood flow. Over time, blood vessels throughout the body weaken, including in the kidneys," warns the CDC.</p><p>Heart disease is another factor to consider. Adults with heart failure have a higher risk of Chronic Kidney Disease due to an overall reduced blood flow to the kidneys. Additionally, obesity raises the risk for diabetes and high blood pressure, and any family history of CKD, smoking, and being over the age of 60 are all good reasons to get tested.</p><figure><img title="Major Risks" src="IMG/BB1ngi4N_major_risks.jpg" alt="Major Risks"><figcaption><em>Major Risks.

These tests measure creatinine levels in the blood and the presence of protein in the urine, both indicators of kidney health. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms do start to become noticeable. The National Kidney Foundation states that “<em>people living with CKD do not have any symptoms until the more advanced stages and/or complications develop. If symptoms do happen, they may include foamy urine, urinating more often or less often than usual"</em>. </p><p>Other symptoms include persistent fatigue, itchy and dry skin, nausea, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss. Advanced stages of CKD might cause more severe symptoms like difficulty concentrating, numbness or swelling in the extremities, muscle cramps, shortness of breath, vomiting, and trouble sleeping. </p><figure><img title="Early Warning Signs and Symptoms" src="IMG/BB1ngdrt_early_warning_signs_and_symptoms.jpg" alt="Early Warning Signs and Symptoms"><figcaption><em>Early Warning Signs and Symptoms.

Aim for a blood pressure reading below 140/90 mm Hg and keeping your blood sugar levels within target ranges. Regular physical activity, having a balanced diet, and managing your weight all play important roles in preventing CKD progression.</p><p>In cases where progress happens despite these measures, medical interventions might include medication, dialysis, or even a kidney transplant if the disease has progressed too far.</p><figure><img title="Preventive Measures and Treatment" src="IMG/BB1ngkBY_preventive_measures_and_treatment.jpg" alt="Preventive Measures and Treatment"><figcaption><em>Preventive Measures and Treatment.

Knowing the risks, early symptoms, and preventive startegies should help you manage CKD effectively. Be proactive to help slow anyn progress and you'll be able to improve the quality of life you and those around you those.</p></main>
