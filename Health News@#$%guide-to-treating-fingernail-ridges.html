    <main><h1>Guide To Treating Fingernail Ridges</h1><h2>Take Vitamin Supplements</h2><p>Patients who have fingernail ridges caused by iron deficiency anemia or by deficiencies in folic acid or other nutrients are typically advised to take vitamin supplements as the first line of treatment. Doctors may recommend that patients use a particular type of over-the-counter supplement, and high doses of some vitamins and minerals might be provided as a prescription. Individuals treating their fingernail ridges with vitamin supplements may be asked to have follow-up appointments for blood tests. Repeat blood tests allow doctors to monitor the patient's nutrient levels and determine when these values have returned to the normal range. In addition to supplements, patients might wish to obtain some of their vitamins and minerals through food. Nutritionists and clinicians can recommend foods that are good sources of the specific nutrients in which the patient is deficient. For example, patients deficient in iron could choose to add a fortified cereal to their diet, and individuals deficient in protein may wish to include more soy and green vegetables in their daily intake. Patients taking supplements should never exceed the recommended dose, and they should ask their doctor about potential side effects from supplements before using these.</p><p>Keep reading to learn more about treating fingernail ridges now.</p><figure><img title="Take Vitamin Supplements" src="IMG/BB1lVm2X_take_vitamin_supplements.jpg" alt="Take Vitamin Supplements"><figcaption><em>Take Vitamin Supplements.

Patients who notice fingernail ridges might want to have their blood glucose readings checked. To prevent and treat diabetes, it is crucial that patients control blood sugar levels and keep these within the range their doctor recommends. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains helps many diabetes patients achieve better blood sugar control, and avoiding fried food, added sugar, and fast food is especially important. Patients should check their blood sugar at home every day, and doctors might need to do periodic glucose testing at a clinic too. Oral medications, injections, and insulin may be considered for diabetes patients who struggle with blood sugar control. Some patients have noticed a reduction in fingernail ridges when their blood glucose is well controlled. Patients with diabetes will normally be treated by an endocrinologist, and they may also see nutritionists as well.</p><p>Discover additional treatments for fingernail ridges now.</p><figure><img title="Control Blood Sugar" src="IMG/BB1pGthD_control_blood_sugar.jpg" alt="Control Blood Sugar"><figcaption><em>Control Blood Sugar.

Ointments help increase the moisture available to the nails, and they can prevent the nails from drying out. Since ridges often appear more pronounced when the nails and cuticles are dry, ointments help minimize the ridges. Many types of ointments are available over-the-counter, and patients might wish to try several to determine which ones work best for their needs. When using any over-the-counter product, individuals should always read the leaflet that comes with it, and they should take care to apply only the recommended amount of ointment. If a patient notices an ointment is not working, they might need to consult with their primary care doctor to be evaluated for potential underlying causes of fingernail ridges. Any troublesome side effects that occur after using an ointment should be noted and mentioned to a physician.</p><p>Get more details on how to treat fingernail ridges now.</p><figure><img title="Use Topical Ointments" src="IMG/BB1pGoQB_use_topical_ointments.jpg" alt="Use Topical Ointments"><figcaption><em>Use Topical Ointments.

An emery board files down the nails, and it is important to use this board gently. Care should be taken to avoid over-buffing the nails, as this could make them weaker and more prone to breakage or other damage. Intense buffing could also thin the nails, and it might introduce infection into the nail bed, leading to more serious issues. Individuals who wish to try buffing their nails at home should ensure they use clean emery boards each time, and they should stop immediately if any pain occurs. Having the nails buffed with an emery board at a nail salon is not recommended, as this may trigger infection, and nail technicians are not trained to treat fingernail ridges. Emery boards only hide the ridges; they do not treat the underlying cause. Prior to buffing their nails, patients may wish to have their nail ridges examined by a doctor just to make sure using an emery board is safe for their needs.</p><p>Learn more about treating fingernail ridges effectively now.</p><figure><img title="Buff Fingernails With An Emery Board" src="IMG/BB1pGvhu_buff_fingernails_with_an_emery_board.jpg" alt="Buff Fingernails With An Emery Board"><figcaption><em>Buff Fingernails With An Emery Board.

Although dermatologists specialize in the skin, they are physicians and can also test patients for the potential underlying causes of fingernail ridges. Dermatologists will examine the fingernails (and possibly the toenails), and they may also perform blood tests to check for nutritional deficiencies and measure the function of various organs. Depending on the underlying cause of the ridges, the dermatologist might prescribe medicated creams or recommend dietary changes for the patient, and they could also prescribe medication to improve thyroid function if this is impaired. If tests reveal a patient's fingernail ridges might be associated with diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular issues, a referral to another specialist will be made. The dermatologist might ask the patient to attend follow-up appointments so any existing ridges can be monitored.</p></main>
