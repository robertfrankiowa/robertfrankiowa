But there’s more to good digestion than just eating your veggies. There are lots of little tricks that can make a big difference in how well your digestive system works. Let’s explore some lesser-known tips that can help keep your gut running smoothly. Here are 13 little-known tips for better digestive health.</p><figure><img title="13 Little Known Tips for Better Digestive Health" src="IMG/BB1pGdis_13_little_known_tips_for_better_digestive_health.jpg" alt="13 Little Known Tips for Better Digestive Health"><figcaption><em>13 Little Known Tips for Better Digestive Health.

Chewing more helps break down your food before it reaches your stomach, making digestion easier. Try to chew each bite at least 20-30 times. This simple habit can reduce bloating and help you absorb more nutrients from your food.</p><h2>Eat Fermented Foods</h2><p>Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut are full of good bacteria that help your gut. These foods can improve your digestion and boost your immune system. Try to include a small serving of fermented foods in your diet every day. Your gut will thank you for the extra help!</p><h2>Stay Hydrated Between Meals</h2><p>Drinking water between meals, rather than with meals, can help your digestion. Too much liquid with meals can dilute your stomach acid, making it harder to break down food. Aim to drink most of your water about 30 minutes before or after eating. This gives your stomach the best chance to do its job.</p><h2>Try Eating Upside-Down</h2><p>This doesn’t mean standing on your head! It means eating your biggest meal earlier in the day. Your digestive system works best in the morning and early afternoon. Try having your largest meal at lunch instead of dinner. This can help reduce indigestion and improve your sleep.</p><h2>Use Herbs and Spices</h2><p>Many herbs and spices can help with digestion. Ginger, peppermint, and fennel are especially good for soothing upset stomachs. Try adding these to your meals or drinking them as teas. They can help reduce bloating and gas while adding flavor to your food.</p><h2>Practice Mindful Eating</h2><p>Eating while distracted can lead to poor digestion. Try to focus on your food while you’re eating. Turn off the TV, put away your phone, and really pay attention to your meal. This can help you eat more slowly and enjoy your food more, which is better for digestion.</p><h2>Take a Short Walk After Meals</h2><p>A gentle walk after eating can help move food through your digestive system. Just 10-15 minutes of walking can make a big difference. It doesn’t have to be a power walk – a leisurely stroll is perfect. This habit can help reduce bloating and improve digestion.</p><figure><img title="Take a Short Walk After Meals" src="IMG/BB1p00zc_take_a_short_walk_after_meals.jpg" alt="Take a Short Walk After Meals"><figcaption><em>Take a Short Walk After Meals.

Lying down too soon can lead to acid reflux and indigestion. If you eat dinner late, try to finish at least 3 hours before bedtime. This gives your body time to digest before you lie down to sleep.</p><h2>Eat More Fiber, But Slowly</h2><p>Fiber is great for digestion, but adding too much too quickly can cause gas and bloating. Increase your fiber intake gradually over a few weeks. This gives your gut time to adjust. Remember to drink plenty of water as you increase your fiber intake to help things move smoothly.</p><figure><img title="Eat More Fiber, But Slowly" src="IMG/BB1oan88_eat_more_fiber_but_slowly.jpg" alt="Eat More Fiber, But Slowly"><figcaption><em>Eat More Fiber, But Slowly.

Try this for a few minutes after meals or when you’re feeling bloated. It’s a simple and soothing way to support your digestion.</p><h2>Reduce Stress</h2><p>Stress can have a big impact on your digestion. Find ways to relax and manage stress, like deep breathing, yoga, or meditation. Even a few minutes of relaxation each day can make a difference to your digestive health.</p><h2>Eat Prebiotic Foods</h2><p>Prebiotics are foods that feed the good bacteria in your gut. Foods like garlic, onions, bananas, and asparagus are great prebiotics. Include these in your diet to help your good gut bacteria thrive. Happy gut bacteria mean better digestion for you!</p><figure><img title="Eat Prebiotic Foods" src="IMG/BB1oJJEN_eat_prebiotic_foods.jpg" alt="Eat Prebiotic Foods"><figcaption><em>Eat Prebiotic Foods.

Some foods might not agree with you, even if they’re healthy. Everyone’s digestive system is different, so it’s important to figure out what works best for your body.</p><p>Remember, good digestive health is about more than just what you eat. These tips can help you get the most out of your meals and keep your digestive system running smoothly. Try incorporating a few of these habits into your routine and see how much better you feel!</p><h2>13 Things You’re Doing Wrong Every Day</h2><p>13 Things You’re Doing Wrong Every Day</p></main>
