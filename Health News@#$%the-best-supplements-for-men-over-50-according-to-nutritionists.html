    <main><h1>The Best Supplements for Men Over 50, According to Nutritionists</h1><h2>Nature Made Calcium Magnesium Zinc with Vitamin D3</h2><p>While calcium is often stressed as an important nutrient for aging women, it’s equally important for men over age 50 to support bone health and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. While men are less likely to develop osteoporosis, it is possible and has been occurring more often in recent years in men over age 65. “Most men should aim for 1,000 - 1,200mg of calcium per day, which sometimes can be hard to meet with food alone,” says VanHuizen. Requirements increase from 1,000 milligrams daily to 1,200 once you reach age 70.<br>In addition to each tablet providing 32 percent of the DV for calcium, you’ll also get magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D3, minerals and vitamins that are crucial for supporting bone health. Magnesium is essential for bone health, heart rhythm, and energy production, and older adults are especially at risk of low levels, and 48 percent of all adults aren’t getting enough magnesium from food.</p><p>Taking the recommended 3 tablets a day provides 98 percent of your DV for magnesium. Zinc and vitamin D are also essential for bone health but have the added benefit for men over 50 by reducing the risk of erectile dysfunction, a condition commonly affecting men over age 40, affecting 20 to 40 percent of men between age 60 and 69.<br>With four essential nutrients in one pill, and the option to take one to three per day, depending on how healthful and varied your diet is, we love this Nature Made Calcium as one of the best overall options for men over 50.</p><figure><img title="Nature Made Calcium Magnesium Zinc with Vitamin D3" src="IMG/BB1pSWzl_nature_made_calcium_magnesium_zinc_with_vitamin_d3.jpg" alt="Nature Made Calcium Magnesium Zinc with Vitamin D3"><figcaption><em>Nature Made Calcium Magnesium Zinc with Vitamin D3. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Doctor's Best High Absorption CoQ10 with BioPerine</h2><p>Doctor’s Best CoQ10 with Bioperine has 200 milligrams of naturally produced antioxidants to help replenish falling levels as you age. As inflammation-related diseases increase with the aging process, supplementing with CoQ10 may help reduce this inflammation and help protect the liver and heart. “Studies suggest that CoQ10 may reduce blood pressure, support heart health, improve energy, and may even boost sperm quality,” says VenHuizen. </p><p>It may even help alleviate some of the symptoms of common medications that help prevent heart disease. As of 2018, 37 percent of all men over age 50 used statins, a drug that helps to lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. For this population, some studies have suggested that adding CoQ10 can reduce statin side effects, especially muscle pain associated with statin use, explains VenHuizen.<br>This particular formula includes black pepper extract, which contains the active ingredient piperine. A 2000 study found that supplementing 120 milligrams of CoQ10 with 5 milligrams of piperine increased the absorption of the CoQ10 by 30 percent. This combination makes it much more effective than a CoQ10 supplement on its own.</p><figure><img title="Doctor's Best High Absorption CoQ10 with BioPerine" src="IMG/BB1pSWzx_doctors_best_high_absorption_coq10_with_bioperine.jpg" alt="Doctor's Best High Absorption CoQ10 with BioPerine"><figcaption><em>Doctor's Best High Absorption CoQ10 with BioPerine. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Nature's Bounty B-12</h2><p>The quick-dissolve tablets for Nature’s Bounty vitamin B12 are held under your tongue and quickly dissolve for maximum absorption. “Sublingual vitamin B12 tablets may be easier to absorb, especially for those who have been on reflux medications,” says Pacheco. “Vitamin B12 is important for energy levels, red blood cell formation, and cognition, and a vitamin B12 deficiency can cause cognitive changes that can actually mimic dementia,” says Pacheco. </p><figure><img title="Nature's Bounty B-12" src="IMG/BB1pSUpF_natures_bounty_b_12.jpg" alt="Nature's Bounty B-12"><figcaption><em>Nature's Bounty B-12. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>THORNE Super EPA</h2><p>“One of my favorite Omega-3 supplements to help my clients meet their Omega-3 needs daily is Thorne’s Super EPA. Not only are Thorne’s products high quality and third-party verified, but just one capsule per day fully meets the Omega-3 needs for most men,” says VenHuizen.<br>As you age, the risk of heart disease becomes a major concern, and doing what you can to lower that risk can be lifesaving. The American Heart Association reports that the incidence of heart disease in adults increases from 40 percent from age 40 to 59 to 75 percent once you reach the ages of 60 to 79.</p><p>“Omega-3 fatty acids are incredible inflammatory-fighting nutrients that may reduce cardiovascular disease risk,” VanHuizen says. In addition, supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids may also help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and mood disorders like depression, which increase with aging.<br>Thorne’s Super EPA has 813 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids in each gelcap, which can help you get to the recommended 1,600 milligrams per day for men over 50 when taken twice per day.</p><figure><img title="THORNE Super EPA" src="IMG/BB1pSZ3p_thorne_super_epa.jpg" alt="THORNE Super EPA"><figcaption><em>THORNE Super EPA. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Men</h2><p>Garden of Life Once Daily Probiotics for Men includes 50 billion CFUs of 15 diverse strains of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria probiotics. Research over recent years has taught us the importance of a healthy gut microbiome, and its contribution to health extends even into the aging process. A healthy and diverse gut microbiome releases anti-inflammatory metabolites like short-chain fatty acids and other molecules that have a system-wide impact on inflammation. A healthy gut may have protective effects against diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, heart disease, and Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.<br>Taking one probiotic capsule daily can help you introduce and cultivate a healthy gut while the blend also includes 365 milligrams of prebiotic fibers to help support the growth of good bacteria in the colon. While they recommend storing this probiotic in a cool, dry place, it’s shelf-stable and does not require refrigeration, making it more convenient than many other probiotic options. </p><figure><img title="Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Men" src="IMG/BB1pSRY0_garden_of_life_dr_formulated_probiotics_for_men.jpg" alt="Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Men"><figcaption><em>Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics for Men. amazon.com</em></figcaption></figure><h2>NATURE'S CALLING All-Natural Fiber Supplement</h2><p>As you age, your fiber needs increase, but your appetite and diet may actually decrease, making it more difficult to get as much as you need. The 6 grams of fiber in Nature’s Calling Sunfiber comes from guar gum, which is a soluble fiber that’s easy to digest without causing excess bloating or gas. With this soluble fiber supplement, you’ll reap the benefits of feeding the good bacteria in your gut, supporting lower cholesterol levels, increasing feelings of fullness, and improving digestive symptoms like diarrhea or constipation.</p><p>If you struggle with IBS, Sunfiber is a great way to increase your fiber intake without increasing digestive upset as it’s a low FODMAP food. As a slow-digesting prebiotic, it helps to feed the good bacteria in your digestive tract, releasing short-chain fatty acids and other helpful metabolites that reduce inflammation and support your whole body's health. Just mix one scoop of this flavorless powder into a glass of water or other beverage for 6 grams of soluble, prebiotic fibers, getting you 21 percent of the way to your daily fiber goals.</p></main>
