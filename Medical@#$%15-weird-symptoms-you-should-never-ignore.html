    <main><h1>15 Weird Symptoms You Should NEVER Ignore</h1><h2>1. Sore Jaw</h2><p>The jaw is actually close to the heart, and even in the absence of chest pain, sudden jaw pain may indicate a heart blockage. Especially if accompanied by any shortness of breath or pain in and around the heart area, this can be a telltale sign of heart issues that need to be addressed by a doctor immediately.</p><h2>2. Swollen Ankles</h2><p>Doctors often examine the ankles for swelling to get insight into how the kidneys are functioning. This is because decreased kidney function or kidney failure leads to the body retaining more sodium, which creates swelling, especially in the ankles and feet.</p><h2>3. Asthma</h2><p>Trouble breathing and tightness in the chest are symptoms of many things, including seasonal allergies and anxiety, but also more serious issues like heart attacks. If there is a blockage in the arteries, the entire chest area may be affected and manifest itself as a feeling of asthma.</p><h2>4. Frequent Urination</h2><p>Making a lot of trips to the bathroom could mean you are doing an excellent job of staying hydrated, but if it seems excessive, it could also indicate Type 2 diabetes. This happens because sugar builds up in the blood and your organs are working overtime to clean it all up, leading to a frequent need to keep things draining. For men, frequent urination can also mean prostate trouble.</p><h2>5. Hiccups That Won't Go Away</h2><p>Hiccups can be caused by a local disturbance, such as a tumor or cancerous cells in and around the throat. Persistent hiccups can also be a warning of problems in the brain, such as indicating a stroke.</p><figure><img title="5.

Oftentimes, it points to thyroid issues, specifically underactive thyroid. An underactive thyroid decreases the amount of energy you burn and sometimes your bodily temperature, making you feel chilly.</p><figure><img title="6.

Changes in Bowel Habits</h2><p>Even if you don't like talking about poop, it's an important indicator of health. Changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or blood/mucus in the stool, can indicate a number of underlying issues. Some of the most common culprits are irritable bowel syndrome, cancer, intestinal parasites, and anxiety.</p><h2>8. Sore Tongue</h2><p>A sore tongue can indicate a lack of vitamin B12, which can lead to anemia. Especially when accompanied by fatigue and weak or brittle nails, this is a classic sign that a body is deficient in this essential vitamin. A simple blood test can determine levels of B12, which can be replenished with a vitamin pill or through diet.</p><h2>9. Facial Hair and/or Pattern Baldness in Women</h2><p>These symptoms may be uncomfortable to bring up with a doctor, but they can help point to the cause, which can be Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This disease affects the endocrine system, which regulates hormones throughout the body, and can be present with or without cysts on the ovaries.</p><figure><img title="9.

Unquenchable Thirst</h2><p>Diabetes causes the blood to get overrun with insulin and/or sugar, depending on the type of diabetes. This forces the organs to work harder to bring balance back to the blood, and signals the body to eliminate waste more often, leading to a feeling of dehydration and never-ending thirst.</p><h2>11. Thinning Eyebrows</h2><p>This very specific symptom is a strong indicator of thyroid issues. When it comes to checking the thyroid, there are many different lab tests that can be done. If you notice thinning in your eyebrows, especially the outer edges, ask your doctor about possible thyroid issues.</p><h2>12. Tingling Hands and Feet</h2><p>Diabetes is known to cause nerve damage, which can manifest as either tingling or pain in the limbs. Most people experience tingling before pain, and a recurring tingling sensation in the hands and feet can help identify diabetes in people who are developing the disease.</p><h2>13. Loss of Taste</h2><p>Researchers still don't know exactly how Alzheimer's disease works, but we do know that it affects the brain, which controls the nervous system. One of the many unfortunate symptoms of the disease is a loss of taste, which can often occur in the beginning stages of the disease before other more obvious symptoms start to show.Â </p><h2>14. Itchy Skin</h2><figure><img title="14. Itchy Skin" src="IMG/AA1nckoa_14_itchy_skin.jpg" alt="14. Itchy Skin"><figcaption><em>14. Itchy Skin.

Blurred Vision</h2><p>Blurred vision is commonly associated with myopia, or nearsightedness, which is easily remedied with glasses or contact lenses. Parents may save money over the long term by having an ophthalmologist or optometrist identify impairments in children early. Research indicates that corrective measures can slow the progress of some vision disorders. Sudden blurring of vision can be cause for a hospital visit, as it's associated with more serious health issues like diabetes, stroke, and multiple sclerosis.</p><p><i>Stephen Johnson contributed to this report.</i></p></main>
