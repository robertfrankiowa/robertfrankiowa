I was so eager to see my baby after giving birth, I tried to walk to the recovery room before my epidural had fully worn off. Spoiler alert: I collapsed on the tiled floor. But even on the ground, I was ecstatic. After hours of labor, I had emerged victorious. It felt like my greatest accomplishment.</p><p>But the new-mom high was short-lived. My first attempts at breastfeeding were not so glorious, and when the unfriendly nurse on duty tried to “help” by grabbing my breast and shoving it into my son’s mouth, I started crying.</p><p>I didn’t really stop for the next two months.</p><h2>The Helplessness of Postpartum Depression</h2><p>I’ve struggled with depression my entire adult life, so I braced myself for the possibility of postpartum depression from the beginning. Most women experience the “baby blues” after delivery—mood swings, irritability, anxiety, sadness, and feeling overwhelmed—a therapist specializing in maternal mental health told me while I was pregnant, but if the blues lasted more than two weeks, it might be postpartum depression. I took note.</p><p>I made a mental health protection plan, monitoring my moods carefully, meditating frequently, and exercising regularly during pregnancy. Going into labor, I felt great.</p><p>After a smooth delivery and a standard 48-hour stay, we were discharged from the hospital. But I already knew in my gut that I wasn’t ready. As we were wheeling out to the parking lot, the scorching Miami sun suddenly felt unforgiving; tiny beads of sweat appeared on my nose, the humidity fogging my glasses. I held my baby, wrapped up in his layette set, to my chest. I was scared to put him in the car seat, so afraid that I’d break him. On the way home, I clutched his carseat on the verge of a panic attack, terrified we’d get into an accident.</p><p>The panic didn’t subside for months. Like all new parents, we documented all of the exciting firsts with our son—his first feeding, his first bath, his first diaper change. Often in these photos, I’m posing and smiling like I should be, but if you look closely, my eyes are pink and puffy and a stream of tears stains my cheeks. I really wanted to be present, but I felt myself starting to get lost.</p><h2>No Options</h2><p>Days of depression turned into weeks and then months. I felt as if someone had stuck a syringe into my enthusiasm to be a parent and sucked out every milliliter of joy and excitement until there was nothing left. I was empty.</p><p>My husband, being the supportive partner that he is, took on a large portion of the infant care and house work while I tried to tolerate just existing—a gargantuan task. Sometimes I lay in bed with an eye mask and headphones. Other times I would close the door, shut the lights off, and sit on the floor staring at a blank wall. I read articles about postpartum depression that left me feeling even more hopeless. I shut off communications with the outside world.</p><p>I became lost in the delusion that I was so incompetent as a mother that I was just getting in the way. I thought my family would be better off without me. I fantasized about packing a bag and flying to a far city and never coming back; I could send my family letters and maybe visit during the holidays. I needed to escape. I couldn’t tolerate what I was doing to my family. I couldn’t be the mom I had imagined myself being during the pregnancy. I felt like a failure. The negative thoughts became more insidious and blared on repeat in my mind, muting out any hope or happiness I had ever felt in the past.</p><p>Finally, one day a couple of months after my son was born, I hit rock bottom. During an early-morning feeding, I suddenly felt as if all the anxiety and depression was bubbling up in my chest. I tried to take a deep breath but I couldn’t. Panicked, I unlatched and handed the baby to my husband. I kept trying, but I just couldn’t catch my breath. I felt like I was going to die. Through tears I yelled at my husband that we needed to call 911.</p><p>When the paramedics arrived, they took my blood pressure and checked my heart rate, ruling that I was having a panic attack—I knew I needed help but I didn’t feel like I had any options.</p><h2>A Better Future for Moms With Depression</h2><p>When I was suffering with postpartum depression—as one in seven women do—less than a year ago, the options were extremely limited. I was proactive, seeking help from my therapist just weeks after my son was born. For years, antidepressants have been the best (and really only) treatment available for struggling moms, so when my psychiatrist recommended a low dose of medication to treat my depression, I gladly took his advice, doing everything my mental health team recommended in an attempt to stay afloat. I went to therapy every week, attended a postpartum therapy group, and worked with my psychiatrist to adjust my medication when needed. Still, my mood continued to decline.</p><p>Part of the problem is that antidepressants take <em>weeks</em> to start working. Instead of bonding with my son in those precious days, I found myself spiraling further and further into depression. I felt helpless.</p><p>Eventually I found relief. After the right combination of medications mingled in the corners of my brain, everything fell back into place quickly. Parenting was still hard, but it wasn’t an insurmountable challenge. I could laugh again. My husband went back to work, and I did things I couldn’t have fathomed during my lows. I managed to open and close the stroller by myself; I drove in the car with the baby on my own; while out, I changed a diaper without assistance. And I started writing again. But I still think about all the time I lost.</p><p>It hit me: If this treatment had been available last year, I could have avoided months of life-threatening symptoms. I’m privileged that my husband had paternity leave and could have cared for the baby while I checked in for an infusion, which I know won't be easy for many women who need the treatment. But because the symptoms of my depression put me at physical risk, staying in a safe and supported place for a few days would have comforted us both. The treatment would have been a lifesaver for us. My story has a happy ending, but not every case of postpartum depression does—suicide is a leading cause of death in perinatal women.</p><p>The thing I think most about now, months later, is time. How much time I lost trying to find the right treatment and waiting for it to work. How many firsts I missed as I fought through the early days of motherhood with puffy eyes and tear-stained cheeks. Women suffering with psychiatric problems are told just to be patient—but when you’re a new mother and you have a newborn depending on you, you just don’t have time for that. A drug that treats postpartum depression in 48 hours would have been a game changer—and I know it will be for women in the future. Everyone, mothers especially, deserve swift and effective mental health care. Maybe with these new treatments, the stigma of mental illness will finally fade.</p><p>When I learned that previous pregnancies make you more likely to have postpartum depression again, I was filled with dread. How could I begin to fathom going through that again? But now that I know Zulresso will be on the market, I feel like I have options, finally, for after my next baby. For now, I’m just grateful that I got the help I needed to get the chance to be the mom I always wanted to be.</p><p><em>Minhae Shim Roth is an essayist, journalist, and academic.
