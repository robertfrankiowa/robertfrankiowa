    <main><h1>Can't Afford Therapy? These Resources Can Help Your Mental Health</h1><p><em>This page may contain affiliate links.  As an Amazon affiliate, we may earn a small commission for any purchases made through these links. </em></p><p>In a world that moves at a breakneck pace, our mental health can take a hit. Although the importance of mental well-being is becoming less and less stigmatized, the barriers to accessing professional therapy remain higher than ever. Whether it's financial constraints, limited availability of therapists, or other logistical hurdles, the path to mental health care can sometimes feel like a journey that isn’t worth the hassle.</p><p>But, here's the reassuring truth: there are different avenues and resources available for those who find themselves unable to afford traditional therapy. From apps dedicated to promoting strong mental health to self-help books, there are many ways to look after your mental health other than simply with therapy. </p><p>We’ll walk you through some of these alternative options that you can explore, regardless of your financial situation. After all, we all deserve the chance to have a healthy mind! </p><h2>Self-Help And Education</h2><p>One of the first–and perhaps most obvious ways–that you can implement therapy alternatives into your life is by seeking out self-help and educational tools. I know what you may be thinking: “I’m not interested in reading a corny self-help book.” Luckily, educational books on mental health have come a long way from the titles of yore. </p><p>Now, you can find books that narrow in on any specific concerns that you may have surrounding your mental health. This makes educating yourself on topics that pertain to your mental health struggles much easier. Below is a list of some of our favorite self-help books right now. </p><h3>OUR SELECTIONS:</h3><h2>Maybe You Should Talk To Someone</h2><h3>LORI GOTTLIEB</h3><p><em>Maybe You Should Talk To Someone</em> is a therapist’s take on therapy.

Whether it helps you to focus on meditation, offers a platform to track your goals, or something else entirely, using an app is a great way to receive the support you need. </p><p>Although utilizing an app to better your mental health may seem a little suspicious, there are wonderful resources available on many apps on the market. We’ve detailed some of the best apps for specific mental health concerns below. </p><h2>Best For Stress Relief: Sanvello</h2><figure><img title="Provided by Swift Wellness" src="IMG/AA1msyKk_mental_health_apps___sanvello.jpg" alt="Mental Health Apps - Sanvello"><figcaption><em>Mental Health Apps - Sanvello.

I highly encourage you to look into the following:</p><h3>MOVEMENT</h3><p>Although exercise is not necessarily a fix-all solution, there is merit to finding movement that brings you joy. Whether you like walking, swimming, dancing, or another form of exercise, it can release endorphins, your brain’s feel-good hormones, causing a boost in mood. </p><h3>THERAPY/SUPPORT GROUPS</h3><p>Regardless of what you’re struggling with, there is a support group out there for you. By finding individuals who can relate to the issues that you’re facing, you’ll create a sense of community and recognize that you are not alone. </p><h3>PET THERAPY</h3><p>It’s been clinically proven that spending time around animals reduces your stress and anxiety levels and can boost your mood. If you don’t have a dog of your own, don’t worry! Many shelters look for volunteers to help take care of the animals. Additionally, consider looking for pet-sitting gigs. This gives you the benefit of companionship without a long-term commitment. </p><p>Sometimes, setting aside time in your day to dump your thoughts onto paper can turn your entire mood around. Journaling allows you to ‘speak’ your thoughts without fear of judgment or repercussions, and it’s a great resource to help track your progress on your mental health journey. </p><p>Start Journaling</p><figure><img title="Provided by Swift Wellness" src="IMG/AA1gexe2_journal_prompts_when_youre_feeling_down.jpg" alt="Journal Prompts: When You're Feeling Down"><figcaption><em>Journal Prompts: When You're Feeling Down. Provided by Swift Wellness</em></figcaption></figure><p>Journal Prompts: When You're Feeling Down</p><p>Journal Prompts: When You're Feeling Grateful</p><p>Remember, the path to healing is a personal one, and it's okay to experiment with different approaches until you find what resonates with you. The importance lies in acknowledging that your mental health matters and actively seeking the resources that align with your needs and circumstances.</p><p>Whatever stage of your mental health journey you find yourself at, we want you to know that you are never alone. The realization that therapy might be financially out of reach doesn't have to mark the end of your quest for support; rather, it opens the door to a world of alternative resources waiting to be explored. Life can feel incredibly overwhelming, but there are always options available to you.</p><p><em>If you are worried about yourself or a loved one, please call the National Mental Health Hotline at 988.</em> </p></main>
