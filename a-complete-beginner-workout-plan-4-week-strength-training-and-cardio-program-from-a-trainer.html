    <main><h1>A Complete Beginner Workout Plan: 4-Week Strength Training And Cardio Program, From A Trainer</h1><p>The hardest part of working out consistently? Getting started. Once you do, you start feeling (and soon, seeing) the effects on the mind, body, and soul. </p><p>No matter your age or experience, there are so many benefits to starting an exercise routine—increasing your metabolic rate by building muscle, stronger bones, ligaments, and tendons, improving blood pressure, and supporting your immune system, says Kristen McParland, CPT, NASM-certified personal trainer and certified nutrition coach with more than 10 years of experience. </p><p>But doing random workouts you see on TikTok or Instagram isn't necessarily the most efficient way to access all those perks. As a beginner or even a total pro, a comprehensive program helps you achieve your goals and takes out the guesswork. </p><p>Ahead, a complete beginner workout plan, including cardio and strength training, and expert answers to those burning exercise questions. Get ready to sweat smart.</p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Meet the experts:</strong> Kristen McParland, CPT, is a NASM-certified personal trainer and certified nutrition coach with more than 10 years of experience.</p><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>A Comprehensive Beginner Workout Plan: Strength And Cardio</strong></h3><p><em>Wherever your starting point, this beginner-friendly program, designed by McParland, will help you master those movement patterns and work your whole body for four weeks. </em></p><h3 class="body-h3"><strong>Week One</strong></h3><p>Complete the five programmed workouts when it's convenient for you. Focus on your form and take two solid rest days for recover. </p><p class="body-tip"><strong>Active rest days:</strong> Your activity on this day is up to you with the goal of some kind of motion on rest days. You could go for a long walk or hike lasting 40 minutes or more, or roll out your mat for a yoga class.</p><h3 class="body-h3">Week Two</h3><p class="body-text">If you hit all the workouts you wanted to during week one, repeat them during week two and increase one variable (reps or sets, weight, range of motion, slow down, reduce your rest periods) in each workout, McParland says. If you didn't hit your step goal, cardio, or missed a strength workout, don't stress. Refocus on completing all of the week one workouts before upping any of the above. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Week Three</h3><p>Repeat the workouts from week two exactly the same or increase one variable again. Option to add a third strength workout to level up. </p><h3 class="body-h3">Week Four</h3><p>Still going strong? Hit all six workouts and increase one variable during each one for extra challenge. Option to ramp up your cardio to 30 to 40 minutes or increase that step goal. </p><p class="body-h3"> <strong>Full-Body Strength I</strong></p><figure><img title="Women's Health" src="IMG/BB1jzFAs_beginner_fitness_final2jpg.jpg" alt="Beginner Fitness FINAL2.jpg"><figcaption><em>text.

The so-called "best time to work out" is dependent on what's best for you and your body, McParland says. Feel free to play with your schedule to see what works.</li><li><strong>Then, stick to your schedule. </strong>Add your workouts to your calendar like a meeting because it “helps you get into a routine,” McParland says. “You wouldn't just cancel last-minute with a client."</li><li><strong>Follow a program. </strong>It can be tough to know what exercises to do. McParland recommends choosing a guide, whether that’s the sample workout plan below, a program in a book or fitness app, or using a coach for even just a few weeks.</li><li><strong>Listen to your body. </strong>If you need a rest day, take it. If your body is craving more movement (cardio or strength training), add another day each week when you’re ready.</li><li><strong>Fuel properly. </strong>McParland recommends eating three meals a day and playing with your portions when you add on more gym days. Eating enough protein is important. “You'll have that energy that will reduce fatigue and help you to push hard,” she adds.</li><li><strong>Focus on yourself.</strong> "Don’t compare your journey or progress to anyone else, even beginners," McParland says. "Comparison is the thief of joy." Heard that!</li></ul><h2><strong>Best Cardio Workouts For Beginners</strong></h2><p>Perhaps your view of cardio is slogging away for hours on an elliptical or treadmill. Cardio actually includes a wide variety of aerobic exercise. “A lot of people have a bad relationship with cardio,” McParland explains. “But cardio is honestly a great supplement to strength training.”</p><p>A few of the benefits of cardio include better endurance in strength training, better blood pressure regulation, and higher VO2 max (the ability to take in more oxygen and deliver it to your muscles efficiently), she says.</p><p>You don't have to go all-in and train for a marathon—simply start at your own pace and build. Pick any form of cardio you enjoy and sprinkle it in two to three days a week for 20 to 30 minutes, McParland recommends. Then, take rest days in-between your cardio days.</p><p>Running indoors or out, biking or cycling, rowing, or using the elliptical or stair master are great cardio options, McParland recommends. No matter which form of cardio you choose, start out with interval training—try jogging or working for 30 seconds, then walking for a minute or two, and alternate that pattern for 20 minutes.</p><p>“Do something higher intensity, get your heart rate up, but then pull it back and recover,” she says. Eventually, you’ll be able to decrease the walk time and be able to keep up that higher intensity for 15 to 20 minutes without a break.</p><h2><strong>Best Strength Workouts For Beginners</strong></h2><p>First things first: Master the foundational movement patterns of strength training. These are the patterns you'll want to hit every week:</p><ul><li><strong>Push: </strong>any movement where you push something away from your body. Examples: pushups, bench presses, shoulder presses, and overhead presses.</li><li><strong>Pull: </strong>any movement where you pull something towards your body. Examples: chin-ups and bent-over rows.</li><li><strong>Squat: </strong>when you lower your hips and then stand back up. Examples: pulse squats, sumo squats, kettlebell squats.</li><li><strong>Lunge: </strong>when you stand with your legs apart (either one in front of the other or laterally) and bend both legs so there’s weight on one at a time, then stand back up. Examples: split squats and lateral lunges.</li><li><strong>Hinge:</strong> any movement where you have to hinge from your hips. Examples: deadlifts, single-leg deadlifts, sumo deadlifts, and kettlebell swings.</li><li><strong>Carry: </strong>when you carry a heavy weight around, like a dumbbell or kettlebell. Examples: farmer's carry, single arm carry, and overhead carry.</li></ul><p>Start strength training with full-body workouts two days a week at a minimum, she says. During both of those days, you should hit at least one exercise from each category of the foundational movement patterns, which will usually take around 40 to 60 minutes.</p><p>This way, “you get enough challenge and work to stimulate muscle growth,” she says. Try that for four to six weeks, and see how your body feels—if your body is craving a third day of full-body training, feel free to add that in.</p><p>Once you’re working out for four days or more, McParland recommends splitting up your training into specific body parts. For example, you can schedule two upper-body days and two lower-body days, or a glute day, an upper-body workout day, a lower-body burn day, and a core workout day.</p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
