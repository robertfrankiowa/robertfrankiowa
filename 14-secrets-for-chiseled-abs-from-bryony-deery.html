"It's not about creating a new. It's about building in sustainable daily practices that just make you feel your best and self-sabotaging." Her followers went wild. "You're a dream," commented one. "Hot stuff," added another.</p><h2>3 She Drinks Warm Water with Lemon</h2><p>"Before a morning session, I'll have a glass of warm water with lemon, which aids digestion, and an oat milk collagen matcha using Enso's matcha powder and Dose & Co's dairy-free collagen," Bryony tells Sheerluxe.</p><h2>4 She Exercises on an Empty Stomach</h2><p>Some people fuel up with food pre-workout, but not Bryony. "I prefer to work out on an empty stomach as it better supports my energy and concentration. I always stress to my clients the importance of listening to your body and seeing food as fuel to enjoy, satisfy, and energize," she tells the publication.</p><figure><img title="4 She Exercises on an Empty Stomach" src="IMG/BB1pgZSc_4_she_exercises_on_an_empty_stomach.jpg" alt="4 She Exercises on an Empty Stomach"><figcaption><em>4 She Exercises on an Empty Stomach. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 She Starts Her Day with a Smoothie Bowl</h2><p>"Post-workout, I love a smoothie bowl – it's a great way to pack in the nutrition. My go-to blend is chocolate pea protein powder mixed with frozen banana, half an avocado, a large scoop of nut butter, and plant-based milk," Bryony says.</p><h2>6 This Is What She Has for Lunch</h2><p>"If I'm at home for lunch, I love a warm Buddha bowl, homemade miso soup with lots of vegetables and ginger, or avocado on sourdough toast," she dishes about her favorite mid-afternoon meals.</p><h2>7 She Does Pilates</h2><p>Bryony "was introduced to the idea of Pilates by my doctor as a type of rehab," she tells Harper's Bazaar. "I completely healed all my injuries through Pilates, which was something I thought would never happen." After experiencing the "physical and mental benefits" of Pilates, she made the decision to start teaching.</p><h2>8 Hot and Cold Therapy Changed Her Life</h2><p>"Daily Pilates and hot and cold therapy have completely changed my life. Now, I do infrared saunas and ice baths most mornings. That's obviously a big investment in a gym membership that gives me access to that every day, but it has taken my symptoms away. I now don't notice the arthritis at all," Bryony adds to Harper's.</p><h2>9 She Loves Walking</h2><p>Bryony also loves walking. "I think it's so meditative. I try to do 10,000 steps a day, but sometimes life gets in the way. The easiest way I find to manage it is to bookend your working day with walks. Splitting them up doesn't seem so overwhelming – because 10,000 steps mean walking for about an hour and 40 minutes, which seems a lot to do in one go," she says.</p><h2>10 Padel Tennis Is Her passion</h2><p>Her "other real passion" is padel [tennis]. "It's the fastest-growing sport, and I'm completely hooked. For me, it goes hand-in-hand with Pilates because it requires so much balance and core strength, and it really works your obliques. I would say that Pilates is a really complimentary practice for everything, though," she says to Bazaar.</p><figure><img title="10 Padel Tennis Is Her passion" src="IMG/BB1pgQH9_10_padel_tennis_is_her_passion.jpg" alt="10 Padel Tennis Is Her passion"><figcaption><em>10 Padel Tennis Is Her passion. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>11 She Has an Accountability Group</h2><p>Bryony doesn't just have workout buddies. She has an "accountability group" with her friends that meet on WhatsApp, "posting our workouts and walks, which really helps me stay on track. I also find ways of being social that feel a little more active and more conducive to wellness rather than always thinking, 'let's go for a drink,'" she says.</p><h2>12 She Swears by Habit Stacking</h2><p>Bryony also swears by "habit stacking," a method where you keep adding healthy habits. "For example, I'll call my assistant to brainstorm while I'm walking. Or, when I'm in the sauna, I have my legs up the wall, which really drains the fluid from them. I'm trying to always make my time as efficient as possible," she says.</p><h2>13 She Practices Intermittent Fasting Naturally</h2><p>"I don't purposefully intermittent fast, but I generally don't get hungry until about 10:30 a.m., when I will make either a smoothie bowl with spirulina or a protein shake using Form Nutrition protein powder. It's delicious!" Bryony says. For lunch, she has a salad with tofu, lettuce, broccoli, cucumber, edamame beans, and a miso dressing. A focus of mine is upping my protein and fiber," she says. "For dinner, I have something like fish with vegetables and rice, sweet potato, quinoa or pasta. I love pasta – it would definitely feature in my last meal!"</p><h2>14 She Enjoys Chocolate and Margaritas</h2><p>Bryony also enjoys dark chocolate, red wine, and Margaritas, "­which I order without salt and sugar. I don't crave refined sugar, but I might make some sweet potato brownies and protein balls for snacks," she says.</p><figure><img title="14 She Enjoys Chocolate and Margaritas" src="IMG/BB1pgXCS_14_she_enjoys_chocolate_and_margaritas.jpg" alt="14 She Enjoys Chocolate and Margaritas"><figcaption><em>14 She Enjoys Chocolate and Margaritas. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>14 She Increased Her Protein Intake</h2><p>"I noticed that my cravings really went down when increasing my protein intake – it definitely has a direct effect," Bryony adds. "Essentially, I just want foods that nourish and fuel my body. I see it almost like a mechanical system; you have to put in good to get out good," she says.
