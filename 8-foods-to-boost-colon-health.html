Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of whether you’re looking to improve digestive regularity, manage a pre-existing condition, or prevent a colon-related diagnosis, maintaining colon health is important for everyone. </p><p>The colon measures upwards of five feet long and is the final organ of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It aids in water and nutrient absorption, as well as waste excretion. However, one of the most significant details about the colon is that it’s (largely) home to the increasingly talked-about gut microbiome, which influences several elements of our overall health. </p><p>We can help amplify these impressive functions of the colon through intentional food choices. Here, we’ll outline nutrients that specifically benefit the colon, others that detract from colon health, and some of our favorite foods to boost colon health and support this vital organ.</p><h2>Nutrients That Support Colon Health</h2><p>“By focusing on a diet rich in fiber, probiotics, prebiotics and certain micronutrients, you can significantly boost colon health and reduce the risk of colorectal diseases,” says Kristen Carli, MS, RD, owner of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness. Let’s dive into each of these nutrients to better understand how they benefit the colon.</p><h3>Fiber</h3><p>“Fiber helps regulate bowel movements, reduces the risk of constipation, and promotes the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. It also binds to toxins and aids in their elimination from the body,” says Carli. </p><p>There’s two primary types of fiber: insoluble and soluble. As the name implies, insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water and adds bulk to food moving through the GI tract, promoting digestive regularity throughout the colon. </p><p>Meanwhile, soluble fiber dissolves in water, forming a gel that also encourages regularity. Additionally, this type of fiber notably serves as a prebiotic in the gut microbiome located in the colon. Prebiotics are essentially food for the bacteria living in the biome, helping them to thrive, multiply, and enable this microorganism community to support immune, brain, and metabolic health (just to name a few!). Fiber is found in plant-based foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and vegetables.</p><h3>Vitamin D</h3><p>“Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties and is linked to reduced colorectal cancer risk,” explains Carli. This is partly due to this elusive vitamin’s antioxidant qualities that benefit several organ systems, including the colon. Vitamin D can be obtained from sun exposure, fortified foods, egg yolks, fish oil, and seafood, though many folks in the northern hemisphere turn to a dietary supplement, as deficiency is common.</p><h3>Plant Compounds</h3><p>Speaking of antioxidants, plant compounds are some of the best sources available. As a lesser known group of micronutrients, plant compounds help to reduce inflammation throughout the body (and colon), and have been shown to potentially delay colon cancer cell growth and aid treatment. As you might imagine, plant compounds can be found in plant-based foods, like fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains.</p><h3>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h3><p>When it comes to healthy fats, omega-3 fatty acids are among the most talked-about. This is because they offer potent anti-inflammatory benefits for the colon and gut microbiome. Research also shows these fatty acids to be particularly soothing to the colon during treatment for certain diagnoses, like cancer. Omega-3s can be found in fatty fish, seaweeds, nuts, and seeds.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>As if we needed another reason to prioritize hydration, colon health is one to add to the list. “Drinking plenty of water helps keep stools soft and supports overall digestive health,” says Carli. Plus, water is required for fiber to do its job effectively. If we increase our fiber intake too quickly without also increasing our water consumption, stomach upset like gas, bloating, and constipation can occur.</p><h3>Probiotics</h3><p>Though technically not a nutrient, probiotics certainly deserve a mention here. “Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is crucial for proper digestion and immune function,” explains Carli. By consuming probiotic-rich foods, you're boosting the population of good bacteria in your biome, encouraging the system to thrive for optimal colon and overall health. Probiotic-rich foods include yogurt, cottage cheese, kefir, kombucha, miso paste, kimchi, sauerkraut, buttermilk, and tempeh.</p><h2>Nutrients to Limit for Optimal Colon Health</h2><p>On the other side of the coin, there are some nutrients to be wary of when colon health is the priority. These include alcohol, added sugar, and certain types of meat.</p><h3>Alcohol</h3><p>When it comes to pro-inflammatory foods, particularly in the GI tract, few are as notorious as alcohol. “Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of certain colon diagnoses, like cancer,” adds Carli. Alcohol consumption can also alter the microbial balance of our gut microbiome, potentially resulting in discomfort or exacerbation of colon-related difficulties, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><h3>Added Sugar</h3><p>Similarly, added sugar promotes inflammation in the colon and can negatively impact the gut microbiome. This can lead to nagging tummy troubles or flare-ups of any present chronic concerns, like ulcerative colitis.</p><h3>Red and Processed Meat</h3><p>Red and processed meats, again, promote an inflammatory response in the colon, but there’s also plenty of evidence to back their association with colon-based cancers. Delicious high-protein alternatives include skinless poultry, seafood, eggs, fermented dairy, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains.</p><h2>8 Colon Health-Boosting Foods</h2><p>Thankfully, there are so many tasty food options within these nutritional parameters that support your best colon health. Here are some colon healthy foods:</p><h3>Avocado</h3><p>As an excellent source of anti-inflammatory plant compounds and both soluble and insoluble fiber, avocados are undoubtedly a colon-healthy food. This veggie (though technically a fruit) can be seamlessly added to both sweet and savory dishes, like smoothies, puddings, salads, toast, dips, spreads, and more.</p><h3>Berries</h3><p>Whether it be raspberries, cranberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, elderberries, or otherwise, berries of all kinds are fantastic for your colon. This is thanks to their robust fiber, water, and plant compound content, working to swiftly reduce inflammation throughout your body (and your colon). Add these beloved fruits to baked goods, oatmeal, smoothies, dry cereal, salads, dressings, and sauces.</p><h3>Yogurt</h3><p>One of the most accessible sources of probiotics is yogurt, encouraging a flourishing gut microbiome. Yogurt is the perfect healthy swap-out for sour cream, mayonnaise, and even cream cheese in a variety of recipes, both sweet and savory. Plus, it adds a subtle creaminess to breakfast bowls, smoothies, dips, and more.</p><h3>Legumes</h3><p>Beans, peas, peanuts, and lentils make up the legume family, and are remarkable sources of fiber and plant compounds (not to mention protein and other key micronutrients). This helps to promote motility and inflammation-reduction throughout the colon. Whether you opt to add these humble plant-based favorites to salads, soups, stews, stir fries, tacos, or otherwise, there’s no shortage of yummy ways to enjoy legumes.</p><h3>Walnuts</h3><p>Nuts and seeds of all kinds are fantastic grabs when colon health is top of mind, thanks to their fiber and plant compound content. However, walnuts are especially beneficial due to their omega-3 fatty acid content. This lends them to being colon superfoods that can be easily stirred into baked goods, salads, soups, smoothies, chia pudding, and more.</p><h3>Tempeh</h3><p>Regardless of whether you’re plant-based or not, tempeh is a super tasty addition to any meal. It’s just an added bonus that it’s rich in fiber, probiotics, and plant compounds—a colon trifecta, if you will. And while the thought of cooking tempeh may be intimidating, this plant-based protein can be prepared like many other protein options: baked, roasted, sauteed, or grilled. Its mild flavor also serves as the perfect palate for any flavor combinations you love.</p><h3>Sardines</h3><p>Yes, sardines are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, but these tiny fish are also one of the few natural dietary sources of vitamin D, making them an excellent addition to a colon-friendly eating routine. They can be enjoyed as a snack right out of the can, made into a fish salad for sandwiches, or added to pastas, soups, and tray bakes.</p><p>And finally, we have the popular blue-green algae, spirulina! Spirulina is packed with soluble and insoluble fiber, as well as plant compounds and omega-3 fatty acids. This trendy ingredient is most frequently enjoyed as a smoothie addition, but you could reasonably sneak it into certain dressings, sauces, and baked goods. </p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Ultimately, caring for our colon health is caring for our whole body health, as so many vital functions are related to this organ…not to mention it’s where the gut microbiome is located. While regular visits to your healthcare provider are key to keeping your colon in tip-top shape, everyday lifestyle choices can make a massive impact. Through opting for foods that benefit the colon and limiting those that don’t, we can help to prevent chronic illness and enjoy greater GI regularity and comfort in our day-to-day lives.</p></main>
