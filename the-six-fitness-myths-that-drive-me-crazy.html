The sheer abundance of self-declared “experts” offering solutions to improving health, wellbeing, fitness, and more, is overwhelming. While some simply have good intentions, others might be pushing an agenda... or perhaps just their new range of weight loss teas.</p><p>Either way, the mass of information and worse, misinformation, is often contradictory and confusing and could easily leave you wondering who you can trust or what to believe. So, to help you navigate through the noise, here are some of the most common fitness myths that deserve to be debunked.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">1. You need to stretch before you exercise </h2><p>We’re often told to stretch before a workout. But the latest research shows that this won’t reduce your risk of injury and could even make you more vulnerable.</p><p>The scientists found prolonged stretching may actually lead to a short-term reduction in strength, so you could be more likely to overestimate how far you can push your body. Rather than stretching, try warming up with a few key moves that will get your body ready for the workout you’re about to do. Prior to activities like running or racket sports, perform exercises like knee raises, hip rotations, calf raises, squats, and lunges.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">2. Running is bad for your joints</h2><p>Contrary to belief, running can actually benefit joints. When you run, the impact places stress on your bones and as a result they become stronger and denser. Running works the muscles which support your knee joints and will strengthen your cartilage, tendons and ligaments. However, the key is ensuring your body is prepared for running. Strengthen your muscles with exercises such as lunges and deadlifts. This will increase your endurance so that you can maintain good posture as your body tires, reducing your risk of injury.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">3. Lifting weights leads to a bulky body </h2><p>Surprisingly, there’s a significant distinction between gaining strength and building muscle. Most weightlifting routines won’t notably increase muscle size without an extensive volume of sets and surplus calories – around nine to 20 sets per week per muscle group for substantial gains, which may be impractical for many. </p><p>In contrast, strength can be developed with much lower volumes, even just one to two sets per week for a specific body part, although aiming for five to 10 sets across two to three workouts is ideal. Regardless of the approach – whether lifting heavier weights with eight to 10 reps or using lighter weights for 20-30 reps – you’ll build strength and experience additional health benefits, such as an increased metabolism, all without getting ‘bulky’.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">4. The best way to stay fit is to walk 10,000 steps every day</h2><p>People who regularly walk long distances tend to live longer, that’s a given. However, 10,000 steps isn’t necessarily a ‘magic number’ and many of us don’t have the time to hit that mythical target. In truth, you can get similar heart health benefits with far fewer steps, simply by dialling up the intensity. Aim for 4,000-6,000 steps walking at a slightly faster pace, so that you feel slightly breathless. Mix this up with other activities like strength training to preserve muscle and joint health, which will also raise your heart rate for similar benefits to those achieved through those additional steps.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">5. No pain, no gain </h2><p>While pushing your limits occasionally is necessary, it’s not a constant requirement. You don’t have to go all-out in every session. Most training should be tough but not too tough with sessions ranging from challenging to light to medium intensity. Yes, you can expect to feel ‘pain’ in those sessions where you lift very heavy weights, but for the vast majority of people, this shouldn’t be done too often. </p><p>Your training should feel challenging but not consistently painful. Strength gains can come from moderate resistance at higher reps too. So reserve your highest intensity efforts mainly for occasional strength sessions or specific cardio intervals. One all-out heavy session a week is enough for anyone training for health and strength.  </p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">6.  Cutting carbs will make me lose weight</h2><p>While cutting carbs is a popular weight loss strategy, most people fail to keep it up in the long term. The main reason it works is that it reduces overall calorie intake, creating a deficit. However, sustaining a low-carb diet may prove challenging, as carbohydrates provide essential energy, fibre, and nutrients. Rather than cutting carbs completely, try eliminating one or two specific foods. </p><p>For instance, you can temporarily avoid bread while still consuming other carbs like potatoes. Similarly, consider reducing fats, such as using less oil in cooking and salads or simply by opting for fat-free dairy. </p><p>The latter point is a good option for another reason, because it will be effective at reducing calories without unintentionally lowering protein intake. Overall, a targeted approach like this is more sustainable in the short and long term, promoting a healthier relationship with food. It’s easier to stick to, and ultimately more enjoyable, making it a practical and effective dietary choice. </p></main>
