    <main><h1>Three Words To Keep You On Track When You’re Struggling With Your Fitness Motivation</h1><p>If you’re trying to get fitter and healthier, here are three words that can help keep you on track: “<strong>Never Miss Twice”.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you’re doing well with your fitness and healthy eating habits, checking off your to-do list every day.</p><p>And then, you have a bad day. You get sick. You have a bad night’s sleep and you feel really tired. Something urgent comes up at work. Whatever the reason, you miss your workout.</p><p>It’s ok, it happens to everyone. What matters is what you do next.</p><p>When you miss one of your “process goals”, you’re at a crossroad.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Sharon Gam, Ph.D." src="IMG/AA1iPLmx_three_words_to_keep_you_on_track_when_youre_struggling_with_your_fitness_motivation.jpg" alt="Three Words To Keep You On Track When You’re Struggling With Your Fitness Motivation"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Sharon Gam, Ph.D.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You could go one of two ways:</strong></p><p>You miss the next workout too. Maybe your next one wasn’t scheduled for a couple of days, and when it comes around you feel a little unmotivated. Maybe you talk yourself out of it: “I already missed one workout this week, I’ll just rest and start again next week.”</p><p>Once you lose momentum, it’s much harder to get started again. Soon, that one missed workout snowballs into a few in a row, and you’re “off” your workout program.</p><p><strong>Or..</strong>.</p><p>You get back on track immediately. You move your next workout up to the next day (or as soon as you possibly can), and you approach that workout with the same enthusiasm and drive. Then you keep moving forward as if nothing happened.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Never Miss Twice</strong></h2><p>Next time you fail to follow through on your planned action, whatever it is, be absolutely sure you achieve it the next time.</p><p>Don’t feel guilty, and don’t get down on yourself. There’s no need for that.</p><p>It’s ok to miss a workout once in a while. Nobody’s perfect, and nobody maintains their healthy habits perfectly all the time. Missing a healthy habit doesn’t indicate anything about your worth or your willpower. Things happen. That’s life.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Sharon Gam, Ph.D." src="IMG/AA1iPET9_three_words_to_keep_you_on_track_when_youre_struggling_with_your_fitness_motivation.jpg" alt="Three Words To Keep You On Track When You’re Struggling With Your Fitness Motivation"><figcaption><em>. Provided by Sharon Gam, Ph.D.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Don’t try to overcompensate to make up for the miss. You don’t need to do that either.</p><p>Just make sure you do what you were planning to do at the very next opportunity.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Perfection is not required to achieve your goals, but consistency is.</strong></h2><p>There’s even research on this. In one of the best studies done on real-world habits, the researchers found that missing a habit goal one day didn’t prevent people from building lasting habits, as long as they didn’t miss more than one in a row.</p><p>So, next time you slip up, whether it’s a workout, a not-so-healthy meal, or whatever you’re working on, remember to NEVER MISS TWICE.</p><p>Do everything you can to get right back on track immediately.</p><p>If you’re a real overachiever, you can do some thinking about why you missed your habit goal and come up with some strategies to make it less likely to happen again.</p><p>Then keep moving forward.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">If You Need Help</h2><p>To get started on your fitness journey right now, check out my Strength Training For Anxiety Program.
