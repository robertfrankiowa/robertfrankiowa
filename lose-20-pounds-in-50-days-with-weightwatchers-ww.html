    <main><h1>Lose 20 Pounds in 50 Days with WeightWatchers (WW)</h1><p>WeightWatchers (now known as WW) can be a useful tool in weight loss, as the program encourages steady results. Instead of eliminating whole food groups, the WW system assigns points for different types of foods based on calories and nutrients. Each person has their own points and can adapt their diet accordingly. "Fad diets are tempting, but they're not sustainable over the long run," says Angela Goscilo, MS, RD, senior manager of nutrition at WeightWatchers. While the WW method is very effective, certain things can help the process along. Here's how to lose 20 pounds in 50 days with WeightWatchers.</p><figure><img title="Lose 20 Pounds in 50 Days with WeightWatchers (WW)" src="IMG/BB1omTsi_lose_20_pounds_in_50_days_with_weightwatchers_ww.jpg" alt="Lose 20 Pounds in 50 Days with WeightWatchers (WW)"><figcaption><em>Lose 20 Pounds in 50 Days with WeightWatchers (WW).

Water is calorie-free, so it's a great alternative to sugary, high-calorie beverages such as alcohol or sodas. "Drinking more water can help with satiety," board-certified obesity medicine doctor Vivek Gupta, MD, MPH, tells WW.</p><h2>2 Have a Protein-Packed Breakfast</h2><p>Studies show that people who eat breakfast tend to eat less throughout the day. "To get the most nutrient bang for your breakfast buck and start your day on a high note, choose foods with a mix of carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber," says Henry Ford Health. "Carbs will give you energy right away, protein will sustain you through the mornin, and the fiber will help you feel full for at least a few hours (probably more)."</p><h2>3 Watch Out For Added Sugars</h2><p>Added sugars are bad for your waistline and your health. Instead of eating sugary ultra-processed foods, have fruit. Although fruits have natural sugars, they are also packed with antioxidants, fiber, and other nutrients.</p><h2>4 Eat More Fiber</h2><p>"Most processed foods, ultra-processed foods, and beverages do not contain fiber or minimal fiber, making them accessible to absorbable high-calorie content [calorie-dense foods] and favoring obesity," says the Obesity Medicine Association. "Natural alternatives are ideal high-fiber foods for weight loss."</p><h2>5 Track Your Food</h2><p>Tracking your food is helpful for weight loss. "Registry showed that 74.4% of members who lost at least 20 pounds on WeightWatchers and kept it off for at least a year track their food most of the time or all of the time," according to WW. Keep a journal or use an app to stay on top of your intake.</p><h2>6 Set Realistic Goals</h2><p>Making huge drastic changes is often unsustainable in the long run. By setting realistic goals that set you up to succeed, you will be motivated to keep going. Remember, it's not just about losing weight but keeping it off.</p><figure><img title="6 Set Realistic Goals" src="IMG/BB1omOYh_6_set_realistic_goals.jpg" alt="6 Set Realistic Goals"><figcaption><em>6 Set Realistic Goals. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Prep Your Meals</h2><p>Prepping and planning meals can help you stick to the program. "Many times unhealthy foods are chosen because of convenience," registered dietitian Silvia Veri tells Corewell Health. "If we can take the time out to plan meals, write a grocery list and have fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans available, they will become convenient and eaten more often."</p><h2>8 Move Your Body</h2><p>Moving your body throughout the day burns extra calories and positively impacts your mental health. Just walking more and sitting less is great for weight loss and for your mood. Find ways to get extra steps in wherever you can—every little bit helps.</p><figure><img title="8 Move Your Body" src="IMG/AA1nLoMz_8_move_your_body.jpg" alt="8 Move Your Body"><figcaption><em>8 Move Your Body. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Be Mindful of Portions</h2><p>Are you aware of what a portion size is? Knowing what a typical plate of food looks like can help prevent overeating. After a while, it will become second nature.</p><h2>10 Lift Weights</h2><p>Lifting weights not only supports bone health and overall strength, it encourages fat burning even at rest. "Certain strength training exercises, such as push-ups and squats, are especially effective at helping you burn fat and build muscle because they target multiple body parts at once," says the University of Maryland Medical System. "Strength training circuits can help boost your calorie burn by getting your heart rate up and serving as a way to do both cardio and strength at the same time."</p><figure><img title="10 Lift Weights" src="IMG/BB1lotXG_10_lift_weights.jpg" alt="10 Lift Weights"><figcaption><em>10 Lift Weights. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>11 Get Good Sleep</h2><p>Healthy adults need at least 7 hours of sleep every night for optimum health and wellness. Studies show poor sleep can undermine weight loss and fat burning in a number of different ways: Sleep impacts appetite and cortisol spikes can encourage belly fat accumulation.</p><h2>12 Watch Those Pours</h2><p>Be careful about your alcohol intake while trying to lose weight. The extra calories really add up even without mixers, and as they are empty calories, you get no nutrition out of them. Alcohol is also notorious for disrupting sleep.
