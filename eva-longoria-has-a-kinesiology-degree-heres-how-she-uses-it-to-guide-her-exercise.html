Provided by TODAY</em></figcaption></figure><p>For Eva Longoria, working out is ingrained in her daily routine. </p><p>The multifaceted star looks at fitness and moving her body as her “meditation, my ‘me hour,’ my self-care,” she tells TODAY.com.</p><p>Longoria, 49, is constantly on the go, from starring in and executive producing her new Apple TV+ dramedy “Land of Women,” to directing, running her multiple companies, including tequila company Casa Del Sol, advocacy work and taking care of her 6-year-old son, Santiago. </p><p>Despite her busy schedule, the “Desperate Housewives” star dedicates 30 minutes to an hour — sometimes more — to working out. </p><p>And when it comes to her diet, she says she doesn’t live by any “hard or fast rules of restrictions,” though she does gravitate towards healthier foods. </p><p>Ahead, Longoria shares a look at how she stays in shape on and off set. </p><h2>Longoria established her healthy habits long ago</h2><p>Longoria says that her approach to diet and fitness “really hasn’t” throughout her life. </p><p>“I’ve <em>always</em> been an exerciser,” Longoria says. “It gives me energy,” she says. “I don’t really do it for vain reasons, I do it for my mental health.”</p><p>Her love for fitness goes way back, she says, “I was an aerobics instructor in college, I was a trainer. My degree is in kinesiology, so it’s just been part of my lifestyle. It’s not something that I do, it’s part of my life.”</p><p>As for her diet, she says that when she’s on vacation, “I’m on vacation. (But) when I have to prepare for something, I prepare for something.” </p><p>“I don’t think I live by any hard and fast rules of restriction. I think it’s just moderation and just common sense,” she says. “I’m lucky that I gravitate to healthy things. I love fish and vegetables. I love chicken and vegetables. I love beef and vegetables.”</p><p>As a Mexican American, she says, she not a big bread person. “I didn’t grow up with bread. I’m Mexican. We grew up with tortillas,” she says. “The Mexican diet, in its origins, is pretty healthy.”</p><p>The “Flamin’ Hot” director also shares that she does not have a sweet tooth. </p><p>“I don’t like desserts and sweets,” she says. “I don’t like sweet things. Dessert comes and people go, ‘Oh, I have to have dessert.’ I’m like, eh, pass.”</p><p>However, Longoria says she is a big wine lover.</p><h2>She finds that she opts for healthier meals when she's on set</h2><p>With her wellness routine an every day non-negotiable, Longoria rarely strays from it. She does say, however, that she eats better when she is on a set. </p><p>“Yeah, I actually eat better and healthier because you have a caterer that’s really making everything for you,” she says. “When I’m not on a set, you’re left to your own devices. So sometimes people think that's the opposite, ‘Oh, when I’m on a set, I eat so much.’ I think it’s easier because you have somebody there and you go, ‘Can I have a bowl of avocado and Turkey?’”</p><h2>Her favorite work outs test her strength and her endurance</h2><p>Strength training and trampoline cardio are Longoria’s go-to workouts. </p><p>“Strength training, weights and bounce,” Longoria says of her routine. “I either do strength training or I bounce.”</p><p>She says she either does 30 minutes of rebounding, the trampoline workouts, or she lifsts weights for an hour.</p><p>Back in 2022, she told Women's Health that she began rebounding in 2020 when stuck at home during the pandemic. She tried The Ness, a New York trampoline studio, which offered classes on-demand, and has done it ever since. (Goldie Hawn is also a fan of the trampoline workouts.)</p><p>Longoria also shared with the magazine that she likes using heavy weights and doing squats on a weight rack with at least one 25-pound plate on each end. She uses 50-pound plates on her hips when she does hip thrusts. </p><p>And even when she’s traveling and doesn’t have time to do a full session, she told the magazine she’ll go for a walk or stretch. “I need to do something.”</p></main>
