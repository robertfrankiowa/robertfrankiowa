    <main><h1>5 Amazing Health Benefits of Avocados</h1><p>Avocados are on the menu pretty often at my house. My family loves them, and I love all the health benefits of avocados.</p><figure><img title="Provided by MomsWhoSave" src="IMG/AA12vnLB_avocado_health_benefits.jpg" alt="avocado health benefits"><figcaption><em>health benefits of avocados.

Now, when you eat out, you can get avocado sandwiches, salads, and all sorts of entrées. That’s because the world at large is finally aware of just how healthy avocados are! You might be surprised by these <strong>five Amazing Health Benefits of Avocados</strong>.</p><h2>1. Improve Your Heart Health</h2><p>While avocados are full of fat, one of the many health benefits of avocados is that their main fat is oleic acid (the same fat found in olive oil). Replace unhealthy fats in your diet with avocados, and you’ll instantly make your diet more heart healthy. Also, avocados can help improve your cholesterol, and they can reduce inflammation. All of that helps make your heart healthier!</p><figure><img title="Provided by MomsWhoSave" src="IMG/AA12vIAJ_5_amazing_health_benefits_of_avocados_1.jpg" alt="5 Amazing Health Benefits of Avocados 1"><figcaption><em>5 Amazing Health Benefits of Avocados.

Absorb More Nutrients</h2><p>It doesn’t do you any good to have a super healthy diet if your body isn’t absorbing the good nutrients you’re putting into it. Some vitamins and nutrients are fat soluble, like vitamins A, D, E, and K. That means your body can’t use them unless they’re paired with fats. Rather than pairing good nutrients with bad fats, pair them with the good fats in avocados. Depending on the meal, avocados can hugely increase how many good nutrients your body absorbs!</p><h2>3. Aid Weight Loss</h2><p>That’s right, to lose weight you should eat fatty avocados! But remember, avocados are full of good fats that your body actually uses. These good fats, along with avocados’ other nutrients, allow them to help you lose weight in one clever way— they make you feel full longer. This is because not only are avocados full of filing fats and fiber, but since they help your body absorb more nutrients, your body is less likely to feel hungry again soon after a meal (your body may signal hunger if missing nutrients). So eat avocados, and you’ll eat fewer snacks and second helpings!</p><figure><img title="Provided by MomsWhoSave" src="IMG/AA12vUAX_5_amazing_health_benefits_of_avocados_2.jpg" alt="5 Amazing Health Benefits of Avocados 2"><figcaption><em>5 Amazing Health Benefits of Avocados.

Avocados are full of antioxidants, including the eye-aiding antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. These two nutrients are critical to maintaining good eye health, but your body can’t synthesize them on its own, so you have to get them from your diet. Keep your body stocked with lutein and zeaxanthin, and you’ll reduce your risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.</p><h2>5. Improve Your Gut Health</h2><p>Avocados are full of a surprising amount of fiber (one avocado contains about 25% of your daily recommended amount of fiber). As a result, one of the benefits of avocados is that they are good for your gut. Fiber helps keep things moving through your digestive system. And soluble fiber, which is part of avocados’ total fiber, keeps your intestines stocked with good bacteria.</p><p><em>Are avocados part of your diet?</em></p><p><em>_________________</em></p><p><strong>Try these avocado recipes</strong> —</p><p><strong><em>Low Carb Turkey Club Egg Wrap With Spinach and Avocado</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Easy Vegan Avocado Chocolate Mousse Recipe</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Avocado and Tomato Salad</em></strong></p><p><em>_________________</em></p></main>
