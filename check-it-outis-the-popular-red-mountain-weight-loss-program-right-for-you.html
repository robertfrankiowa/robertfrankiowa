Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>More and more people are turning to medical interventions and working with doctors on their weight loss journey. If you live in Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma or Texas, you may be at least somewhat familiar with Red Mountain Weight Loss Centers.</p><p>Founded by <strong>Dr. Suzanne Bentz, D.O.</strong>, Red Mountain is one of the biggest weight loss health center chains in the United States. What are Red Mountain weight loss methods and how do they work? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2>What is Red Mountain Weight Loss?</h2><p>Red Mountain has two main weight loss programs. </p><p>The first is RM3, a three-step program that includes guidelines with a diet plan, medications, supplements, recipe ideas and workout videos. This program is designed to help patients lose up to 20 pounds or more per month and maintain that weight.</p><p>The second is RM Lifestyle, which is designed to help patients lose six to 10 pounds per month, and is considered a more gradual weight loss approach. Doctors in the program suggest certain medications and supplements to align with a macronutrient diet. </p><p>A third program is called RM Flex, designed to help patients lose 15 pounds per month with semaglutide medication and lifestyle changes.</p><h2>How Much Weight Can You Lose with Red Mountain Weight Loss?</h2><p>“The amount of weight that a patient will lose on the Red Mountain program will depend on their starting weight,” says <strong>DJ Mazzoni, RD, MS, CDN, CSCS</strong>, a registered dietitian/nutritionist and medical reviewer at Illuminate Health. “Individuals starting at a higher weight will lose more weight adhering to a diet program on average because their daily energy requirements are higher than someone at a lower weight.”</p><p>Red Mountain's website suggests that patients may lose up to 20 pounds per month, but that sounds like a high estimate: Healthy, sustainable weight loss usually doesn't exceed two pounds per week, according to Mazzoni, which equates to about eight pounds per month.</p><h2>What the Red Mountain Weight Loss Diet Plan Looks Like</h2><p>The Red Mountain weight loss program includes food in various categories, like lean protein, fruits and vegetables. It allows for healthy starches, too.</p><p>“This is a diet similar to the Mediterranean Diet, and I believe it's a much healthier diet model than what most Americans consume,” says Mazzoni. </p><p>Overall, the program is a healthy approach, but there is little evidence to suggest the effectiveness of weight loss supplements for lasting weight loss.</p><p>That being said, the Red Mountain diet model seems like a healthy and sustainable option for overweight and obese patients seeking to lose weight, Mazzoni explains. “I wouldn't recommend their weight loss supplements, as there is very little research suggesting that weight loss supplements are effective for sustained weight loss," Mazzoni says. "Increasing dietary fiber intake is a cheaper alternative to weight loss supplements which is proven in medical research to be effective, and is the approach I would recommend over Red Mountain's weight loss supplements.”</p><p>Here are a few pros and cons of Red Mountain, according to <strong>Holly Klamer, MS, RDN:</strong></p><h2>Pros of Red Mountain</h2><p>Klamer lists the following points as pros of participating in the Red Mountain weight loss program: </p><ul><li>A bariatric physician supervises weight loss and takes bloodwork into account.</li><li>There's a focus on an individualized weight loss plan.</li><li>The focus is on long-term success and breaking the cycle of yo-yo dieting.</li><li>It can be helpful for weight loss for those who feel like they have tried everything without success.</li><li>The program includes weekly check-ins.</li><li>If determined necessary by your provider, you may be able to get a prescription for semaglutide medication, the same active ingredient in Wegovy. And if you're needle averse (we see you!), you may be able to get it prescribed as a tablet instead of an injection.</li></ul><h2>Cons of Red Mountain</h2><p>Here are some of the potentials cons of Red Mountain, according to Klamer:</p><ul><li>This center uses Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) as part of the medically supervised weight loss program, which may cause some hesitation, as the FDA suggests HCG is not effective for weight loss, and most studies have not shown HCG to be significant for weight loss. That said, plans are customized for each client, so this may not even be part of your journey.</li></ul><ul><li>The weight loss boosters claim to decrease hunger and boost metabolism, but the complete list of ingredients is not listed, so it is not clear what is in these products that would help boost weight loss and if they are research-backed.</li></ul><p>Like most weight loss programs, Red Mountain comes with benefits and drawbacks—so ultimately, you will need to decide what works best for you and your lifestyle. And as always, never be afraid to chat with a doctor or nutritionist about the best weight loss approach for you!</p></main>
