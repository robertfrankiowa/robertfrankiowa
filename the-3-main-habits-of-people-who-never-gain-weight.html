Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all know someone who never seems to gain weight, and we’ve probably all wondered what their secret is.</p><p>It could be their dedication to exercise. It could be their fondness for fresh vegetables from the farmer’s market. It could be a combination of factors, including their genetics. Here’s what you can learn from them—including one thing in particular that they never do, and three main habits they implement in their lives. </p><h2>Why You’re Gaining Weight</h2><p>A lot of us tend to gain weight as we age without even realizing it. It might not be a lot of weight—experts suggest a pound or two per year is pretty typical throughout middle age—but over time, it adds up. </p><p>In addition to the passage of time, you may also be able to blame your family—to some degree, that is.</p><p>Genetics do play a role in our weight, and whether we struggle to lose a few pounds or maintain a healthy weight. In fact, some research suggests that variants in several genes seem to increase appetite or the sensation of hunger and food intake. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity is likely the result of a complex interaction between genetics and environment that isn’t yet fully understood. </p><p><strong>Dr. Andrew Peredo, MD</strong>, a plastic surgeon who performs body composition contouring procedures like liposuction says, “Genetics plays a role in the rate at which a person’s metabolism works. Those with faster metabolisms from their genetics typically burn more calories and don’t gain as much weight as those with slower metabolisms.”</p><p>While you can't change your family history, we do have <em>some </em>control. “There are many other factors as to why people never gain weight and genetics cannot be the only cause looked at,” says Dr. Peredo.</p><p>“Genetics does set the stage,” says <strong>Dr. Michelle Pearlman, MD, </strong>a gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist with Prime Institute in Miami, Florida. “But that doesn’t mean that we can’t become healthier versions of ourselves.” </p><h2>The One Thing People Who Never Gain Weight Always Avoid</h2><p>If you know someone who never seems to gain weight, you can probably bet that they're not giving in to fad diets. “The biggest misconception is the fad diets,” says Dr. <strong>Ana Maria Kausel, MD,</strong> an endocrinologist and co-founder of Anzara Health in Miami. “Nothing that makes you lose weight short term will stay. The success of weight loss depends on consistency…and change of life habits, not a short-term dietary restriction or juice cleanse.”</p><p>Dr. Lin agrees that no specific diet has been shown to produce superior benefits in weight loss after one year. “Instead, consistent, low-calorie meals, especially breakfast, with a variety of foods may be key to minimizing the body’s physiological adaptations that resist weight loss,” he says.</p><h2>3 Main Habits of People Who Never Gain Weight</h2><h3>1. They eat a healthy diet</h3><p>Chances are, people who are keeping the weight off are making good dietary choices, picking foods that pack plenty of nutrition without a lot of added sugars and fats to weigh them down.</p><p>Regardless of whether it makes a significant impact on your weight, eating a healthy diet can help prevent diabetes, stroke, heart disease, and other conditions that can shorten your life. As obesity medicine specialist <strong>Dr. Dina Peralta-Reich, MD,</strong> puts it, “Make sure you’re putting good caloric energy into your body.”</p><p>It doesn’t mean that you have to give up ice cream or other treats, but you do want to make sure you’re eating foods that are good for your body. </p><p>“I always say the key to life is moderation,” says Dr. Peredo, who often sees patients who are eager to lose that last five pounds or those areas of stubborn fat. “Everything in moderation is okay. It’s when it’s in excess that you can have harmful effects. So, enjoy sweets or the beverage that you like in moderation.”</p><h3>2. They eat until they’re satisfied</h3><p>Not only that, but it can be helpful to be mindful about what you’re eating. Remember: It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to register that you feel full, notes Dr. Pearlman. </p><p>“It’s how we’re eating, how fast we are eating, how we feel when we are eating, and how late we are eating,” says Dr. Pearlman. “We need to stop eating when we’re full, and that takes time. Digestion starts in the mouth. We need to be really chewing our food and that allows for adequate digestion.”</p><p>So, if you’re rushing through a big meal, barely registering what you’re eating, only to feel bloated and uncomfortable afterward, it’s time to change your approach.</p><p>Start by putting away your smartphone or your tablet and paying attention to what you are eating. Take more time to eat, experiencing how each food tastes and feels in your mouth. And when you feel full, stop eating. Just eat until you feel satisfied, says Dr. Pearlman. Don’t feel like you need to clean your plate. </p><p>You might also want to close the kitchen door at night, says <strong>Dr. Samuel J. Lin, MD</strong>, a plastic surgeon with Boston Plastic Surgery and an associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, who suggests skipping the late-night snacks. </p><p>“Late-night eating causes disruptions in your circadian rhythms, changes in body temperature cycles, and increase free cortisol production to increase your risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome,” he explains. </p><p>“Most people that can maintain a healthy weight are physically active,” says Dr. Peralta-Reich, founder and director of New York Weight Wellness Medicine.</p><p>Research tells us that you’re more likely to gain weight when you’re sedentary. Experts usually recommend logging at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per week. If you want to lose weight, however, or maintain weight loss, however, you may need to exercise even more, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>And while exercise is great, it doesn’t have to be a formal gym routine for the physical activity to count. In fact, Dr. Pearlman says that she prefers the “moving our bodies” over “exercise.” </p><p>“People who have very active jobs often tend to do better because they are obviously constantly moving,” she says. </p><p>You might want to incorporate some strength training into your routine regularly. Strength training can help you build and maintain muscle mass, which can help you maintain a healthy weight but also keep you healthier and increase your longevity. You may be envious of a skinny friend, but stop and think about whether your skinny friend is all that healthy. They may have a relatively high percentage of body fat and a low percentage of muscle mass. </p><p>“Being skinny or not gaining weight does not necessarily mean they are healthy,” notes Dr. Peralta-Reich. “You can be skinny fat. Those are slim people, but their habits are not the best.”</p><h2>If You're Considering a Weight Loss Drug...</h2><p>At some point, good choices may not be enough to help you keep the weight off.</p><p>“While diet and exercise are almost universally important factors, weight management can be very individualized,” says Dr. Lin. “Baseline weight and pre-existing conditions can impact your ability to keep the weight off, and more intensive interventions, including medications and surgery, may be indicated,” he says. </p><p>However, even if you are taking a prescription drug like Ozempic or Wegovy for diabetes and weight loss, you still have to think about making healthy choices every day, doctors say. Once your body gets accustomed to the medication your weight may plateau. And if you eventually stop taking it, you may gain the lost weight back. </p><p>That’s why it's important to talk to your doctor about an individualized approach that takes into account your unique needs, including your health and your history. </p></main>
