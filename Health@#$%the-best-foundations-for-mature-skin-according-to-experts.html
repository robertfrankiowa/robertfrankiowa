The same can be said for makeup, especially complexion products because they have the power to enhance skin or leave it looking dry, dull and cakey. </p><p>Luckily, there’s a well-spring of beautiful formulas on the market to choose from. Shop TODAY consulted three professional makeup artists to learn what to look for, what to avoid, which products are actually worth it and application tips to ensure you get the most out of your formula. </p><p><strong>What separates foundation for mature skin from the rest?</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>What to look for</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>What to avoid</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Expert picks</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Best drug store foundations</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>How we chose</strong><strong> | </strong><strong>Meet </strong><strong>the experts</strong></p><h2>What makes foundation for mature skin different from other types of foundation?</h2><p>It all comes down to consistency, finish and ingredients. “Foundations for mature skin tend to be more lightweight but still have enough coverage to disguise concerns such as redness or dark spots,” says makeup artist Brianna Farfel. “Most of them also have skin care benefits within the formula, as well as SPF, and are very hydrating to create a glowy look.” </p><p>While moisturizing formulas are typically great for mature skin because they result in a fresh, radiant finish, Farfel notes that they may feel too sticky or greasy for some skin types. </p><p>Makeup artist Jonet Williamson adds that foundations for mature skin are distinct in that they often chiefly focus on hydration, plumping, firming, protecting from UV damage and sometimes even filling in fine lines. </p><h2>What to look for in foundations for mature skin</h2><p>Williamson recommends looking for foundations formulated with skin-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid, grapeseed oil and vitamin E for added hydration, as well as silicone-based formulas because they’re best for filling in fine lines and wrinkles. </p><p>She also prefers opting for a "natural-radiant finish" that she says "looks gorgeous on mature skin."</p><p>If your skin is mature but still on the oily side, makeup artist Elisa Flowers suggests looking for formulas that contain minerals to help absorb excess shine and subtly blur pores. “Look for ingredients such as mica or synthetic fluorphlogopite, which is a more eco-friendly and sustainable version of mica,” she suggests. “Also look for iron oxide, zinc oxide and titanium.”  </p><p>When it comes to texture, Farfel recommends going with creamy or serum-like formulas as these will appear the most natural. “The finish should be soft, hydrated and glowy rather than matte because this will exaggerate wrinkles and dry out the skin,” she explains. </p><h2>What should you avoid in foundations for mature skin?</h2><p>Williamson advises against formulas that are super full coverage or overly matte. “These tend to fall flat, settle into fine lines and look a bit unflattering on mature skin,” she explains. </p><p>“I recommend staying away from thick and heavy powder foundations because powder is drying and can look chalky or draw attention to uneven texture, pores and wrinkles,” Flowers adds. “Also avoid super thick (liquid) foundation formulas which sit on the skin like a mask and accentuate uneven textures on the skin.”</p><p>Both artists highly suggest swatching foundations on the side of your cheek or the back of your hand before buying it to see what the finish actually looks like. “If the formula you’re trying out doesn’t look nice on the back of your hand, it will never look great on your face,” warns Flowers. </p><h2>Best foundations for mature skin, according to makeup artists</h2><h3>Too Faced
