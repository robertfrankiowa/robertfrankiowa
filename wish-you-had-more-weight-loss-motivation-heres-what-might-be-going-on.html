Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you struggle to lose weight and think your lack of motivation stands in your way, here’s something to think about: Other issues are often at play.</p><p>Kimberly Gomer, a Miami-based registered dietitian and former director of nutrition at Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa, says that in her 25 years of practice, she has learned that motivation often isn’t the problem. Instead, Gomer says that not having the right support, education, and ability to make lifestyle and nutrition changes can result in real barriers to weight loss.</p><p>So if you want to lose weight, but think you don’t have enough motivation, see if one or more of the following factors might be holding you back.</p><h2>A Need for a Customized Plan</h2><p>In her experience working with clients, Gomer believes successful weight loss starts with meeting someone where they are. For example, she points out that a 50-year-old with diabetes who is trying to lose weight has different needs than an active 20-year-old. A person with a full-time job and young kids who doesn’t sleep well through the night will have unique needs compared to someone at a different stage of life.</p><p>The key, says Gomer, is understanding your particular requirements and finding “the right plan that matches your lifestyle and goals.” She suggests working with a professional who can help you assess what your needs are and design a plan for success. For instance, you may require quick grab-and-go meals, a plan you can customize for a family, or a gluten-free or high-protein diet plan to meet your specific nutritional needs. </p><h2>The Stress of Self-Blame</h2><p>Anne Poirier, director of behavioral health at Hilton Head Health in South Carolina, urges those who worry they aren’t “motivated” enough to lose weight to recognize how harmful the stress of self-blame can be. She points out that high levels of stress can negatively impact weight loss efforts, which is supported by a study on the impact of stress management. “Managing stress is key,” Poirer says. “Be compassionate toward yourself rather than critical and judgmental.”</p><p>Also, instead of dwelling on perceived self-failure, Poirier suggests focusing on specific behaviors that make you feel good. For instance, if a walk after dinner helps you sleep better, implement that behavior instead of telling yourself you’re too lazy to go to the gym.</p><p>“Think one day at a time,” she suggests. “What one behavior am I going to focus on and make sure I do, just for today?”</p><h2>Low-Quality Information</h2><p>Social media provides easy-to-find, affordable weight loss tips, but Gomer cautions that it can also be a frustrating and even dangerous place to find effective support. “We live in a world of social media, but unfortunately, there’s a lot of misinformation being spun,” Gomer warns. A research review supports this, concluding that online nutrition information is “often inaccurate and of low quality.”</p><p>Anyone can offer weight loss tips online and call themselves an expert. So, if you can, start by consulting with licensed professionals who specialize in any conditions you have. For instance, if you have diabetes or prediabetes, look for a nutritionist who works with diabetes. You might begin with your insurance company — many people don’t realize that their insurance covers dietitian and nutritionist visits.</p><h2>Vague Goals</h2><p>Avery Zenker, an Ontario, Canada–based registered dietitian who works with Everflex Fitness, says that overly ambitious or vague weight loss goals like “I want to eat healthy” or expectations of rapid results often lead people to frustration, thinking they don’t have what it takes to make weight loss changes.</p><p>General goals can be a great start, Zenker says, “but they’re not nearly specific enough to help you know just what to do and how to do it.” She encourages people wanting to lose weight to set specific and attainable goals with clearly defined steps to get there.</p><p>“Instead of focusing on the big picture, concentrate on taking small, achievable actions that move you closer to your goals,” says Zenker. For instance, she suggests starting with goals like:</p><ul>  <li>Drinking 32 ounces of water per day</li>  <li>Exercising three times a week</li>  <li>Taking one walk after dinner per week</li> </ul><p>“Breaking your goals down into smaller chunks can make them feel more attainable and help you regain a sense of progress and momentum,” she notes, a process supported by research on goal setting and achievement.</p><h2>Addictive Foods</h2><p>Gomer says that while many people think their inability to lose weight is their fault, that’s hardly ever the case. Instead, she urges people to understand that much of the available processed and packaged snack food in the United States is designed to be addictive, “tricking” your brain into wanting and eating more.</p><p>One research report asserted that tobacco-owned food companies — which included Nabisco and Kraft — introduced “hyper-palatable foods into the U.S. food system between 1988 and 2001.” By “hyper-palatable,” the study refers to food that has been engineered with fat and sodium, both of which have been described by some researchers as addictive when present in highly processed foods.</p><p>While tobacco companies no longer associate with food producers, the foundation of those foods — and the impact they have had on people’s diets and brains — remains. According to Gomer, understanding this can be the start of breaking the cycle. She also suggests eliminating packaged snacks and foods whenever possible and transitioning to whole foods. And remember, you don’t have to overhaul your whole diet overnight. Start with one swap, like replacing your daily breakfast bar with oatmeal or a smoothie.</p><h2>Unrealistic Expectations</h2><p>Many people go all-in at the start of a weight loss journey — but Shilpa P. Saxena, MD, chief medical officer of Forum Health in Tampa, Florida, suggests the “50 percent off” approach instead.</p><p>“Everyone loves a 50-percent-off sale,” says Dr. Saxena. “Well, you can do the same with any undesirable habit. Motivation is oftentimes built upon past successes. So, a relatively easy way to be successful is to just reduce it by 50 percent as a first goal. Eating dessert every night? Cut down your portion by one-half every night, or only eat dessert on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Once you’ve become accustomed to the 50-percent-off lifestyle, consider doing it again. You’d be surprised how quickly you can do this because you don’t have to deal with feelings of complete loss and grief.”</p><h2>Losing Sight of the Basics</h2><p>Gomer encourages working with professionals to support your weight loss journey and recommends keeping your weight loss efforts as simple as possible. For instance, she says sticking to the basics can go a long way:</p><ul>  <li>Eat whole foods (avoid packaged foods whenever possible, she notes).</li>  <li>Get plenty of sleep.</li>  <li>Take care of your mental health.</li>  <li>Reduce stress.</li>  <li>Exercise in a way that you enjoy.</li> </ul><p>Saxena also points out that it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the different methods when trying to lose weight. “Many of us have become paralyzed trying to figure out the ‘right’ way and then never actually take a first step,” she says. “We feel safe thinking we are researching, but this subtle form of avoidance is one of the biggest challenges most face.</p><p>“Truth is, little actions add up to big results,” Saxena continues. “Do what you can now, and layer on more as you can. Rarely do people succeed in a straight line, getting better and better and better until they reach the goal. In reality, people get sustainable weight loss by spiraling up. This means that you go forward two steps and may at some point take one step back. However, each time you take a step back, you’re wiser for it and make net movement forward and upward in the end.”</p><h2>Fluctuation of Motivation</h2><p>Zenker points out that while motivation can help, especially in the early days of a weight loss journey, it’s normal to not feel motivated all the time. To combat this, she suggests building sustainable habits to establish consistency.</p><p>Danielle Rancourt, RD, owner of Pivot Nutrition Coaching, based in Grand Forks, North Dakota, adds, “The problem with motivation is that it’s fleeting: It may last a few hours, a few days, or maybe a few weeks. This is why we cannot rely on motivation to be successful or lose weight … it would be like being on a never-ending roller coaster ride.”</p><p>If you’re experiencing a (normal!) slump in motivation, Zenker and Rancourt suggest doing the following:</p><ul>  <li>Reflect on your “why” for losing weight.</li>  <li>Assess what current challenges you are facing right now.</li>  <li>Find an accountability partner for specific challenges, like a workout or meal prep partner.</li>  <li>Lower the bar. “Five minutes is better than nothing,” reminds Rancourt.</li>  <li>Celebrate the successes you have already made.</li>  <li>Acknowledge non-scale victories, like having more energy or lifting heavier weights at the gym.</li> </ul><p>“Aim for progress over perfection,” Rancourt adds. “You don’t have to eat 100 percent healthy or work out every day to achieve your weight loss goals.”</p><p>Whatever path you take, Gomer urges you to not think of losing weight as solely up to you and your motivation, but as a matter of finding the specific tools you need. “The motivation is finding the right plan, the right group, support, nutritionist, or whoever and whatever it is that can really help you and support your health goals and your journey — because it really is a journey.”</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
