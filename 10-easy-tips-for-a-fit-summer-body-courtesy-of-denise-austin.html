    <main><h1>10 Easy Tips for a Fit Summer Body, Courtesy of Denise Austin</h1><p>Do you want to shape up this summer? According to fitness and health expert Denise Austin, who looks half her age at 67, all it takes is incorporating some easy healthy habits into your life. In one of her blog posts, Austin shares her "top 10 fit & sexy summer body tips" to "help you get motivated to exercise and eat right, which in turn will help you sleep better, help to boost your metabolism so you are burning more calories, help keep your energy levels up, and keep you feeling great inside and out – no matter what your age!" she writes.</p><h2>1 Get Motivated with Music</h2><p>Use music to your advantage, Austin recommends. "I find music is key to getting motivated, so I love to blast it when I work out! Make a workout playlist, but only allow yourself to listen to your new music when you work out. It'll give you something to look forward to!" she says.</p><h2>2 Give Yourself Non-Food Rewards</h2><p>Reward yourself with something other than food. "Set yourself a goal, maybe a full week of workouts or getting into a pair of pants that have been too small and when you reach that goal you get your reward!" she suggests. This could be buying yourself flowers, lighting a candle, or scheduling "me time."</p><h2>3 Find a Workout Buddy</h2><p>Finding a workout buddy is key, according to Austin. "This really helps me stick with and look forward to my workouts. Every Sunday, I pull out my calendar and call my friends to set up exercise dates for the week. I love that I can stay in shape and stay in touch with friends," she writes.</p><figure><img title="3 Find a Workout Buddy" src="IMG/BB1pRAJR_3_find_a_workout_buddy.jpg" alt="3 Find a Workout Buddy"><figcaption><em>3 Find a Workout Buddy. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Do Some Workout Prep</h2><p>Austin also recommends workout prepping. "Put your workout clothes out the night before so exercising is a no-brainer. This one really works for me, as it's one of the first things I see in the morning!" she says.</p><figure><img title="4 Do Some Workout Prep" src="IMG/BB1mQl9U_4_do_some_workout_prep.jpg" alt="4 Do Some Workout Prep"><figcaption><em>4 Do Some Workout Prep. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Use a Star System</h2><p>Many parents use star charts to reward kids, which Austin recommends trying for yourself. "Hang a calendar somewhere that you can see it often – on the refrigerator, above your computer – and put a sticker or special mark on the days you work out and eat right. Seeing evidence of your hard work will inspire you to keep it up!" she says.</p><h2>6 Make Exercise Part of Your Schedule</h2><p>"Pick a time of day that you're going to exercise and stick with it. This way it becomes part of your schedule and makes you feel more committed," Austin suggests. "It's like an oath to yourself that you won't want to break. Without some planning, your day can easily get ahead of you – that's why I get up early enough to squeeze in a workout in the morning. Then it's done with and I feel great all day!"</p><figure><img title="6 Make Exercise Part of Your Schedule" src="IMG/BB1pREWE_6_make_exercise_part_of_your_schedule.jpg" alt="6 Make Exercise Part of Your Schedule"><figcaption><em>6 Make Exercise Part of Your Schedule. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 Be Accountable</h2><p>Accountability is key, according to Austin. "Pick a close friend and e-mail your workout log to her or him each week. When you know someone else is 'watching,' you're more likely to stick with your goals," she says.</p><h2>8 Get on Your Workout Gear</h2><p>Dress the part, says Austin. "Slip on your workout clothes and don't take them off until you sweat. This goes along with tip number 4, but is one of the biggest things I do to stay motivated (yes, even I have trouble at times). The second I wake up, I put on my workout clothes and sneakers because I know that I'd be embarrassed to take them off without squeezing in a workout," she explains.</p><figure><img title="8 Get on Your Workout Gear" src="IMG/BB1pRvLs_8_get_on_your_workout_gear.jpg" alt="8 Get on Your Workout Gear"><figcaption><em>8 Get on Your Workout Gear. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Exercise While Watching TV</h2><p>"TV can be another motivator," writes Austin. "Record your favorite shows and workout while watching. I love to hop on my trampoline, AirWalker or WalkingPad and watch a favorite show while blasting some calories!! Or use the commercials to do exercise such as squats, crunches, and push-ups."</p><h2>10 Plate Your Food</h2><p>She also encourages making "healthy foods look more appetizing and thus more satisfying," by plating them. "Instead of eating yogurt out of the container, put it in a bowl and alternate layers of yogurt and fruit, or make fish and veggies more appealing by adding a garnish of mint or parsley."
