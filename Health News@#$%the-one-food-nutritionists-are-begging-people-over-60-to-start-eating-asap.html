Remember when it seemed like every restaurant was adding Brussels sprouts to the menu? Or when you couldn’t walk through the frozen food section without coming across at least five foods made with cauliflower (cauliflower pizza, tots, mashed potatoes…)? Then there’s of course the avocado toast revolution that inspired entire restaurants dedicated to the fruit. </p><p>Hey, a trend that inspires people to eat more plants is definitely a good thing, but there’s one nutrient-loaded plant-based food that nutritionists say is still being overlooked. What’s more, this food is an especially important food for people 60 and older because it’s full of nutrients many people in their 60s don’t get enough of. </p><h2>Nutrients That People in Their 60s Don’t Get Enough Of </h2><p>In a perfect world, healthy dietary habits are already in place long before someone reaches their 60s. “The reality is that you want to start with healthy eating habits from a young age so they solidify as you get older,” says registered dietitian and author <strong>Toby Amidor, MS, RD, CND</strong>. Registered dietitian <strong>Marisa Moore, RDN,</strong> adds to this, saying, “Two things are true: The risk of chronic disease increases with age. And how we eat throughout our lives has a cumulative effect.”</p><p>That said, it’s never too late to start eating healthier. Moore says that eating a well-balanced diet means eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats and high-quality protein sources. Amidor agrees, saying that MyPlate.gov is a great resource for seeing what exactly it means to put this into practice. </p><p>If you’re in your 60s, there are certain nutrients it’s important to be extra mindful to get enough of. Since muscle mass starts to decrease in your 60s, it’s critical to get enough protein. It’s recommended to get .8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. (For many people, this comes out to 75 grams or more per day.) </p><p>Additionally, it’s important to prioritize vitamin D and calcium (which are both important for bones, which become more brittle with age), potassium (important for heart health) and vitamin B12 (crucial for brain health). It’s also important to up your fiber intake as you age because the digestive system slows down as we get older and fiber helps keep it going. A high-fiber diet also protects against age-related diseases and cardiovascular mortality. </p><h2>The One Food To Eat More of if You’re 60 or Older</h2><p>There’s one food that is packed with almost all of the aforementioned nutrients that Amidor wishes everyone 60 and older would eat more of: beans. “Not only do beans provide a plant-based source of protein and excellent source of fiber, they are also inexpensive and easy to prepare,” she says. </p><p>Amidor explains that a recent scientific study found that adding about two servings of beans per day significantly increased consumption of three nutrients of concern (fiber, potassium and calcium), and showed higher intakes of several nutrients like iron, magnesium and vitamins E compared to people who did not consume beans. “In addition, those who consumed more beans had a lower body mass index, decreased body weight and improved waist circumference compared to folks who did not eat beans,” Amidor says.</p><p>Beans are good for both gut health and heart health. This is especially noteworthy for people 60 and older because the digestive system slows down with age; eating high-fiber foods can help keep things moving and protect against constipation. As for the heart health benefits, the fiber in beans (as well as the other nutrients it contains) can help lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is the number one cause of death in the U.S. “[Eating beans regularly] helps reduce cholesterol, decrease blood sugar levels and increase healthy gut bacteria,” Amidor says.</p><p>Beans aren’t the only food it’s worth eating more of in your 60s. Moore wishes people 60 and older would up their cabbage intake too. “Whether green, red or purple, cabbage is a nutrient-packed, versatile and affordable vegetable. It’s an excellent source of vitamin C and K. Plus, cabbage has anti-inflammatory properties which might help fend off some chronic conditions,” she explains.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to enjoy cabbage. “Enjoy cabbage sautéed, stuffed or raw, shredded into a crunchy salad or as a topping for tacos or wraps. It easily keeps for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator and can be used in a variety of ways from soups to salads to stir-fry,” Moore says.</p><p>Both of these recommendations make one thing clear: Dietitians want us to eat more plants as we age. By incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet—like cabbage and beans—you’ll be benefiting your entire body (including your brain, heart and gut) while lowering your risk of age-related diseases. Plant-based foods are also inexpensive, versatile and good for the environment. This is one piece of advice that will never get old! </p></main>
