Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in people over 60 years of age. All cases of Alzheimer's disease are dementia, but not all dementia cases are Alzheimer's disease. Other types of dementia include vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia.</p><h2>Symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease vs. Dementia</h2><p>Dementia is a term that describes a wide range of neurological conditions that affect your brain's ability to remember, think, and perform daily activities. Because Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia, the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and dementia are relatively the same.</p><p>The Alzheimer's Association highlights 10 common signs of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, which include:</p><ul><li>Memory loss and trouble remembering new information </li><li>Trouble planning and problem-solving</li><li>Not being able to complete familiar tasks </li><li>Losing track of times, dates, and places</li><li>Vision changes </li><li>Forgetting words or having trouble finding the correct word to use </li><li>Misplacing items </li><li>Poor decision-making skills </li><li>Withdrawing from social relationships </li><li>Emotional and behavioral changes such as rapid mood swings</li></ul><h2>Differences Between Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia</h2><p>Alzheimer's disease is just one type of dementia—though, the most common type. However, other types of dementia can affect your cognitive health a bit differently. Some of the primary differences are highlighted below.</p><h3>Alzheimer's Disease Affects The Brain Differently</h3><p>While other forms of dementia might share some similarities in symptoms, the underlying changes in the brain in Alzheimer's disease are more distinctive and tend to follow a specific pattern of progression.</p><p>In Alzheimer's disease, the brain develops clumps of abnormal proteins—called beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles—that make it hard for brain cells to communicate with each other. Beta-amyloid plaques form outside of your nerve cells, while tau protein forms tangles inside the cells. This causes the cells to die, especially in areas of your brain that are responsible for memory and thinking, which leads to problems with remembering things and thinking clearly.</p><h3>There are Several Other Types of Dementia</h3><p>Although Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, there are several other types that you can develop. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Vascular dementia: </strong>This type occurs when brain conditions (such as a stroke) damage your brain tissue and affect blood flow to the brain. People with vascular dementia typically have brain abnormalities that are visible on an MRI scan, such as diseased small blood vessels or "white matter" changes that make it difficult for your nerve cells to communicate with each other. Symptoms of vascular dementia may include difficulty with thinking, reasoning, behavior, and memory.</li><li><strong>Lewy body dementia (LBD): </strong>LBD develops when there is a presence of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, known as Lewy bodies. The cause of LBD is often unclear, however, risk factors include older age and some underlying health conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. Symptoms of this type of dementia often include changes in thinking, mobility, behavior, and emotional states.</li><li><strong>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD): </strong>FTD affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which play a role in your personality, behavior, emotions, and language. This type of dementia often occurs at a younger age than other types of dementia. There is often no clear cause for FTD. However, research shows the presence of abnormal proteins, known as tau or TDP-43, in the affected brain regions of people who have FTD. People with a family history of FTD also tend to have a higher risk of this condition than those without a family history.</li><li><strong>Mixed dementia: </strong>Sometimes, people can have more than one type of dementia at the same time. For example, someone might have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, which can complicate symptoms and diagnosis.</li></ul><h3>Different Types of Dementia Can Start at Different Ages</h3><p>Most people with Alzheimer's disease develop the condition in their mid-60s or later. This is referred to as "late-onset." However, Alzheimer's disease can also be "early onset," affecting people younger than 65 years old.</p><p>However, frontotemporal dementia is a less common form of dementia that often manifests at an earlier age than other types. Approximately 60% of people who live with this condition receive a diagnosis between 45 and 64 years old.</p><p>Additionally, Lewy body dementia affects people 50 years or older. But sometimes LBD can develop when you are younger. This type of dementia also tends to affect a slightly higher proportion of people assigned male at birth as compared to assigned females.</p><h2>Similarities Between Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia</h2><p>Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia. That said, there are definitely commonalities between Alzheimer's and other types of dementia.</p><h3>Healthcare Providers Use Similar Diagnostic Tests for All Dementia Types</h3><p>If you or a loved one are experiencing symptoms of dementia, it's important to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible to get the care you or your loved one need. Early diagnosis can help you get started on treatment early and slow the progression of the disease. Once you see a provider, they can diagnose the type of dementia you have using the following methods:</p><ul><li>Taking a thorough medical history and asking about your symptoms</li><li>Performing a physical exam</li><li>Assessing your cognitive functions, including your thinking, memory, and language skills</li><li>Using additional diagnostic exams like blood tests and genetic testing</li><li>Ordering brain imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET)</li><li>Conducting a mental health evaluation to determine if any mental health conditions might be influencing your symptoms</li></ul><h3>All Types of Dementia are Progressive</h3><p>All types of dementia are progressive, meaning they worsen over time as the brain experiences more damage and deterioration. This progression usually leads to a decline in cognitive function and a worsening of symptoms.</p><p>However, the rate and manner of progression can vary among different types of dementia and from person to person. Some people might progress more slowly, while others might have a more rapid decline. However, nearly all types of dementia tend to result in a progressive decline in thinking and memory abilities.</p><p>While there is no cure for dementia and Alzheimer's disease at this time, the goal of treatment is to slow the progression of the disease. Healthcare providers often use medications to slow down the disease and enhance memory. However, medication is mostly helpful for people who are in an early stage of dementia.</p><p>Your healthcare provider can also prescribe specific medications that target symptoms like anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and muscle stiffness associated with certain types of dementia.</p><p>It is important to note that some drugs may pose significant side effects for people with dementia. That said, it's crucial to discuss with your healthcare provider which medications are safe and suitable for your condition.</p><p>Other treatments for all types of dementia include:</p><ul><li>Occupational therapy to simplify daily tasks and activities</li><li>Speech therapy to help with speaking and communication</li><li>Psychotherapy and mental health counseling for people with dementia and their families to support them with emotional management, behavioral strategies, and future planning</li></ul><h2>Can You Have Both Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease?</h2><p>Alzheimer's disease is a specific type of dementia, making it possible for an individual to have both dementia and Alzheimer's. However, if you have a different type of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, you typically do not have Alzheimer's disease. The only way to have Alzheimer's disease and another type of dementia is when you have mixed dementia.</p><h2>When To Seek Care and Who to Contact</h2><p>If you or a loved one notices forgetfulness or starts having issues with thinking, problem-solving, or reasoning, it is a good idea to see your healthcare provider for further guidance. Start by visiting your primary care provider. If needed, your primary care doctor can guide you in finding an appropriate specialist.</p><p>For a dementia diagnosis, your provider will typically work with neurologists (doctors who specialize in brain and nervous system disorders) or geriatric psychiatrists (doctors who specialize in brain disorders and mental health conditions among older adults).</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Dementia is an umbrella that describes a group of symptoms that cause a progressive decline in your memory, thinking, reasoning, and daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease, a specific type of dementia, is the most common cause of dementia. It is important to note that while all Alzheimer's cases fall under dementia, not all instances of dementia are Alzheimer's disease specifically.</p><p>While symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia can look similar, there are key differences. If you or a loved one experiences symptoms of dementia or Alzheimer's disease, it's good practice to see your healthcare provider to understand the cause of your symptoms, receive a proper diagnosis, and get started on treatment.</p></main>
