Everyone has their own preferences, characteristics, and attributes they are attracted to, and not everyone is looking for one specific body type. And just as well — wouldn't our world be utterly boring if we were all exactly the same? That said, science does indicate that, generally speaking, straight men tend to find one particular body type the most attractive. And unsurprisingly, it all boils down to survival of the fittest.</p><p>Back when humans were still spear-hunting wild boars and living in caves, the most attractive partner was the one who would help perpetuate their genes. As Darwin put it in 1871's "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex," sexual selection (or what we find attractive in others) is "the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex and species, in exclusive relation to reproduction." As fuller-bodied women with large breasts and hourglass figures are thought to be better candidates for reproducing healthy offspring, they tend to be naturally attractive to straight members of the opposite sex, per a 2006 study published in Eye on Psi Chi.</p><p>Despite the science, we champion body positivity and are fervent advocates of each person embracing their own unique body and appearance. Plus, the "ideal women's body type" has evolved with the trends throughout the years, from the 1950s hourglass to '90s supermodel-thin. Rather than trying to keep up with trends or research, embracing your natural body and focusing on health rather than looks is the true path to confidence and beauty. </p><h2>Research Studies Suggest That Men Prefer Women With A Lower Waist-To-Hip Ratio</h2><figure><img title="Photo By Alex Tihonov/Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1pyExC_woman_looking_at_herself_in_mirror.jpg" alt="Woman looking at herself in mirror"><figcaption><em>Woman looking at herself in mirror.

Biologically, as women enter the reproductive stages of their lives, their hips widen, and more fat is deposited around the buttocks and upper thighs due to sexual reproductive hormones. To our Stone Age ancestors, wider hips signaled optimal health for successful child-bearing.</p><p>Meanwhile, a 2020 study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science provides further support for the waist-to-hip ratio theory. During a speed-dating experiment, participants indicated that women with narrow waists and wider hips were considered to be more attractive. Wondering what that exact ratio is? A 2002 study published in Evolution and Human Behavior suggests that the preferred waist-to-hip ratio, according to the participants, was 0.7. Per Medical News Today, the healthy ratio for women is 0.85 and less (Pro tip: you can exercise your way to bigger hips if you so desire).</p><p>If we are to accept that women with wider hips are more attractive because our primitive brains are wired to choose mates that can reproduce healthy children, should that change when participants are not interested in having any heirs? Interestingly, results from a 2012 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior indicated that men who wanted to remain child-free showed a preference for women with <em>smaller</em> breasts and a <em>larger</em> waist-to-hip ratio! So the adage "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" does ring true! </p><h2>Men Prefer Women With A Low-To-Medium BMI</h2><figure><img title="JLco Julia Amaral/Shutterstock" src="IMG/BB1pyq37_woman_smiling_with_drink_bottle.jpg" alt="Woman smiling with drink bottle"><figcaption><em>Woman smiling with drink bottle. JLco Julia Amaral/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure><p>Science suggests that, in general, straight men not only prefer women with wider hips and smaller waists, but also women with a low-to-medium BMI (body mass index). A 2020 study published in the British Journal of Psychology indicated that the male participants preferred the pictures of women with a healthy BMI of around 23 (based on app-generated pictures) as opposed to women with a BMI that would be considered "underweight." Unsurprisingly, when the female participants were asked to guess which BMI men preferred, they overestimated the thinness. However, 2023 research published in Personality and Individual Differences found that men in "well-nourished" cultures do tend to prefer the look of women with a low BMI, despite understanding that this actually indicates poorer health and fertility than a healthier BMI. </p><p>Regardless of what men find attractive (which is far from the be-all-and-end-all), it can be helpful to take note of what a healthy BMI is for your demographic. Per Healthline, a healthy BMI for white, Black, and Hispanic people is between 18.5 and 24.9. According to Joslin Diabetes Center, a healthy BMI for Asian and Asian Americans is 18.5 and 22.9. However, your BMI is not always giving you the full picture of your health, so it's best to check in with a health professional for a more accurate analysis.</p></main>
