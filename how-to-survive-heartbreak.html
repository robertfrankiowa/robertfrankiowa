It was, of course, the month that the UK went into lockdown, and what we all thought (hoped) was going to last three weeks turned into two years of darkness, fear and uncertainty. I remember it for another reason – my 16-year relationship ended the week lockdown began and I was left with a seven-year-old daughter who we had adopted a few months previously. </p><p>When you adopt a child the advice is to keep your life “small” for the first six months. Keep it low-key, establish yourself as a unit and get used to not only being parents but also to dealing with the emotional rollercoaster that understandably comes with a child who has left her previous life and moved in with two strangers; a child who is grieving so seriously that hour-long rages, during which she would trash her room and throw things at me, occurred four or five times a week. </p><p>So it was early days in our new shrunk-to-fit life when lockdown hit and three became two… and a dog. I was in 24/7 shock. I think I went into pure autopilot – as did many of us. I was running my own business as the world shut down: there was an office to exit, a team to manage, clients to help, bills, a mortgage, a relationship split, dealing with social workers and, of course, giving a frightened little girl a home while being a rookie mum. </p><p>As reality set in and lockdown moved from three weeks to “indefinite”, I realised I was going to have to dig deep. Completely on my own with a seven-year-old and a dog, I couldn’t pull any of my usual “bounce back” tricks out of the hat, like sinking a bottle of wine with girlfriends, a haircut or – possibly most importantly for me – travel. This time I couldn’t escape in the car or on a train to help get some perspective. How could I keep going? Crumbling and hiding under the duvet, crying for a day, or even an hour, was not an option. I had a brave little girl hoping for a settled, safe new life – so I needed to find new ways to build my strength. </p><p>There were things I didn’t do. I didn’t drink. There had been a lot of addiction in my daughter’s early life, so there was no alcohol at all in my flat. I didn’t rant or cry on the phone (little ears listening). I worked, sometimes starting at 5am to get a couple of hours in before breakfast, and I spoke to my long-time therapist once a week. I practised gratitude (being grateful for three things every morning really does boost the spirits) and I read about a “reframe”. Instead of saying “I <em>have</em> to do something”, I would say “I <em>get</em> to do the bed and bath routine”. It’s powerful. And I walked. My daughter was classed as a vulnerable child so she was at school for part of lockdown, and my twice-daily solo dog walks during that time became the highlights of my day. It was on these that I began my new addiction to audio books and, I suppose, an exploration of resilience. I consulted the experts and this is what I learnt.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">It takes time to build resilience but it’s possible for everyone</h2><p>Resilience, I discovered, is not a trait reserved for the privileged few. Rather, it’s something that can be cultivated and honed and it can help you survive pretty much anything. </p><p>The NeuroSuccess coach and TranceFormations founder Marilyn Devonish was sexually abused as a child but can “now talk about it as easily as ‘How’s the weather?’ because I have done the work on myself”.</p><p>“The definition of resilience,” Devonish says, “is your ability to absorb high levels of disruption, change and trauma and have the ability to bounce back. It’s also about how to have the ability to deal with uncertainty.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Every day is better when it has a structure</h2><p>Award-winning coach James Davis, co-founder of The Midlife Mentors, believes structure and routine can be a key first step to getting through hard times. As he explains, our subconscious wants to feel that everything is safe and in some ways predictable. “This is why Covid was such a challenge because the perceived certainty of life was washed away,” he says. “I say ‘perceived’ because, of course, nothing in life is certain. So when we have these stressful situations, our subconscious, through trying to bring us back to a place of safety, can feel overwhelmed.” </p><p>Building resilience, he explains, involves planning, prioritising and setting routines that allow the subconscious a perceived level of certainty. “Once people start building an action plan, they start to feel a lot better.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Remember that crises often <em>do</em> come all at once</h2><p>Difficult times have a tendency to hit us all in one go: a bereavement, a house move, a lost job. According to a study by the University of Sydney, people take an average of four years to emotionally recover from major financial losses or health shocks. Like me, Devonish experienced her own perfect storm of crises, which led to a new career as a therapist and coach. </p><p>“I started a new job and had an NHS treatment go horribly wrong,” she says. “I went from a size 8 to a size 16 and had problems with my heart and kidneys. Then I discovered that my partner was cheating on me. One of those things on its own is enough to break someone, but together they were like a juggernaut. I contemplated suicide and called the Samaritans. The following year I became a Samaritan.” </p><p>And while multiple crises can feel very personal, it is fairly normal and, says counsellor Georgina Sturmer, it’s important to reframe this as part of life. “We’re always only one phone call away from disaster. All it takes is that knock on the door. Life is so fragile.” So having the tools to tackle whatever life throws at us is more than desirable – it’s essential.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">You have to face up to grief and get moving</h2><p>Sadly grief will affect us all, and research is unearthing how deeply and broadly it can affect us. People who have suffered the sudden unexpected death of a family member or friend have a 14.3 per cent chance of developing PTSD. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD, also known as complicated grief) is a condition that usually affects one in 10 people in the UK, but Covid has made this worse. Three in 10 in a sample of those bereaved from March 2020-January 2021 were found to have the disorder more than two years after their loss. </p><p>According to Anita Guru, a life coach, “Grief doesn’t always go away. It’s a trauma that gets stored in your body. And then when you experience another grief, you’re not just experiencing that grief, but all the other losses you’ve experienced.”</p><p>Guru lost one parent at 16 and the other at 28, then lost her sister-in-law in 2023. “This time I consciously allowed myself to feel everything. I had to let it all out and there were moments where I felt like I was losing my mind, but if I held it in, it would be like a poison that stays with me,” she says.</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1jK6TI_counsellor_georgina_sturmer_advises_taking_30_minutes_at_the_beginning_of_the_day_to_get_into_the_right_m.jpg" alt="Counsellor Georgina Sturmer advises taking 30 minutes at the beginning of the day to get into the right mindframe"><figcaption><em>Counsellor Georgina Sturmer advises taking 30 minutes at the beginning of the day to get into the right frame of mind - Olga Rolenko.

Guru explains: “When we are weighed down with emotion, we tend to sit on the sofa and do nothing, and that keeps everything in the body. It’s got nowhere to go. So just getting up and going for a walk, or even moving around the room, helps your emotions start to move. They don’t get stuck and stagnant.” </p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Take a step back from the problem no matter how big it is</h2><p>We’ve all heard that divorce and or moving house can be two of the most stressful events of your life. Right now divorce is at an eight-year high in England and Wales, and 28 per cent of people in midlife experience depression following their divorce. One in three married people reports being lonely, 51 per cent have increased feelings of loneliness after divorce (according to a 2018 AARP National Survey) and many experience added money worries.</p><p>Likewise In a study of 2,000 adults who have gone through moving house, 60 per cent found the experience “stressful” while 40 per cent were frustrated as many aspects were out of their control. </p><p>Looking after yourself is essential when living through extreme stress. “Food is mood,” says Guru. “If you eat well, you feel well. And sleep is key.”  </p><p>“In terms of feeling overwhelmed, try to step back and break a problem down,” adds James Davis. “Force yourself to think: ‘what is the root of it? What steps can I take around it?” Sturmer advises taking 30 minutes at the beginning of the day to get into the right mindframe: “Perhaps a little bit more time in the shower, when you can pause and think about what you want for the day ahead. There’s something really critical about that part of the day.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Choose optimism</h2><p>The stress of losing your job, or your business being on the brink of collapse, can be both terrifying and overwhelming. According to a 2023 survey, 41 per cent of small and medium-sized business owners said financial worries are having the single biggest impact on their mental health. And redundancy can have as great an impact: job-seeking is more stressful than getting a divorce, moving house or sitting exams, according to a 2021 survey by job site Indeed.</p><p>Sturmer suggests that when it comes to work matters, what can help is to embrace the challenges fully – “the sadness, the loss, the joy: everything that makes us human, which helps us to understand what we need, and to be able to bounce back, reflect, and make better choices in the future. Ask yourself: ‘OK, what have I learned? What would I maybe do differently next time so that I don’t get caught in difficult relationships or situations where I buckled?’</p><figure><img title="Provided by The Telegraph" src="IMG/BB1jK2Gi_neurosuccess_coach_marilyn_devonish_advises_that_even_30_seconds_of_breathing_can_make_a_difference.jpg" alt="NeuroSuccess coach Marilyn Devonish advises that 'even 30 seconds of breathing can make a difference'"><figcaption><em>NeuroSuccess coach Marilyn Devonish advises that 'even 30 seconds of breathing can make a difference' - Yana Iskayeva. Provided by The Telegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>“There’s a lot to just believing that things are going to be OK. Just having that kind of optimistic outlook makes you open to enjoying small things. It encourages us to connect and see ourselves as part of a universe where special things happen and beauty exists.” Davis adds: “Research shows that optimists experience better life outcomes than pessimists, so why not choose to be more optimistic?” </p><p>And the one simple “tool” that everyone can do to help them make the first step through a difficult time? “Breathe,” says Devonish. “When I have clients who are so stressed they can’t move, who say they have got no time, no money, I say, ‘Become aware of your breathing, sit for 30 seconds and breathe.’ When our breath is relaxed, we tap into the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the body’s natural relaxation response. Even 30 seconds of breathing can make a difference and calm us sufficiently to take that next step forward.” </p><p><em>Recommended</em></p><p>'I used to be a sceptic, but now I know mindfulness really works'</p></main>
