Provided by Lose It!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many people want to lose weight for aesthetic reasons. (Does the phrase “summer body” ring a bell?) Yet you could have other valid reasons for wanting to lose weight — perhaps a medical condition or something more personal.</p><p>Regardless, as long as you’re working with your doctor and plan to lose weight in a healthy, sustainable way, weight loss can bring many benefits to your life. Here’s a look at seven that might surprise you.</p><h2>1. Improved Energy With Less Pain</h2><p>Derek Lipton, RD, a board certified specialist in sports dietetics and sports nutrition consultant for Bodybuilding Reviews, says many of his clients feel better physically after losing weight, experiencing “more energy, less pain, and less illness.” In some instances, even chronic pain can decrease after weight loss, according to research.</p><p>New ways of eating can also stabilize your energy levels. Erin Renzas, author and founder of EBB Wellness, lost 102 pounds through diet and exercise, and says after she began to track her food, she discovered that certain foods made her energy crash in the afternoon while others didn’t. The reason? Eating too many high-glycemic foods such as white rice, pasta, or refined breakfast cereals can spike blood sugar and eventually lead energy levels to crash, per the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. This can be managed by eating more low- to medium-glycemic foods such as peanuts, oatmeal, and whole-grain breads instead.</p><h2>2. Less Bias in Healthcare</h2><p>One review published in <em>Primary Health Care Research and Development</em> found that many healthcare providers demonstrate weight bias against higher-weight patients — a known and systemic problem across all specialties. When such a patient has other health conditions apart from obesity, their concerns are often ignored, misdiagnosed, or dismissed altogether. This can affect how patients seek treatment and thus how they manage their overall healthcare. While the responsibility for this bias ultimately lies with the providers, losing weight may unintentionally change your experience at the doctor’s office.</p><h2>3. Willingness to Engage in New Activities</h2><p>Many people on a weight loss journey may decide to engage in new or increased forms of physical activity. Phyllis Pobee, MD, a board certified physician in weight loss and obesity medicine, says that as people lose weight, they often start participating in hobbies and activities they used to avoid. Renzas, for example, took up strength training and boxing — activities she continues to this day.</p><p>This can affect your quality of life in big ways, leading to “better social connections and a more fulfilling social life,” says Dr. Pobee. Not only that, but these improved relationships may also help you maintain your weight loss over time, according to research.</p><h2>4. Freedom of Movement</h2><p>Especially as we get older, having an overweight or obese BMI is a known risk factor for developing problems with activities of daily living (ADLs). These can include seemingly simple things like getting dressed or bathing, according to one study. For this reason, losing weight can give some people a sense of physical freedom.</p><p>One big sign of improved mobility is “getting up from the ground with ease,” according to Trevor Buccieri, founder, CEO, and president of The Stay Young Center for Women and author of <em>Fit Mind + Fit Body = Fit Life</em>. As someone who has lost 70 pounds himself, Buccier points out that being able to move your body more easily provides a new outlook on life, increasing your confidence and range of experiences.</p><h2>5. Better Sleep</h2><p>Pobee says that many of her patients experience a “dramatic improvement in sleep quality after losing weight, which collectively enhances their overall quality of life.” A study in the <em>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</em> also shows that moderate weight loss can help improve sleep outcomes and reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.</p><h2>6. Increased Libido</h2><p>While not everyone will experience a sudden surge in libido with weight loss, Pobee says that many of her patients who have lost weight are pleasantly surprised by the improvement in their sex lives. According to a study by the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Surgery</em>, females, especially those under the age of 40, show an improvement in sexual satisfaction after losing a significant amount of weight.</p><p>This is due to several factors, says Pobee. “Weight loss can lead to improved physical stamina, increased self-confidence, and changes in hormone levels, all of which can contribute to a better sexual experience. It’s an intimate yet important benefit that underscores the holistic impact of weight loss on one’s personal life and relationships.”</p><h2>7. A New Sense of Self</h2><p>Renzas believes weight loss can “reset your relationship” with your body as it relates to your sense of identity and self. For instance, once she decided that a smaller body wouldn’t necessarily make her happy or more lovable, she says her mindset changed. “I finally stopped blaming my bigger body for things that weren’t good in my life,” she notes. “When I did that, I was able to embrace true self-love and self-acceptance — one where I learned to love my bigger body, my smaller body, and whatever body I will have in the future.”</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking </p></main>
