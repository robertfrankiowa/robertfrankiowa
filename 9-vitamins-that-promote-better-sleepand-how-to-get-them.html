Provided by Real Simple</em></figcaption></figure><p>Consistent, restful sleep is a major cornerstone to our overall health, helping the body to recover and regenerate. But, with increasingly busy schedules, elevated stress levels, and excessive screen usage, this ideal is getting harder and harder to achieve. And while simple hacks like using blue blockers in the evening and maintaining a regular bedtime routine are certainly helpful, food choices can make a huge impact on sleep health.</p><p>In fact, evidence-based research has linked a handful of vitamins to improved sleep. And although there are plenty of other nutrients (like minerals and amino acids) that also elicit this effect, here we’ll focus just on sleep-supporting vitamins. So, follow along to learn what these vitamins are (and delicious foods that deliver them) to start improving your sleep health ASAP!</p><h2>9 Vitamins That Support Sleep Health</h2><p>Here are the nine vitamins that are scientifically proven to help you sleep better.</p><h2>Vitamin A</h2><p>While vitamin A is often linked to optimal eye health and immune function, evidence reveals that it may have a hand in improving sleep as well. A 2022 paper published in <em>Frontiers in Nutrition</em> found that retinoic acid (the active form of vitamin A in the body) may impact circadian rhythms through binding to retinoic acid receptors in the circadian feedback loop. This means that vitamin A might positively influence healthy sleep patterns. Foods high in vitamin A include eggs, dark leafy greens like spinach and Swiss chard, and orange-colored produce like carrots, butternut squash, mango, and papaya.</p><h2>Vitamin B1</h2><p>Vitamin B1, also known as thiamin, has also been found to encourage better sleep given that one of the primary symptoms of thiamin deficiency is sleep disturbance. But, interestingly enough, this 2024 study and 2022 study both found low thiamin levels to actually be associated with <em>over</em>sleeping. While some people could only dream of having this issue, oversleeping is nearly as inconvenient and unsupportive of a productive day as undersleeping. To help you maintain adequate levels of this vitamin, reach for lean meats, seafood, legumes, and fortified whole grains like brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and whole wheat bread.</p><h2>Vitamin B6</h2><p>Vitamin B6 facilitates a more peaceful night’s sleep through helping to tackle ancillary concerns that impact our ability to catch some Zs. “Vitamin B6 is associated with improved mental health, resulting in better overall sleep,” says Amy Davis, RDN. B6 also targets irritating restless leg syndrome (RLS) symptoms that keep many Americans awake at night. This 2022 randomized control trial found vitamin B6 supplementation to help alleviate RLS symptoms at night, promoting better sleep quality. Vitamin B6-rich foods include chickpeas, lean meats, seafood, bananas, potatoes, and whole grains.</p><h2>Vitamin B9</h2><p>Most commonly known as folate, vitamin B9 may also help you get some much needed shut eye. This is primarily due to this B complex vitamin’s role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, including serotonin and melatonin—both of which are key regulators of the sleep-wake cycle. This means that low folate levels can put us at risk for sleep troubles, like difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Some delicious options for increasing your folate intake include spinach, beans, peas, whole grains, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, lettuce, avocado, broccoli, seafood, and eggs.</p><h2>Vitamin B12</h2><p>“Vitamin B12 is involved in melatonin production, a hormone that regulates sleep,” says Davis. However, the research on this vitamin is a bit all over the place. Some studies, like this 2023 study conducted in Greece, have found low B12 levels to be associated with insomnia and overall sleepiness throughout the day. However, other studies, like this one from 2022, found high levels of B12 to actually be tied to increased risk of insomnia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Whereas a 2023 randomized control trial found B12 supplementation to have no impact on sleep quality in healthy adults. Given this information, aiming for the recommended daily intake (RDI) of B12 (and not more!) for your demographic may, at best, help you sleep better, and, at worse, benefit your overall health. Seafood, lean meats, nutritional yeast, dairy, and eggs are all excellent sources of B12.</p><h2>Vitamin C</h2><p>Though vitamin C has long been associated with boosting immune health, it may also improve your sleep hygiene. “Observational research suggests higher levels of Vitamin C are associated with longer, more restful sleep,” explains Davis. This is illustrated in this 2024 paper published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, and this 2020 review. Excellent sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, berries, bell peppers, kiwi, broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, kale, potatoes, and melon.</p><h2>Vitamin D</h2><p>Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent across the northern hemisphere, and may very well be a key piece of the puzzle when it comes to widespread sleep challenges. “Low vitamin D is associated with various sleep disorders,” says Davis. “Research suggests vitamin D supplementation may decrease the time it takes to fall asleep, improve sleep quality, and help you stay asleep longer because of the vitamin’s role in the body’s sleep-wake cycle,” she adds. This is highlighted in this 2019 analysis, this 2020 study, and this 2022 review. Plus, vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to obstructive sleep apnea, another common cause for poor sleep quality. Stepping out in the sunshine for five to 30 minutes per day or consuming seafood, fortified dairy, and fish oil are all great ways to meet your daily vitamin D requirements.</p><h2>Vitamin E</h2><p>Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that offers potent antioxidant properties, but it may also help to ensure a restful night’s sleep as a neuroprotective agent. This effect was found in this 2015 review and a 2023 randomized control trial, both conducted in postmenopausal women – though these results can reasonably be extrapolated to all adults. Vitamin E is found in spinach, avocado, nuts, seeds, wheat germ, broccoli, bell peppers, eggs, and asparagus.</p><h2>Vitamin K</h2><p>And finally, research indicates that vitamin K may also improve sleep quality. Two studies outlining this benefit include this 2019 analysis, and 2023 study. However, more evidence is needed surrounding this particular vitamin. Regardless, adequate intake of vitamin K promotes healthy blood clotting and bone formation, as an important micronutrient in a balanced diet. Foods rich in this crucial nutrient include lettuce, spinach, kale, broccoli, collard greens, blueberries, eggs, and asparagus.</p><h2>How Much of These Vitamins Should You Aim For?</h2><p>So, how much of each of these sleep-promoting vitamins should you be looking to consume on a daily basis to reap these bedtime benefits? While there are specific RDIs for each vitamin depending on age, sex, and other extenuating circumstances, it’s best to keep things simple with this many vitamins to keep track of.</p><p>Ideally, try to include at least one food source of three to four of these vitamins in your daily routine (bonus points if you can include more, and do so at dinnertime). Thankfully, this isn’t too much of a lift given that many foods are rich in several of our highlighted vitamins.</p><p>However, if you follow a restricted diet or don’t feel you consume enough fruits, veggies, or other sleep vitamin-rich foods, a multivitamin might be a good option. When searching for a multivitamin, look for brands containing no more than 100 percent of the RDI for any given vitamin or mineral, so as not to overdo it with the nutrients you’ll obtain from other foods throughout the day. Third-party verification is another excellent way to choose an effective supplement. NSF and U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) are two reputable third-party supplement verifiers. </p><p>Though, be sure to speak to your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or sleep-promoting lifestyle changes.</p><h2>Nutrients to Avoid For Better Sleep</h2><p>On the other side of the coin, there are also some nutrients that we want to avoid prior to bedtime for the best night’s rest possible. Three of these include alcohol, caffeine, and added sugar. These nutrients tend to be brain-stimulating substances—the opposite of what we’re looking to cultivate prior to a restful night’s sleep.</p><p>“To optimize sleep, avoid coffee after noon. Choose herbal teas instead of black or green teas, and avoid chocolate, added sugar, and alcohol before bed,” says Davis. </p><p>While you want to steer clear of potent caffeine sources like caffeinated tea and coffee by the early afternoon, avoiding alcohol and added sugar two to three hours before bedtime should make a meaningful impact.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Finding a solution to sleep troubles can be a frustrating challenge for many of us. Thankfully, there are so many lifestyle alterations we can make to improve our sleep health, just one of which is opting for foods rich in vitamins proven to promote restful sleep. Through including more foods rich in these vitamins and avoiding stimulating foods prior to bedtime, we can move towards more optimal sleep, regaining newfound energy during the day.</p></main>
