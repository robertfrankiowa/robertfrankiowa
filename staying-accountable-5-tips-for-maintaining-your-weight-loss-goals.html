That’s where the power of accountability can come into play and help you reach the finish line.</p><p>“Accountability helps someone stay on track and responsible for their actions, behaviors, and outcomes,” says Michelle Routhenstein, RD, CDCES, a New York City–based preventive cardiology nutritionist at Entirely Nourished. “When it comes to weight loss, accountability can help someone stay on track to meet their health and weight loss goals.”</p><p>A number of strategies and tools can help keep you accountable to your goals. Here are five tips to help you along the way.</p><h2>1. Define Your ‘Why’ and Create a Plan of Action</h2><p>Before starting your weight loss journey, it’s important to be honest with yourself and understand why you’re making these changes, says Elizabeth Simkus, DNP, medical director of the Rush Prevention Center at Rush University System for Health in Chicago and an expert in lifestyle medicine.</p><p>Many people find their motivation in avoiding chronic health problems like type 2 diabetes, she notes, while others want to lose weight so they can travel or be actively involved in their children’s or grandchildren’s lives.</p><p>“It’s easy for lifestyle changes to veer off track when things come up in life, but if we keep going back to our ‘why,’ it can help us to get back on track more quickly,” Dr. Simkus says.</p><p>Once you establish why you want to lose weight, developing a plan of action will provide a roadmap to help you achieve success. Simkus recommends setting SMART goals. According to the Cleveland Clinic, SMART goals are:</p><ul>  <li>S = specific</li>  <li>M = measurable</li>  <li>A = achievable</li>  <li>R = relevant</li>  <li>T = time-based</li> </ul><p>“When I ask patients to set a goal, they commonly say, ‘I want to lose X amount of weight in the next month,’” she says. “We then tease this out to set a SMART goal by exploring what they would need to tweak or change in their lifestyle to achieve that goal. Examples include ‘I will not eat after 7 p.m. over the next four weeks’ or ‘I will eat at least two servings of vegetables per day, three times per week, over the next four weeks.’”</p><h2>2. Track Your Progress</h2><p>Tracking your habit changes, including exercise, dietary intake, and stress levels, can help keep you accountable to your goals and lead to weight loss.</p><p>A study of 171 people with either type 2 diabetes or prediabetes found that those who were actively engaged with tracking their progress in a nutrition app had the greatest overall weight reduction of 10.6 percent of their baseline weight after six months.</p><p>A number of tools can help you track your progress, including pen and paper, a digital spreadsheet, and digital apps like Lose It!</p><h2>3. Team Up With a Weight Loss Buddy</h2><p>Research shows social support can contribute largely to the achievement of weight loss goals. One study of 194 adults (predominantly women) categorized with an overweight or obese body mass index (BMI) divided participants into two groups with different weight management strategies — either taking part in group sessions and seminars or receiving dietary counseling. Participants who joined the group sessions saw a 6 percent weight loss, compared to a 4.1 percent weight loss for the ones who received dietary counseling.</p><p>“Accountability partners can take many forms,” Simkus says. “Many of my patients have found success with group texting with family members, taking part in health challenges at work, and visiting with me, their health coach. They’ve also found online support groups and weight loss programs.”</p><p>However, be mindful that whoever helps you along your weight loss journey should have your best interests in mind and come from a place of support, advises Jackson Haen, RD, CSCS, a sports dietitian at Memorial Hermann | Rockets Sports Medicine Institute in Houston.</p><p>“People who criticize your choices in food, effort in the gym, or image as a form of ‘accountability’ can cause negative relationships with food, exercise, and yourself,” he says. “Those who encourage your efforts, little wins, and even actively participate in your change are the types of accountability [partners] you should seek.”</p><h2>4. Enlist the Help of a Professional</h2><p>Whether it’s your primary care doctor, a registered dietitian, health coach, or personal trainer, working with a professional can help keep you accountable to your weight loss goals.</p><p>One study of 1,432 adults who were either overweight or had obesity looked at the effects of working with a health coach on weight loss during a six-month program. The researchers found that attending one-on-one coaching sessions, participating in live expert-led web-based classes, and receiving feedback on food diaries were associated with a higher level of weight loss.</p><p>Kimberly Gomer, a Miami–based registered dietitian nutritionist and former director of nutrition at Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa, says a professional can be particularly helpful in keeping you motivated and accountable when you’re feeling discouraged.</p><p>“Ironically, my clients love to check in with a consult when they are doing well,” she says. “On the other hand, when they are struggling, they tend to avoid me out of fear or shame. It is exactly then that they need more nonjudgmental support and accountability in order to learn from mistakes, make adjustments to their plan, or just feel less alone in their journey.”</p><h2>5. Celebrate Your Milestones</h2><p>The road to weight loss success is challenging and can come with many ups and downs. Celebrating your achievements can help reinforce positive behaviors and continue to motivate you to stay on track, Routhenstein says. Avoid using food as a reward and instead make time for something you enjoy, such as indulging in a bubble bath, spending time in nature, reading your favorite book, or having a game night with family.</p><p>And it’s important to pay attention to <em>all</em> of your victories, not just the ones that show up on the scale.</p><p>“Remember, just because weight loss is the goal doesn’t mean that weight is the only milestone to celebrate,” Haen says. “Attending every group class for a week, eating at home instead of getting fast food, or meeting your daily step/activity goal are all milestones worth celebrating. Consistent little wins over time lead to success.”</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>The path to achieving your weight loss goals can be fraught with challenges, but accountability tools like SMART goals, habit-tracking apps, and professional help can offer a ton of support along your health journey. Importantly, remember to be kind to yourself as you adapt to new habits.</p><p>“Stay flexible and adaptable — this is a lifestyle change and you don’t have to be perfect to achieve optimal results,” Routhenstein says. “Seek professional help as needed to help guide you, support you, and keep you accountable to your health and wellness goals.”</p><p>Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
