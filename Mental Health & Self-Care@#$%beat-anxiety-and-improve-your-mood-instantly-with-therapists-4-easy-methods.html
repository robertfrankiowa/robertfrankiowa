    <main><h1>Beat anxiety and improve your mood 'instantly' with therapist's 4 easy methods</h1><p><strong>Anxiety can be crippling. Not only does it take a toll on your mental health, but often manifests into physical symptoms.</strong></p><p>In some, anxiety can cause panic attacks, which is possible to ‘break’ in 4 easy steps. However, if bouts of anxiety are coming in the way of life, a therapist demonstrates simple exercises to boost your mood instantly.</p><h2>How to beat anxiety with 4 simple exercises </h2><p>Anxiety is one of the most common mental health conditions that can be triggered for different reasons. Studies have found that the junk food you always lean on to feel better can be the reason you’re anxious or depressed.</p><p>Some people seize to function in huge social circles, while others are consumed by their own thoughts. Whatever the reason may be, treating it is important to go about your life and not let the world swallow you up.</p><p>Licensed therapist Kati Morton shares four things to do when you’re anxious, to improve your mental health.</p><p>・<strong>MENTAL HEALTH: </strong>Tell-tale sign it’s time to stop seeing your therapist or take a break</p><h2>‘Shake out like a dog’ </h2><p>If you find yourself spiraling or ruminating, the therapist suggests doing a full body shake. She says “shaking out like a dog” gets all the energy out of your nervous system and calms you down immediately.</p><h2>Do the ‘double breath’ </h2><p>Breathing exercises are one of the best ways to treat anxiety and Kati recommends the “double breath” that’s always worked for her.</p><p>She says: “Breathe in all the way to the top. Zip in air again at the very top, and breath out slowly.” Releasing the carbon dioxide form the system helps tackle the anxiety-inducing thoughts.</p><h2>Soak up some sun </h2><p>This is perhaps the easiest way to beat anxiety, given you live in a region with plenty of sunlight. Kati says about 15 minutes of exposure to sun a day does a great deal to you mental health by improving your mood with the release of serotonin.</p><h2>Make meaningful connections </h2><p>Being surrounded by people who see you for who you are and strengthening your bond with your loved ones is one of the ways to overcome anxiety.</p><p>This also means letting go of friends who are toxic, and cutting ties with those who don’t appreciate you enough.</p><p>Kati Morton is a certified therapist and known speaker in the field of mental health. She holds a Master’s in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. Kati has appeared on renowned shows such as Dr. Phil, E! News, CBS The Doctors, and The Dr. Drew Show.</p></main>
