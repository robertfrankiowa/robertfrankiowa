    <main><h1>These Seemingly Innocent Symptoms Could Signal a Serious Health Problem</h1><h2>Bloodshot eyes</h2><p>There are many different explanations for bloodshot eyes. According to Cory Fisher, MD, a family medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic, they’re often related to the superficial eye infection called conjunctivitis, which can go hand-in-hand with other cold symptoms, like a runny nose, sore throat, and cough. </p><p>But if it doesn’t seem to be going away, you might have a bigger problem. “If the red eyes are prolonged—longer than a week or so—or comes with pain or vision changes, it may indicate something more serious, like a deeper infection of the eye or glaucoma,” he says, which is a disease that can cause blindness.</p><figure><img title="Bloodshot eyes" src="IMG/BB1ghojA_bloodshot_eyes.jpg" alt="Bloodshot eyes"><figcaption><em>Bloodshot eyes.

Having foul-smelling discharge could actually be a sign of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection of your reproductive organs that's usually caused by a sexually transmitted disease, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If an STD—like gonorrhea or chlamydia—isn't properly treated, the infection can spread and cause chronic pain, not to mention the possibility of infertility.</p><h2>Skin rash</h2><p>If you’re experiencing a skin rash, you probably just brush it off. While they can certainly mean nothing—like if your skin was just exposed to an allergen or is too dry and needs some lotion, says Dr. Fisher—it can also be an initial stage of a disease. </p><p>“Occasionally, a skin rash can be part of a more significant disease process. Be more concerned if the rash is painful, spreading rapidly, or not responding to initial treatments,” he explains. “Many disease states can present with a rash, including some infections, hematologic diseases, or connective tissue disorders, like lupus.”</p><h2>Dry mouth</h2><p>Going from having a normal amount of saliva in your mouth to the Sahara Desert initially makes you reach for your water bottle. If a lack of fluids isn’t the issue, though, another possibility is Sjogren’s syndrome—an immune disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth. Although it’s possible to develop the syndrome at any age, the Mayo Clinic says it's more common in women over 40.</p><figure><img title="Dry mouth" src="IMG/BB1ghojD_dry_mouth.jpg" alt="Dry mouth"><figcaption><em>Dry mouth.

While it could be a common disorder known as hyperhidrosis—something that affects around three percent of the population—it’s also a symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of cancer that affects your lymphatic system. Typically, those with NHL experience heavy night sweats, as well as weight loss, skin rashes, and swelling of the lymph nodes.</p><figure><img title="Excessive sweating" src="IMG/BB1ghyC2_excessive_sweating.jpg" alt="Excessive sweating"><figcaption><em>Excessive sweating.

If you're having cravings for it constantly, though, it could be a sign of pica, a disorder where you have an appetite for items people wouldn't normally consider food—aka items with no nutritional value. According to the Mayo Clinic, the problem typically goes hand-in-hand with an iron deficiency.</p><h2>Trouble breathing</h2><p>If you feel like you’re getting out of breath way more often than you normally would, you might want to have your doctor check into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). According to the American Lung Association, the disease—which affects your lungs—blocks your airflow, making things you could once do effortlessly now cause shortness of breath.</p><h2>Chest pain</h2><p>When you’re experiencing chest pain, your mind instantly goes to everything from indigestion to a heart attack. Shockingly, in rare cases, it can also be a sign of skin cancer. </p><p>“The X-rays, blood tests, and monitoring was all non-diagnostic, but I couldn't shake the feeling something just wasn’t right and I decided to admit him [a patient] for more in-depth evaluation,” says Nathan Anderson, MD, emergency medicine physician at UCHealth Yampa Valley Medical Center. “After an ultrasound evaluation of the heart, I found multiple tumors embedded in the heart itself that proved to be melanoma—the most serious form of skin cancer that has the vicious ability to metastasize to virtually any tissue in the body.”</p><h2>Black line on your nail</h2><p>How often do you examine your fingernails? If you rarely see them without polish, give them a breather. Especially because if you spot a black streak underneath one of them, it could be a sign of skin cancer. Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM)—a type of melanoma that occurs either on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails, says the AIM at Melanoma Foundation—can occur in all skin types, but it's most commonly seen in Asians and African Americans.</p><figure><img title="Black line on your nail" src="IMG/BB1ghDRm_black_line_on_your_nail.jpg" alt="Black line on your nail"><figcaption><em>Black line on your nail.

Along with the nail issues, you could also experience trembling of the hands, hair loss, muscle weakness, and a fast or irregular heartbeat.</p><h2>Swollen fingers or feet</h2><p>If you’ve noticed some swelling in your fingers lately, it could just be due to having too much salt in your system or not getting enough physical activity, says Dr. Fisher. Or, it might be something serious to get checked out. “Swelling of the extremities can also be a reflection of more a more significant internal process, like kidney disease or congestive heart failure,” he says. “If your swelling is new or worsening, you should definitely contact your doctor.”</p><h2>Pale stool</h2><p>Even though your bowel movements aren't typically a topic of daily discussion, you generally know what they should look like: brown, smooth, and snake-shaped. If your stool is pale and foul-smelling, it could be a sign of celiac disease due to your body not absorbing nutrients properly, says the University of Chicago Medicine.</p><h2>Impaired sense of smell</h2><p>When you’re no longer able to smell things like hot chocolate chip cookies right out of the oven, you know something’s up. Unfortunately, loss of smell is an early—and an incredibly common—sign of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In fact, studies show that olfactory dysfunction is associated with dementia.</p><h2>Abdominal bloating</h2><p>By itself, bloating isn’t normally a big worry: “It’s very common and it can happen around a menstrual cycle or even if you have too much spicy food,” Dr. Fisher says. But if it's not going away, it could be a sign of something more serious, like liver disease or ovarian cancer. “If the bloating is accompanied by abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, or any blood in the stool, this could be a reason for concern,” he says.</p><h2>Leg bruises</h2><p>Everyone gets a bruise here and there, but if you’re starting to notice them popping up more regularly, it could be due to an iron deficiency or something more serious: acute myeloid leukemia (AML). According to the American Cancer Society, they typically show up as small red or purple spots on the skin and are the result of low blood platelet counts.</p><h2>Cloudy urine</h2><p>Your pee can tell you a lot about your health. If it’s been looking cloudy lately instead of its healthy clear or light yellow shade, Dr. Fisher says that could simply be due to not drinking enough water. </p><p>“That said, if you increase your fluid intake and it’s still cloudy or if you have any other symptoms like blood in the urine, pain with urination, or abdominal discomfort, you should call your doctor,” he explains. Cloudy pee could also be a sign of a urinary tract infection, kidney stones, a sexually transmitted infection, or diabetes.</p><h2>Canker sore</h2><p>Anyone who gets canker sores on a regular basis knows how annoying—and downright painful—they can be. Something as simple as spicy food or stress could be the culprit, but it could also be a sign of celiac disease, too, says the Mayo Clinic. Since those with celiac have an intolerance to gluten, the thought is that gluten could be a trigger of the sores.</p><h2>Fruity breath</h2><p>Even though having fruity breath doesn’t necessarily seem like a bad thing—especially compared to other symptoms—it could be related to diabetes. When hyperglycemia—or high blood glucose—isn't treated, you could experience ketoacidosis, which occurs when your body doesn't have enough insulin, says the American Diabetes Association. The fruity taste comes from a buildup of ketones in your bloodstream, and since it can be life-threatening, get to a doctor as soon as you notice it.</p><h2>Urgent bowel movements</h2><p>When you've gotta go, you've gotta go. But if your bowel movements have become urgent and often—causing you to have diarrhea multiple times a day—it could be a sign of ulcerative colitis. The disease causes the large intestine to become inflamed and develop ulcers. Because of that discomfort, it needs to be emptied more frequently, says the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.</p><h2>Cramped handwriting</h2><p>Your handwriting might get a little sloppier over the years thanks to your computer. But if there’s a noticeable change in your style, though—particularly if your wording has gotten a lot smaller—it could be a sign of Parkinson’s disease. With the disease, you experience slower movements and muscle stiffness, resulting in a more cramped handwriting style.</p></main>
