    <main><h1>Millennials Ditch Smartphones for Mental Health</h1><p><b>There’s a growing trend among the younger generation that harkens back to the late 90s and early 2000s – the rise of the “dumb phone.” Here’s the full story.</b></p><h2>Retro Revival</h2><p>Dumb phones – simple retro-style phones that lack the ability to get on social media – are making a comeback as the younger generations look for ways to cut their screen time and take back some control over their digital habits.</p><h2>Digital Detox</h2><p>Both Gen Z and millennials have begun ditching their smartphones for these old-school offerings – typically flip phones with the ability to call and text people without the bells and whistles of next-gen technology. While smartphones have endless apps and constant access to social media, dumb phones keep things simple and focused.</p><h2>Growing Popularity of Basic Phones</h2><p>Sales of these basic phones have been increasing, especially in the U.S. Nokia, for example, has seen a 5% increase in these flip phones’ popularity. It seems like many people – especially younger ones – are tired of being always connected and want a break from the digital noise.</p><h2>Modern Upgrades</h2><p>Don’t let the name fool you – today’s dumb phones have evolved with the times. There’s a whole range of modern dumbphones that offer upgrades like 4G network support, better cameras, and stylish designs. </p><h2>A Focus on Basic Needs</h2><p>However, their core function is a basic phone with basic features.</p><h2>Limited Distractions</h2><p>Some dumb phones do let you install social media apps and other services on them, but they’ve been designed to make that process a tricky undertaking so as not to diminish the phones’ dumb functionality.</p><h2>The Appeal of No Social Media</h2><p>That’s one of the key differences between dumbphones and smartphones – a smartphone is like a Swiss army knife, while a dumbphone is like a dependable old-school pocket knife. It may not have all the fancy gadgets and tools, but it’s reliable, straightforward, and gets the job done.</p><h2>Balancing Act</h2><p>Nokia offers dumb phones with different operating systems like KaiOS. These phones strike a balance by providing essential features while limiting distractions. They even have a light version of WhatsApp for those who need it – it’s enough to stay connected without getting sucked into the endless scrolling of social media.</p><figure><img title="Balancing Act" src="IMG/AA1nVnAM_balancing_act.jpg" alt="Balancing Act"><figcaption><em>Balancing Act.

So, you can still be connected but actually enjoy life without constantly staring at a screen.</p><h2>Impact on Mental Health</h2><p>A lot of the younger generation is jumping on the dumb phone bandwagon as they begin to learn how excessive screen time is affecting their mental health. </p><h2>Escaping Social Media’s Grasp</h2><p>As Lars Silberbauer, chief marketing officer of Nokia Phones and HMD Global, put it, “We can see from the research that young people are struggling with mental health, and so they’re opting out of social media.”</p><h2>Screen Time and Mental Health</h2><p>Studies have linked excessive social media use to issues like ADHD, depression, anxiety, and trouble sleeping.</p><h2>Millennials’ Yearning for Simpler Times</h2><p>Millennials, who are getting older now, are reminiscing about the simpler times of the early 2000s or the ’90s when phones were just for calls and texts.</p><h2>Gen Z’s Fascination with Retro Tech</h2><p>Younger people from Generation Z are curious about a past they didn’t get to experience firsthand. This interest in simpler tech and a less digital-focused life is driving the popularity of dumbphones.</p><h2>Less Digital, More Real Connections</h2><p>Despite the rise of dumb phones, smartphones aren’t going anywhere. They serve a different purpose and cater to a different crowd. </p><h2>Nokia’s Repairable Models</h2><p>Nokia, for example, still sells smartphones and has introduced repairable models to promote sustainability. Repairable phones are part of Nokia’s effort to reduce electronic waste and carbon emissions. </p><h2>Smartphone Sustainability</h2><p>By allowing users to repair their devices easily, Nokia wants to extend phones’ lifespans and discourage the constant need for new purchases every year.</p><figure><img title="Smartphone Sustainability" src="IMG/AA1nVeCP_smartphone_sustainability.jpg" alt="Smartphone Sustainability"><figcaption><em>Smartphone Sustainability.

Both have their place in today’s tech landscape, but if you’re wanting to take a step back from doom scrolling and social media, a dumb phone is probably for you.</p><figure><img title="Deciding Between Smartphones and Dumb Phones" src="IMG/BB1jun0Q_deciding_between_smartphones_and_dumb_phones.jpg" alt="Deciding Between Smartphones and Dumb Phones"><figcaption><em>Deciding Between Smartphones and Dumb Phones.
