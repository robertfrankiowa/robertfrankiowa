    <main><h1>What Causes Acne on the Jawline?</h1><p><strong>Medically reviewed by Casey Gallagher, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Casey Gallagher, MD</strong><p>Adult acne can affect any area of the face but commonly develops along the jawline and chin.</p><p>Jawline and chin acne are also associated with hormonal acne, such as that which occurs during menstruation. It tends to manifest as painful cysts along the chin and jawline rather than in the oily areas of the face like the forehead, cheeks, and nose. Hormonal acne often does not respond well to traditional acne medications and may require medications that target the effect of hormones on the skin.</p><p>This article will discuss what causes acne on the jawline, conditions that cause jaw acne, how jawline acne is treated, home remedies for jawline acne, prevention and outlook of jawline acne, and when to call a healthcare provider.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1oO0Ie_acne_on_jawline.jpg" alt="acne on jawline"><figcaption><em>Anastasia Korchagina / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>What Causes Acne to Form on Your Jawline?</h2><p>Acne is a result of hair follicles under the skin becoming clogged with sebum (oil) and dead skin cells, allowing bacteria to grow and cause inflammation.</p><p>Some factors associated with the development of acne are:</p><ul><li><strong>Hormones</strong>: Hormones can cause acne during puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy.</li><li><strong>Genetics</strong>: Acne appears to run in families.</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: Acne is more common in teens but can occur at other ages, including in the time leading up to menopause (when periods have stopped for 12 straight months).</li><li><strong>Medications</strong>: Certain medications can cause acne to develop.</li></ul><p>Medications associated with the onset of acne include:</p><ul><li>Benzodiazepines</li><li>Lithium</li><li>Cyclosporine</li><li>Ramipril</li><li>Isoniazid</li><li>Iodides</li><li>Bromides</li><li>Vitamin B complexes</li><li>Serotonin uptake inhibitors</li><li>Epidermal growth receptor inhibitors</li><li>Progestin-containing contraceptives</li></ul><p>Factors that may make acne worse include:</p><ul><li>Stress</li><li>Dairy and high-glycemic index foods</li><li>Certain hair or skin products</li><li>Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation</li><li>Smoking</li><li>Sleep disorders</li><li>Excessive skin washing or hard scrubbing</li><li>Environmental irritants (like humidity and pollution)</li><li>Picking at or squeezing blemishes</li></ul><p>Jawline acne may result from a type of acne called acne mechanica. This forms when sports equipment or clothing traps heat and sweat on the skin, causing irritation when the equipment or clothing rubs the heated skin. This can cause acne breakouts in people who are prone to acne.</p><p>Sports that require helmets, such as football or hockey, can lead to chin and jawline acne from the chinstrap.</p><p>Acne mechanica often starts as small, rough-feeling bumps, which then can turn into pimples or deep acne cysts.</p><p><p>This article uses the terms "woman" and "female" to address the hormones typically associated with cisgender females as this is the terminology used in the research. People who experience "female acne" or other conditions that use this terminology may have different genders than female.</p><h2>What Other Conditions Cause Jaw Acne?</h2><p>Endocrine conditions can cause hormonal changes associated with acne. These include:</p><ul><li>Polycysticovary syndrome (PCOS)</li><li>Late congenital adrenal hyperplasiaor dysfunction (genetic disorder caused by mutations in the genes that produce enzymes for hormone creation)</li><li>Although rare, tumors in the ovaries, adrenal glands, pituitary glands, or hypothalamus(area within the brain) </li></ul><p>Jawline acne is associated with adult, female acne. Acne that starts suddenly in adult women can be a sign of a hormone imbalance. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as excessive body hair and/or irregular or light menstrual periods. PCOS is the most common cause of this hormonal imbalance in adult women.</p><h2>How Is Jawline Acne Treated?</h2><p>Treatments to address acne in general include:</p><p><strong>Topical Medications</strong></p><p>Lotions, creams, gels, pads, and other products for acne may contain:</p><ul><li>Benzoyl peroxide</li><li>Antibiotics</li><li>Salicylicacid</li><li>Retinoids</li><li>Sulfur</li><li>Azelaicacid</li><li>Dapsone</li></ul><p><strong>Oral Medications</strong></p><p>A healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications, such as:</p><ul><li>Antibiotics</li><li>Isotretinoin(an oral retinoid)</li><li>Hormone therapy</li><li>Corticosteroids</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Treatments</strong></p><p>If the acne is severe or scarring, and does not respond to traditional treatments, a healthcare provider may suggest additional treatments, such as:</p><ul><li>Injecting corticosteroids directly into the affected areas</li><li>Superficial chemical peels</li><li>Laser or other light therapies (still being studied)</li><li>Using skin fillers to fill acne scars</li><li>Using tiny needles to induce healing on acne scars</li><li>Surgical procedures to help repair and treat acne scarring</li><li>Draining of cysts and abscesses</li><li>Microdermabrasion</li></ul><p>Some of these medications and treatments carry side effects, and may not be appropriate for certain people, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Check with your healthcare provider before beginning any acne treatment.</p><p>Acne on the jawline, lower face, and neck can be associated with hormonal acne, particularly adult female acne. This acne often doesn't respond well to the treatments used for typical "teenage" acne.</p><p>Hormonal therapy can be helpful in treating this type of acne. These may include medicatons such as:</p><ul><li>Oral contraceptives (the pill)</li><li>Spironolactone(used to treat high blood pressure and excess fluid, but can also be used to treat deep-seated, tender acne on the jawline, lower face, or neck)</li></ul><p>These medications can be more effective when taken together, but they can also be taken individually.</p><p>Both of these medications can carry side effects and may not be safe or appropriate for all individuals.</p><p>Spironolactone can cause serious birth defects if taken during pregnancy. It is essential to take steps to prevent pregnancy while on this medication.</p><p>Talk to your healthcare provider about all of the benefits and risks before starting hormonal therapy.</p><h2>Home Remedies for Jawline Acne</h2><p>In addition to medical treatment for acne, it is important to take care of acne-prone skin. Take measures such as:</p><ul><li>Gently cleaning your skin using lukewarm water and a mild cleanser (avoid strong soaps, rough scrub pads, or astringents) in the morning, evening, and after heavy exercise.</li><li>Use sunscreen, especially if you are using acne medications that make you more prone to sunburn.</li><li>If shaving, use a sharp blade, soften the hair with soap and water before applying shaving cream, and go gently (be careful not to nick blemishes).</li><li>Don't touch, rub, squeeze, or pick blemishes.</li><li>Choose skin and hair products that are oil free and labeled noncomedogenic (doesn't clog pores).</li></ul><h2>How to Prevent Jawline Acne</h2><p>Acne can't always be prevented, but like caring for skin with acne blemishes, caring for acne-prone skin may help prevent or minimize acne breakouts.</p><p>The American Academy of Dermatology Association recommends tips such as:</p><ul><li>Keep your skin clean, using gentle, nonabrasive cleanser applied with your fingertips instead of with tools like washcloths or sponges.</li><li>Use alcohol-free skin care products, and avoid products such as toners, exfoliants, and astringents.</li><li>Shampoo your hair regularly to avoid oil transfer from your hair to your skin.</li><li>Stick with your treatment plan and give it time to work.</li><li>Avoid touching your face.</li><li>Avoid the sun and tanning beds.</li><li>When outdoors, use sun protection such as sun-protective clothing and broad-spectrum, noncomedogenic sunscreen that is water resistant and has a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.</li></ul><p>To help treat and prevent acne caused by sports equipment:</p><ul><li>Use clean, soft padding between the equipment (such as a helmet chin strap) and your skin.</li><li>Wear moisture-wicking clothing.</li><li>Wear loose-fitting clothing (do not loosen your helmet beyond recommendations as this could lessen its effectiveness).</li><li>Use acne medication for acne mechanica, such as salicylic acid.</li></ul><h2>Whatâ€™s the Outlook for Someone With Jawline Acne?</h2><p>Hormonal therapy tends to provide good results for women with jawline and lower face acne. The contraceptive pill typically shows improvements within two to three months. Spironolactone tends to show a decrease in breakouts and oiliness within a few weeks. Hormonal therapy can also help prevent future acne breakouts.</p><p>Acne may cause complications such as:</p><ul><li>Pits or raised scars</li><li>Red or dark spots after healing that can take weeks to months to resolve, particularly on darker skin</li><li>Emotional toll and elevated risk of depression</li></ul><p>Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help prevent and address complications from acne.</p><h2>When to Contact a Healthcare Provider</h2><p>Talk to your healthcare provider if you have experiences such as:</p><ul><li>Acne you have not treated before, to determine which treatments are appropriate for you</li><li>Moderate or severe acne</li><li>Nodules or cysts</li><li>Acne that is not responding to treatment</li><li>Feelings of anxiety or stress</li><li>Signs of depression</li><li>Acne that is affecting your daily life or self-esteem (such as worrying about how you look, avoiding social situations, feeling down, or feeling upset)</li><li>Other symptoms, such as excess hair growth or changes in menstruation that may indicate a hormonal imbalance or another health condition</li><li>Acne breakouts that may be related to medications you are taking</li><li>You have any questions or concerns</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>Jawline acne is associated with hormonal acne and adult acne, particularly female adult acne.</p><p>Jawline acne is also associated with irritation from sports equipment such as helmets.</p><p>Acne may be treated with topical medications, oral medications, and in some cases medical procedures such as chemical peels.
