    <main><h1>How to make your smoothies healthier, according to nutritionists</h1><p>Fruit- and vegetable-packed smoothies have been a tasty and convenient way to consume healthy foods and nutrients for years — and their popularity shows no signs of waning. While you can grab a pre-made smoothie at coffee shops and the grocery store, they’re generally going to be healthier — and more to your liking — if you make them at home. That’s because you can control the variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and other ingredients, along with the flavor and texture.</p><p>But is your smoothie actually adding vitamins and nutrients to your diet, or do you need to up your smoothie game by working in more fiber and protein? And can some ingredients cancel out the health benefits of others?</p><p>To find out how to make the most of these blended beverages, Yahoo Life asked registered dietitian Alyssa Pacheco and nutritional practitioner Kyla Channell about what we should be scooping into our smoothies.</p><h2><strong>Which ingredients make a smoothie healthier?</strong></h2><p>It’s all about balance when building a healthy smoothie, Pacheco says. “I always recommend having a source of fiber, protein and fat in a smoothie,” she tells Yahoo Life. “This combo of macronutrients helps to keep blood sugar levels more stable, keeping you feeling full for longer and with more sustained energy levels.”</p><p>In other words, make sure your smoothie is more than just fruit and fruit juice. “I think many are missing the mark when it comes to getting in all three macronutrients,” Channell says. “I tend to see clients load up on just fruit and fruit juice” without including healthy fats, proteins and vegetables.“This all-fruit smoothie will likely leave the client with a blood sugar spike, then crash and get hungry again soon, and they think that they ate something really healthy. And they're not wrong — they just didn’t balance it in a way to help sustain their energy and hunger for longer.”</p><p>That’s not to say you should leave out fruit. “Fruits and veggies are great additions to any smoothie because they'll provide you with a good amount of fiber, vitamins and minerals,” Pacheco says. “I love adding frozen berries to my smoothies because they’re one of the higher fiber fruit options and when you use frozen fruit, it's generally most cost effective and replaces the need to use ice.”</p><p>Channell likes using a mix of fruit and vegetables in smoothies. “Things like blueberries, raspberries, bananas, apple sauce, açai powder, spinach, kale, chard, collard greens, frozen cauliflower, shredded carrots, cucumber and cooked beets are all amazing options,” she says.</p><p>For protein, Channell suggests adding Greek yogurt or cottage cheese, which give a creamier consistency to the smoothie, or protein powder or kefir. You’ll also want to add “healthy fats like nut butter, chia seeds, flax seeds or full fat yogurt or dairy,” she says.</p><h2><strong>What are some surprising ingredients to add to smoothies?</strong></h2><p>Adding certain foods to your smoothies can make them more nutritious and filling. Channell’s secret weapon to getting more fiber and protein: beans.</p><p>“I love getting clients to include more fiber as that can help with satiety and cholesterol,” Channell explains. “Some great ways to do that are by adding in 1/3 cup canned cannellini beans or great northern beans,” she says, swearing you don’t taste them.</p><p>Pacheco is a fan of adding chia seeds because “they're packed with fiber, having 10g of fiber in just two tablespoons.” Chia seeds are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which she says are beneficial for reducing inflammation and improving heart health. “If you're not a fan of chia seeds, this is a great way to get the health benefits of them since you can't even tell they're in your smoothie once it's blended up,” she says.</p><p>Another smart addition? Frozen cauliflower rice. Pacheco says it’s another “sneaky way” to add more nutrition to your smoothie. “Frozen cauliflower rice has a very mild flavor that is easily covered up by the sweet taste of fruit in your smoothie,” she says. “Cauliflower is a great source of antioxidants like vitamin C and quercetin, which can help to reduce inflammation.”</p><h2><strong>Why it’s important to add protein</strong></h2><p>Protein, which helps provide building blocks for muscle, our immune system and bones, is a must in smoothies. “A lot of people don’t realize how important protein is for our immune and bone health,” Channell says. “In addition, it helps with satiety, meaning you will feel full for longer and that typically means snacking less.”</p><p>She notes that complete proteins — which include all nine amino acids that our bodies can’t make on their own — are best. “If you can include a complete protein such as a dairy source, this will help to provide higher levels of leucine, the amino acid that helps to stimulate muscle protein synthesis,” she says.</p><p>Try adding Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, kefir, milk or whey protein powder to your smoothie, and for a plant-based option, try pea protein powder or frozen peas.</p><h2><strong>Can some ingredients cancel out the health benefits of others?</strong></h2><p>Surprisingly, yes. Researchers recently discovered that adding a banana to a berry smoothie decreased the health-promoting flavanol levels of the berries. Flavanols are a subtype of a group of natural compounds called flavonoids found in red wine and fruits such as berries, apples and pears. Studies have shown that people who consume the most flavonoids tend to have lower blood pressure, and they can protect against heart attack, stroke and Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>However, Pacheco notes this recent study only included 19 men, explaining, “This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t add a banana to your berry smoothie if you enjoy it. There are several other nutritious components of the berries that you will be obtaining, such as fiber, potassium and vitamin C. Most people can benefit from including more fruits into their diet.”</p><p>Pacheco does point out that there are “many instances in human nutrition where nutrients can compete and you don't obtain the full benefits of all nutrients you’re consuming.” One common example is iron and calcium. “If you're having a meal that is high in both iron and calcium, these two minerals compete for absorption,” she explains. “Your body will typically absorb less iron because of the presence of calcium.”</p><p>But that’s not a reason to avoid these foods, she says. For example, tofu is a food that is a good source of both iron and calcium. “Just because your body won't be able to adequately absorb all of that iron doesn't mean that it's a reason to avoid tofu since it's a great source of plant-based protein, zinc, magnesium and other nutrients,” she says.</p></main>
