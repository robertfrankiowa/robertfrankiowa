    <main><h1>9 Foods That Could Make Eczema Worse (and many that can help)</h1><h2>Causes of Eczema and Atopic Dermatitis</h2><p>Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a medical condition that causes skin to be red and itchy. It's actually a chronic health condition, according to some sources, and tends to "<em>flare</em>" on occasion. Officially, no single cure has been found . There are other types of eczema, including dyshidrotic eczema, which causes itchy blisters on the fingers, toes, and palms of hands and soles of feet .</p><p>Contact dermatitis-an itchy rash caused by an allergic reaction to or direct contact with a substance-and seborrheic dermatitis, which causes dandruff, are other types of eczema that people experience . Experts claim the specific cause of eczema "<em>remains unknown</em>", presumably because it's likely different for everyone. Everything from soap and detergent to mold, food, stress, and hormones can play a role in causing eczema .</p><h2>How to Treat Eczema</h2><p>Conventional treatment for eczema focuses on a combination of prevention techniques and medical therapies, including "<em>bleach baths</em>" (yes, it's what you're thinking), immunosuppressant drugs, corticosteroids, and keeping your skin moisturized . I don't know about you, but it doesn't sound to me like any of these things would be super helpful for eczema and also beneficial for your body at the same time (not counting moisturizing).</p><p>Holistic and integrative health care approaches to treating eczema include adjusting your diet to remove the most common allergens that could be causing your eczema, one technique of which is the elimination diet . While this diet isn't for everyone, it can be useful for those who don't know the cause of their eczema. I always advocate for getting tested first before attempting to eliminate different foods, as this can be hugely helpful in identifying causes and triggers for eczema, such as in my experience .</p><p>It's unrealistic to assume food would be the cause of everyone's eczema, so it's important to consider other triggers such as stress and environmental factors. However, let's not forget that both of these factors can lead to a leaky gut, which can cause food allergies and intolerances .</p><h2>9 Foods to Avoid That Could Make Eczema Worse</h2><p>So now that we have a better idea of what eczema is, its conventional treatments, and potential holistic approaches to dealing with the problem, here are nine different foods to consider when evaluating the cause or triggers of your eczema.</p><h2>Eggs</h2><p>Eggs can show up anywhere, especially in processed foods, and many people react to them. In fact, experts say that 2 percent of children have an egg allergy .</p><figure><img title="Eggs" src="IMG/BB1pChZO_eggs.jpg" alt="Eggs"><figcaption><em>Eggs.

An allergy to cow's milk is the most common allergy in young children and infants .</p><h2>Soy</h2><p>Soy is the number one genetically modified crop in the world and is present in a huge amount of processed foods . If you enjoy soy, consider choosing a non-GMO version!</p><h2>Gluten</h2><p>Gluten is a protein that's present in wheat, barley, and rye, so while all wheat contains gluten, not all gluten comes from wheat. Gluten intolerance has been linked to many health disorders and conditions, including skin diseases such as dermatitis .</p><h2>Fish</h2><p>Some people react to certain types of fish, although this type of allergy isn't as common as milk or eggs. Symptoms could include hives, nausea or indigestion, asthma, and headaches .</p><figure><img title="Fish" src="IMG/BB1pCorY_fish.jpg" alt="Fish"><figcaption><em>Fish.

People could react to cashews, walnuts, almonds, sesame seeds, or even coconut .</p><figure><img title="Nuts" src="IMG/BB1pCi0N_nuts.jpg" alt="Nuts"><figcaption><em>Nuts.  Source: Shutterstock </em></figcaption></figure><h2>High Sugar Foods</h2><p>Refined sugar can have an inflammatory effect on the body, especially if consumed frequently or in high doses, and lead to different effects on the gut that could even trigger a leaky gut .</p><h2>Foods High in Nickel</h2><p>Foods high in nickel could trigger dyshidrotic eczema and include foods such as beans, black tea, chocolate, nuts, peas, seeds, shellfish, and soybeans (which, ironically, are a lot of foods on this list!) .</p><h2>Foods You Can Enjoy That May Help Eczema</h2><p>There are certain foods that have the potential to help your eczema, including foods high in quercetin, which is a flavonoid (a type of phytonutrient) that may help reduce inflammation. Foods include fruits such as apples, blueberries, and cherries and vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, and kale .</p><p>If you don't have a fish allergy or intolerance, fish are a powerful source of omega-3s. While natural foods are the best way to get essential omega-3s, supplementation is also an option. Vegan supplements are available that can provide helpful EPA/DHA omega-3s, such as from algae oil .</p><p>Foods high in probiotics-given they're not made from milk, especially if you are intolerant-can benefit your body. Plant-based sources include miso (which is soy, so be careful), kimchi, kombucha, sauerkraut, and water kefir. Supplementation is also a viable route, but make sure they are either free of dairy or any potential allergens you may be trying to avoid. </p><figure><img title="Foods You Can Enjoy That May Help Eczema" src="IMG/BB1pCosI_foods_you_can_enjoy_that_may_help_eczema.jpg" alt="Foods You Can Enjoy That May Help Eczema"><figcaption><em>Foods You Can Enjoy That May Help Eczema.  Source: Shutterstock </em></figcaption></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Foods may be able to help your eczema, or you can work with your natural healthcare provider to get tested for food intolerances or potentially try an elimination diet. For those who have dyshidrotic eczema, avoiding contact with nickel (yes, this includes jewelry) may help. A diet focused on nutrient-rich foods can help, but remember that food isn't the only culprit, and everyone is different!</p></main>
