    <main><h1>The Best Morning Stretches For Men Will Make You Limber</h1><p><p>Sit a lot? Even if you have perfect posture, spending a lot of time sedentary is bad for your body on multiple levels. For starters, sitting eight hours a day has been shown to raise your risk of stroke, heart disease, and hypertension, to name a few. Moreover, studies show that long periods of sitting can lead to lower back pain, while other research indicates it can strain the muscles in your neck and shoulder. But if you’ve got a desk job, sitting is kind of par for the course. What you need (in addition to regular exercise) is a morning stretch routine with the best morning stretches for men that will work out the kinks and set you up for feeling good the whole day through.</p><p>Doing morning stretches is a simple investment with big return. “You don’t need a huge amount of time — there are some easy stretches you can do in 10 minutes that will make a difference in how you feel for the rest of the day,” says Jayson Lee, a personal trainer in New York City.</p><p>What might those be? Take a look at the best morning stretches for men, listed below, and promise yourself you’ll do these stretches at least four times a week — and preferably, daily. How long you hold each stretch depends in part on how your body feels. (“As a general rule, count slowly to 10, then release,” says Lee.) But don’t bounce, and don’t force the stretch: Your muscles and ligaments are tight and stiff after a night of sleeping, and you could risk injury.</p><h2><b>Upward Facing Dog</b></h2><p><b>What it stretches: </b>Pectoral muscles; deltoids</p><p><b>How to:</b> Lie on your stomach, bend your elbows, and place your hands beneath your shoulders, palms flat against the floor.
