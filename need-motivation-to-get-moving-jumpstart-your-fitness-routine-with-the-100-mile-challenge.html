    <main><h1>Need motivation to get moving? Jumpstart your fitness routine with the 100-mile challenge</h1><p>Did you set a resolution to make your health a priority in 2024? We took the first week of the new year as a buffer week — easing back into some healthy habits and getting our head in the game after the holiday season. </p><p>Now it’s time to hit the ground running — or walking.</p><p>When it comes to starting a fitness routine, walking is one of the easiest places to start and it delivers some major mental and physical health benefits. That’s why we’re starting the new year strong by hitting the pavement. Your goal? Walk 100 miles in 31 days.</p><h2>100-Mile Challenge</h2><p><strong><em>>>Download a printable calendar</em></strong></p><p>Logging 100 miles in one month may sound ambitious — and it is! — but if you break down the numbers you’ll see it is a totally doable goal.</p><p>One mile is about 2,000 steps. So, if you’re spreading your mileage out evenly over the 31-day period, that comes out to about 6,500 steps a day, which is well below the 8,000-10,000 steps goal many health experts encourage. </p><p>Plus, we’re tracking all movement throughout the day. That means it’s not only the walks you take for exercise, but the steps you take commuting to work, doing chores around the house and running errands. If there are days you fall short, that’s OK! Take a longer walk over the weekend or plan something active that will help you get in more steps, like hiking with your family, walking the farmer’s market or grabbing coffee with a friend and walking through the park.</p><h2><strong>The health benefits of walking</strong></h2><p>Why are we focused on walking? From improving your heart health and circulation to aiding in weight loss and boosting your mood, walking may just be the easiest way to improve our health.</p><p>According to research, moderate-intensity walking and vigorous-intensity running yielded similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease. Another study showed that people who stuck with a walking program had significant improvements in blood pressure, slowing of resting heart rate, reduction of body fat and body weight, reduced cholesterol and improved depression scores.</p><p>It’s also especially smart to include walking in your routine this time of year, when dark days can have us feeling down. Studies show walking releases endorphins that can boost your mood improves, and that walking decreases symptoms of stress, like anxiety, sadness, fatigue, and lack of motivation.</p><h2>Indoor walking workouts</h2><p>Walking outdoors can be dicey this time of year. For days when the weather doesn't cooperate, I've put together these fun indoor walking workouts that will help you rack up steps without even leaving the house.</p><h2>1-Mile Indoor Walking Workout</h2><ul><li><strong>Time:</strong> 20 minutes </li><li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1 mile</li><li><strong>Step count: </strong>2000 steps</li></ul><h2>10-Minute HIIT Walking Workout</h2><ul><li><strong>Time:</strong> 10 minutes </li><li><strong>Distance: </strong>1 mile</li><li><strong>Step count:</strong> 1500 steps</li></ul><h2><strong>5 exercises to rack up more steps indoors</strong></h2><p>On the days you don't have time to walk or fall short of your daily step goal, these five exercises will help you rack up some extra steps throughout the day or at night before you go to bed.</p><figure><img title="" src="IMG/AA1mw9Bs_jumping_jacks.jpg" alt="jumping jacks"><figcaption><em>jumping jacks. </em></figcaption></figure><h3>Jumping jacks</h3><p>Start standing with feet hips-distance apart.
