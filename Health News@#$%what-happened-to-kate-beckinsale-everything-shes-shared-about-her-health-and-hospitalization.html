    <main><h1>What Happened To Kate Beckinsale? Everything She's Shared About Her Health And Hospitalization</h1><p>Kate Beckinsale has shared the reasons behind her hospitalization earlier this year.</p><p>On July 8, the actress, 50, took to her Instagram comments section to open up about her health. After posting a video clapping back at critics who say she doesn't act "age-appropriate," one commenter wrote that she was too thin and should "go do some squats," per <em>People</em>.</p><p>"No, actually," Kate replied. "I watched my stepfather [Roy Battersby] die quite shockingly, my mother has stage 4 cancer, and I lost a lot of weight from stress and grief, quite quickly."</p><p>"I was in the hospital for six weeks because the grief had burned a hole in my [esophagus] which made me vomit copious amounts of blood," she continued. "I found eating very hard and I just worked very very hard on a movie that was actually quite triggering because it also involved the theme of the death of my father. So I’m not really concerned about what you think about my a**."</p><p>Kate's stepfather, director Roy Battersby died in January after a "brief illness," per <em>People</em>. The actress opened up about her mom's diagnosis in May. </p><p>In March, Kate began posting—and then deleting—a series of photos of herself in a hospital gown. She appeared to return home in early April, per <em>People</em>.</p><p>On May 2, she returned to the red carpet at the inaugural King's Trust Gala in New York City, telling reporters that it's been a “rough year.” per <em>People</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Here’s a timeline of Kate Beckinsale's health journey and hospitalization so far. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>March 10: Kate says she’s ‘sick’ in a since-deleted IG post </strong></h2><p>In early March, Kate shared an Instagram post that’s now been deleted to celebrate U.K. Mother's Day. In two of the pictures, Kate can be seen wearing a large black bow on her head while sitting in a hospital bed with tears in her eyes. </p><p>“Happy birthday and UK Mother’s Day this last week to my incredible mother,” she wrote in the caption. “Thank you to those that love us and support us when it’s s*** and try to make sure there are some bits that aren’t. And for looking after our dogs when we can’t, and lead us to remember happy things when we can’t. And turn up when we are sick and sit with us. And send balloons and check in and pull us out of wells with love.”</p><p>Kate also wrote, “happy everything mama. Your fight for joy despite also welcoming tears is the experience of watching a warrior up close. I love you.”</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>March 12 and March 13: Kate's pets visit her</strong></h2><p>A few days later, Kate shared that she was still in the hospital. She posted a picture in her Instagram Story, per <em>People</em>, of her Pomeranian Myf hanging in a hospital bed with her. Kate wrote “Visitor” over top—and she did the same thing when her cat Willow came to visit the day before. </p><figure><img title="Kate Beckinsale / Instagram" src="IMG/AA1nsVr3_screen_shot_2024_04_22_at_14121_pmpng.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-22 at 1.41.21 PM.png"><figcaption><em>On March 13, Kate Beckinsale shared this Instagram story of her dog Myf visiting her at the hospital..

The two wore peanut-themed headbands as they posed for the camera. </p><figure><img title="Kate Beckinsale / Instagram" src="IMG/AA1nsXPk_screen_shot_2024_04_22_at_14818_pmpng.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-22 at 1.48.18 PM.png"><figcaption><em>Kate Beckinsale and friend Jonathan Voluck pose in a hospital room. . Kate Beckinsale / Instagram</em></figcaption></figure><p> “🥜🥜🌈🌈🖕🏻😢🌈🌈🥜🥜,” she wrote in the caption, per <em>People</em>. Kate also shared a photo of a rainbow in the sky, followed by a jar with the label, “F---s to give.” That post has also been removed. </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>April 17: Kate wears a 'Tummy Troubles Survivor' t-shirt</strong></h2><p>Kate gave the first clue that her health issues are stomach-related in mid-April, when she shared photos of herself posing in a T-shirt that read, “Tummy Troubles Survivor.” (The photos also shoed Myf hilariously wearing mittens that looked like hands on his paws.)</p><p>Kate kept the caption simple, writing, “💪🏼 🤍.”</p><p>She responded to one of her followers who said that her "ruptured cyst must have taken such a toll" on her. Replying in the comments section of the post, she wrote, "I didn’t have a ruptured cyst since 2019. But thank you so much for your kind wishes x." </p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>April 20: Kate further hints at stomach issues</strong></h2><p>Kate shared a post about celebrating her late stepfather Roy’s birthday, noting that she’s been unable to take down her Christmas tree because they decorated it together. In her caption, she also referenced having stomach issues. </p><p>“Do all the things. Wallow, cry, celebrate, look at the wall in disbelief. Send your mum flowers. Swim in your mind with his idols. Google. Talk to your safe person. Avoid those with not quite enough bandwidth for this,” she said. </p><p>She also wrote, “Buy gourmet cookies you can’t eat because your stomach hurts. Maybe eat them anyway. Or don’t,” hinting that she’s still having digestive problems. </p><p>She ended on this note: “Laugh and cry when you receive an email from a dentist you took him to once, wishing your dead father a happy birthday. Do it all. Or do none. There’s no map. I’m with you all.”</p><h2 class="body-h2"><strong>May 2: Kate returns to red carpet for the first time since her health scare</strong></h2><p>Kate made her return to the public eye on May 2, appearing on the King's Trust Gala red carpet. She wore a sculpted, one-shoulder sheer gown with a thigh-high slit. Kate paired the dress with a black bow, white platform heels, and a bejeweled green clutch. </p><p>“It's been a rough year,” Kate shared with <em>People</em>. “Because my parents have both been unwell and my cat...it's been a bunch of things. So that's why it's nice to come and see friends and have a little perspective. Everyone's had a bit of a rough year, I think.” </p><p>Before this, Kate’s last red carpet appearance was in February for the SAG-AFTRA awards. She also appeared at the Golden Globes in January, but finished off the evening visiting her stepfather Roy Battersby in the hospital. Roy, 87, ultimately passed away days later after "a brief period of illness," <em>People </em>reports.</p><h2 class="body-h2">July 8: Kate says she was hospitalized after grief "burned a hole" in her esophagus</h2><p>In July, Kate finally shared why she was treated earlier that year. After posting a video clapping back at critics who say she doesn't act "age-appropriate," one commenter wrote that she was too thin and should "go do some squats," per <em>People</em>.</p><p>"No, actually," Kate replied. "I watched my stepfather [Roy Battersby] die quite shockingly, my mother has stage 4 cancer, and I lost a lot of weight from stress and grief, quite quickly."</p><p>"I was in the hospital for six weeks because the grief had burned a hole in my [esophagus] which made me vomit copious amounts of blood," she continued. "I found eating very hard and I just worked very very hard on a movie that was actually quite triggering because it also involved the theme of the death of my father. So I’m not really concerned about what you think about my a**." </p><p>Glad you're feeling better, Kate!</p></main>
