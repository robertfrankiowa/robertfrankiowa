    <main><h1>10 Common Condiments That Could Impact Cardiovascular Health</h1><p>Condiments are a staple in many kitchens, adding flavor and zest to our meals. However, some condiments may have an impact on cardiovascular health that’s worth noting. In this article, we’ll delve into 10 common condiments that could potentially affect cardiovascular health. By understanding how these condiments may influence our heart health, we can make more informed choices about our dietary habits.</p><h2>Mayonnaise</h2><p>A staple in many households, mayonnaise is often high in saturated fats and calories, which, when consumed excessively, can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of heart diseases. As a healthier alternative, try using avocado or Greek yogurt, which contain healthier fats and nutrients beneficial to your heart health.</p><h2>Creamy Salad Dressings</h2><p>Many creamy salad dressings have trans fats and high amounts of sodium, which can elevate your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A better option could be olive oil-based dressings that are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.</p><h2>Ketchup</h2><p>While it is a popular addition to various dishes, traditional ketchup often contains high levels of sugar and sodium. Using fresh tomatoes or salsa can be a healthier alternative, offering the richness of lycopene without the added sugars and salts.</p><h2>BBQ Sauce</h2><p>Commonly high in sugar and sodium, BBQ sauce can contribute to increased heart disease risk. For a healthier version, try making a homemade sauce using vinegar, tomatoes, and natural spices to control the sugar and sodium levels.</p><figure><img title="BBQ Sauce" src="IMG/AA1nZ2Aj_bbq_sauce.jpg" alt="BBQ Sauce"><figcaption><em>BBQ Sauce.

Using low-sodium soy sauce or tamari can be a smarter choice for those looking to maintain their heart health.</p><figure><img title="Soy Sauce" src="IMG/AA1nZekG_soy_sauce.jpg" alt="Soy Sauce"><figcaption><em>Soy Sauce.

	</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Margarine</h2><p>Historically, margarine contained trans fats that were linked to heart disease. Even though many brands have removed trans fats, margarine still contains high levels of saturated fats. Opt for spreads made from olive oil or avocados for a heart-healthier choice.</p><h2>Relish</h2><p>While it seems innocent, relish can contain added sugars and sodium. Making a homemade version using fresh cucumbers, dill, and vinegar can be a healthier, tastier option.</p><h2>Cheese Whiz</h2><p>This processed cheese product is high in sodium and saturated fats. Consider using real cheese sparingly, or try nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor without the unhealthy fats.</p><h2>Canned Gravy</h2><p>Frequently laden with saturated fats and sodium, canned gravies can contribute to heart health issues over time. Making homemade gravy using low-sodium broths can be a healthier alternative.</p><h2>Artificial Sweeteners</h2><p>Often found in âsugar-freeâ or âdietâ condiments, artificial sweeteners can have a negative impact on your heart’s health. Opt for natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup in moderation to avoid potential risks.</p><figure><img title="Artificial Sweeteners" src="IMG/AA1nZ4PF_artificial_sweeteners.jpg" alt="Artificial Sweeteners"><figcaption><em>Artificial Sweeteners.
