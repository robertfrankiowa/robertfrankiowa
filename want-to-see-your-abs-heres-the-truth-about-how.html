    <main><h1>Want To See Your Abs? Here’s The Truth About How</h1><p>Getting visible abs is often seen as the ultimate fitness goal, but the truth behind achieving it might surprise you. It’s not just about endless crunches and sit-ups; it involves a lot more than just working out. A few years ago, I set a personal goal that seemed natural for a four-year CrossFit enthusiast: I wanted to see my abs. Despite the hours I dedicated to the gym, they had remained elusive. As a woman in my mid-30s who ate healthily and lived an active lifestyle, I was curious what more it would take to finally achieve this. Here are the key adjustments that helped me the most.</p><h2>Count Macros</h2><p>Tracking your macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) gives you control over your diet. It helps ensure you’re eating the right balance of nutrients to fuel your workouts and fat loss. Working with a health coach that helped me calculate my specific macro split for my goals was a crucial part of my success.</p><figure><img title="Count Macros" src="IMG/BB1jDKfB_count_macros.jpg" alt="Count Macros"><figcaption><em>Count Macros.

It’s also a champion at making you feel full longer, helping you eat less throughout the day. This macronutrient is the key to healthy weight loss that will help you achieve your aesthetic goals. I ate the protein on my plate first with every meal and always made sure there was at least 25g in a meal.</p><figure><img title="Prioritize Protein" src="IMG/BB1jSMAI_prioritize_protein.jpg" alt="Prioritize Protein"><figcaption><em>Prioritize Protein.

Loading your plate with veggies means you can eat a larger volume of food and when you’re in a calorie deficit, that’s an important part of the process. It’s much easier to diet when you fill satisfied with every meal.</p><h2>Strength Train 4-5 Times Per Week</h2><p>Strength training builds muscle and increases metabolism, which helps burn fat even when you’re not working out. Consistency here is key to shedding fat. Don’t be afraid to lift heavy. You won’t get bulky in the process. A pound of muscle looks a lot better than a pound of fat on your body!</p><h2>Walk On Days Off From the Gym</h2><p>Walking on rest days keeps your body moving and calories burning without overstressing your muscles. It’s a gentle way to stay active, aiding in recovery and weight loss efforts. I walked for an hour every day I wasn’t in the gym and found this type of movement much better for my body than killing myself with other forms of cardio.</p><figure><img title="Walk On Days Off From the Gym" src="IMG/BB1jSOWT_walk_on_days_off_from_the_gym.jpg" alt="Walk On Days Off From the Gym"><figcaption><em>Walk On Days Off From the Gym.

Getting enough rest also regulates hormones that control hunger, helping you make better food choices and stick to your weight loss goals. Everyone is a little different but most of us need between 7-9 hours to truly feel our best.</p><h2>Focus on Hydration</h2><p>Drinking plenty of water boosts metabolism, helps digest food, and keeps you feeling full. It’s essential for flushing out toxins and supporting overall health. If you’re working out hard, you’ll probably need electrolytes as well. </p><h2>Never Drink Calories</h2><p>Sugary drinks can sabotage weight loss with empty calories. Stick to water, tea, or black coffee to hydrate without derailing your diet. Eating your calories is so much more satisfying than drinking them.</p><h2>Reduce Eating Out</h2><p>When you have weight loss and aesthetic goals, eating out is not your friend. Restaurant meals often contain hidden calories and oversized portions. Cooking at home gives you control over ingredients and portion sizes. While your social life may take a hit, it’s easiest to just avoid this for the time being.</p><h2>Limit Snacks</h2><p>Mindless snacking can add up in calories, hindering your weight loss progress. If you’re hungry between meals, opt for healthy, low-calorie snacks high in protein that support your goals and work with your macros.</p><h2>Never Leave Lunch to Chance</h2><p>Planning your meals, especially lunch, ensures you have healthy options and aren’t tempted by fast food or a lunch run with coworkers. I used weekends to meal prep lunches for the week making sure I always had meals that fit my needs on hand.</p><figure><img title="Never Leave Lunch to Chance" src="IMG/BB1jPfyt_never_leave_lunch_to_chance.jpg" alt="Never Leave Lunch to Chance"><figcaption><em>Never Leave Lunch to Chance.

I started out healthy and in already in good shape but this was a 12 week journey for me to achieve. If you’re starting out in a different spot, it will take longer. In the end, it was fun to achieve my goals and I kept it up for awhile, but after some time, I decided abs weren’t everything and loosened my reign a bit.</p><h2>10 'Healthy' Foods That Are Secretly Skyrocketing Your Blood Sugar</h2><p>Ever think you’re eating healthy but still feel like your blood sugar levels are on a rollercoaster?
