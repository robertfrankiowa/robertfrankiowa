Provided by Flow Space</em></figcaption></figure><p>I began running in 1995 when I was in seventh grade, a year before the film <em>Forrest Gump</em> was released. While watching the film, I remember relating intensely to Tom Hanks' character’s focus and drive. At the time, I was also playing basketball and often pushed myself to the brink, sometimes to the point of blacking out. This ability to hyperfocus on my interests followed me into my running career, allowing me to immerse myself fully in the activity.</p><p>When I joined Lululemon’s FURTHER six-day race in March 2024, this hyperfocus allowed me to push through extreme levels of pain, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. It also led me to break 12 World Records and 13 records in total (including surpassing a men's American Record by improving the women’s 48-hour World Record by 14.8 miles and ranking third best ever in the world). But it was also the catalyst that motivated me to pursue an official autism and ADHD diagnosis at the age of 42.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life before my diagnosis </h2><p>Although I knew little about autism before seeking out a diagnosis, my husband, who observed my daily quirks and often reminded me to eat, drink, and go to bed, would jokingly speculate that I might be autistic. However, it wasn't until April, during a trip to Oklahoma, that I seriously considered the possibility. A conversation with a friend, whose adult daughter had just been diagnosed with autism, prompted me to take online tests.</p><p>My friend suggested I check for autism traits, especially after I had made a social media post that garnered similar feedback. Test after test confirmed significant traits for autism, and I found the process straightforward, recognizing myself in each question. Motivated by my friend’s advice and our shared experiences, I began searching for a specialist.</p><p>It was also around this time that my husband and I had just relocated to Arizona and were in the process of getting our insurance changed. I soon realized that finding a provider who understood autism in adult females would be challenging. I started trying to figure out if I could go through my insurance and find a health provider that was local. Not only did I realize it would be difficult to find a specialist that understands autism, but to find one that understands autism in women. I was like, I don’t even know where to start with this. (For example, according to data from UCLA Health, many women with autism spectrum disorder go undiagnosed until adulthood. In fact, almost 80% of autistic females remain undiagnosed by the age of 18. Historically, boys have been diagnosed with autism at a rate four times higher than girls, and women are known to camouflage or mask autism symptoms in order to adhere to social norms.) </p><p>My friend from Oklahoma voiced her own frustration with this, explaining that her daughter had to see multiple professionals before finding someone who truly understood. Taking matters into my own hands, I turned to Google and found a highly qualified specialist in Arizona. I set up an appointment, did a two-hour consultation, and in the first five minutes of us connecting, the specialist literally described my whole world. Telehealth made it possible for me to receive the support I needed, despite the specialist being out of state.</p><p>Here’s what that was like: Being on teams, having to do events, being around a lot of people, I just felt overwhelmed. I didn’t know how to describe it other than I go to these events, I’m exhausted, and I just need quiet time after I am surrounded by people. It just kind of brought me back to remembering what I felt like as a kid. I joke that I’m kind of like a female Forrest Gump. I put the blinders on when I go to these events, and there’s all this noise, and people, and hoopla and the lights. Since I was a kid, it’s like I'm a horse having to put blinders on to block it all out. </p><p>That was kind of how I’ve coped my whole life going into these things. It’s like okay, I kind of have to get into my headspace, block it all out, and then just have lots of recovery time after I do it.</p><p>Reflecting on my childhood, I also remember feeling overstimulated and scared in crowded settings. I joke that when I was a kid, my world sounded like the teacher from the<em> Peanuts</em> cartoons. There were all these people talking, and it always sounded like noise to me. I always tried to avoid being around a lot of people because it was so confusing and overwhelming.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coming to terms with my neurodivergence </h2><p>Over the past year and a half, I have reached out to various mental health professionals. Each new connection has provided me with valuable insights. I met with another guide last year, recommended by a friend, and that was a great experience. I also worked with a sports psychologist leading up to the six-day race. With each consultation, I keep finding another piece of the puzzle that helps to elevate me even higher in my autism journey. </p><p>Discovering that many of my quirks and routines were manifestations of my autism and ADHD made me feel liberated. On a daily basis, my husband and I notice my quirks and say, "There's the autism" or "There's the ADHD." We always kind of knew I had these quirks, but now we're pointing them out and noticing them more. One significant realization for me was my body’s dysregulated circadian rhythms. I describe myself as “time blind,” where my sleep, running, and eating habits are irregular regardless of the time of day.</p><p>Knowing my body is kind of abnormal and dysregulated gives me peace. I don't have to feel stressed if I want to go to bed at three in the morning or eat at four in the afternoon. I don't have to fit into a neurotypical day-to-day pattern because that's just not how I'm wired. Reflecting on my journey, I understand the challenges I faced and the traits that fueled my success.</p><p>I feel like I’ve achieved a lot and had a lot of success, but I had to work hard throughout my life. I was diagnosed as a kid with a central auditory processing disorder. I couldn’t talk, and I didn’t want to be bullied for being different. I knew I was different from the beginning. From a young age, I wanted to work hard to overcome my inability to communicate. My journey has given me a platform to connect with parents of children with similar struggles. </p><p>Since being diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, I've had so many parents thank me because they are experiencing the same thing with their children. I couldn't talk much as a kid, but now I can communicate what was going on in my head. I feel empowered to share my childhood experiences, helping parents understand their non-verbal children.</p><p>As an adult, I continue to learn the importance of self-care and advocating for myself. However, I also understand the need to prioritize my mental well-being and address my personal needs more diligently.  Being a public figure, I have a platform and a voice. It feels good to advocate for the autism and ADHD communities and for late-diagnosed females. I hope my story encourages more women to seek answers and understand themselves better.</p><strong>More from Flow Space</strong></main>
