    <main><h1>Guide To Treating Mixed Connective Tissue Disease</h1><h2>Medication For Pulmonary Hypertension</h2><p>It is important to get medication for pulmonary hypertension because it is one of the most common conditions associated with mixed connective tissue disease. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure that occurs in the arteries leading to the lungs. It results in the heart having to work harder to do its job and pump blood through the lungs. This happens because a hardening and narrowing of the blood vessels occur. </p><p>Therefore, it is important to find a medication that will control the high blood pressure and allow the blood to be pumped between the heart and lungs. Without this medication, patients can suffer significant side effects like chest pain, shortness of breath, tiredness, and even death. Pulmonary hypertension is serious and can significantly reduce the lifespan of the patient because it can weaken their heart and affect their ability to engage in physical activity.</p><figure><img title="Medication For Pulmonary Hypertension" src="IMG/BB1lpXAk_medication_for_pulmonary_hypertension.jpg" alt="Medication For Pulmonary Hypertension"><figcaption><em>Medication For Pulmonary Hypertension.

The blood vessels in the hands or feet spasm in response to the cold. The fingers and toes can also have a blueish or white color to them because they are so cold. This kind of response is called Raynaud's disease. This symptom can cause the fingers or toes to become purplish blue and after getting them warm, they might appear red.</p><p>Additionally, the coldness can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty using the fingers. Therefore, patients must make sure they try not to expose them to any additional cold and keep them as warm as possible, especially in the winter. Patients will want to make sure they keep blood flowing to their fingers and toes so their skin is not damaged, and symptoms are kept to a minimum. There are different things individuals with this symptom of mixed connective tissue disease can do to try to keep warm. They can wear gloves, especially when outside, or use hand warmer packs in their shoes or gloves.</p><figure><img title="Protecting Hands From Cold Temperatures" src="IMG/AA1niKcO_protecting_hands_from_cold_temperatures.jpg" alt="Protecting Hands From Cold Temperatures"><figcaption><em>Protecting Hands From Cold Temperatures.

It is important to begin reducing stress because it will help with this side effect of mixed connective tissue disease. The extreme fluctuations can be painful, stressful, and very uncomfortable. So, while trying to keep their fingers or toes warm, patients also need to reduce any stress they feel. It might be easier said than done to reduce stress. However, patients can try some relaxation techniques to reduce stress, like yoga. Stress can manifest itself in many different ways and you need to help manage them in the best way possible. Patients should also discuss it with a doctor because they will be able to help guide them in the right direction.</p><figure><img title="Reducing Stress" src="IMG/AA1niy3g_reducing_stress.jpg" alt="Reducing Stress"><figcaption><em>Reducing Stress.

Channel blockers will help the muscles that make up the blood vessels relax and be able to pump blood easier. This can be used to help alleviate some of Raynaud disease's symptoms. Medications like this might be used only during a flare-up, but in more serious cases, medications might need to be taken on an ongoing basis. </p><p>All medications and any supplements should be managed by a doctor so they can make sure the patient is getting all the relief possible. There might be something patients are taking that really is not doing anything to manage their symptoms. Conversely, there might be different medications patients can try that will provide more relief from the symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease.</p><figure><img title="Calcium Channel Blockers" src="IMG/AA1niNU7_calcium_channel_blockers.jpg" alt="Calcium Channel Blockers"><figcaption><em>Calcium Channel Blockers.

It can also be used to manage flare-ups in patients with mixed connective tissue disease and is helpful in situations where different symptoms present themselves. Antimalarial drugs are usually best suited for mild cases of mixed connective tissue disease and less effective in more severe cases.</p><p>It is important for patients to let their doctor know when they experience flare-ups and what has successfully worked in the past. Even though medications cannot cure the disease, they can help manage it so patients can continue on in their lives with some degree of relief.</p></main>
