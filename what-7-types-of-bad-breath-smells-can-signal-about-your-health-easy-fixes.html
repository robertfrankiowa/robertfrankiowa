    <main><h1>What 7 Types of Bad Breath Smells Can Signal About Your Health + Easy Fixes</h1><p>Sometimes, bad breath simply comes down to not having a chance to brush after a particularly strong-smelling meal (we're looking at you, tuna sandwich with onion). But did you know that some types of bad breath smells can clue you in to underlying health issues? Here's what you need to know about those unwanted odors and what they may be trying to tell you.</p><h2>Not all types of bad breath smells are caused by lack of brushing</h2><p>"The most common cause of bad breath is bacterial build-up on the tongue, teeth and gums, and the cause of that is usually poor oral hygiene practices," says Tampa, FL-based dentist Brandon Mack, DDS. When food particles and plaque hang around in your mouth, the bacteria that live there go into a feeding frenzy and multiply like crazy. And the more bad bacteria that build up, the worse your breath gets. </p><p>But unpleasant odors don't always come down to forgetting to brush or floss. "There are incidents where other systemic issues are causing chronic bad breath," Dr. Mack adds. And sometimes, particular types of bad breath smells can even clue you in to what might be going on with the rest of your body. </p><h2>7 types of bad breath smells: Causes + cures</h2><p>Here's how to sniff out the most common types of bad breath smells, plus what you can do to make your breath smell fresher. Frequent offenders include:</p><h3>1. Dry mouth</h3><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Fishy or rotten eggs</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>Dry mouth means you're not making enough saliva, which "acts as a buffer in the mouth" to rinse away food bits and bacteria, Dr. Mack says. Without a steady supply of saliva, bad bacteria can build up and cause an odor or leave a funky taste in your mouth. This is one of the most common types of bad breath smells.</p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>Sip hot or iced tea made with fresh ginger slices and a spoonful of honey. Drinking more fluids keeps your mouth tissues hydrated, Dr. Mack says. And honey and ginger help your mouth make more saliva, per a <em>Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry</em> study. </p><p>Dry mouth can have a number of different causes, including certain meds, diabetes, snoring, mouth breathing and aging. Let your doctor know if it's a persistent problem so you can treat the root cause, Dr. Mack says.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Woman's World" src="IMG/BB1p7Flr_a_cup_of_tea_beside_fresh_ginger_and_honey_which_can_help_eliminate_common_types_of_bad_breath_smells.jpg" alt="A cup of tea beside fresh ginger and honey, which can help eliminate common types of bad breath smells"><figcaption><em>A cup of tea beside fresh ginger and honey, which can help eliminate common types of bad breath smells.

Tooth or gum infection</h3><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Fishy or rotten eggs</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>Tooth or gum infections often stem from slack brushing habits. They happen when bad bacteria build up around a cavity or the lining of your gums. That can lead to a strong odor, along with a bitter, salty or metallic taste in your mouth, says Los Angeles, CA-based dentist Ilona Casellini, DMD. The odor is usually accompanied by pain in the affected area, swelling, redness and even pus. </p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>See your dentist if you think you have a gum or tooth infection. They'll do a deep cleaning procedure called scaling and root planing to remove bacterial buildup under your gum line. Plus they'll prescribe antibiotics to nix the root cause of the infection, Dr. Casellini adds. If you have an infected tooth, you may also need a root canal. </p><h3>3. Keto diet</h3><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Fruity, unusually sweet or nail polish remover</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>When it comes to types of bad breath smells, this one has become more common in recent years. Ultra low-carb diets put your body into ketosis, a state where you burn fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. Stinky chemicals called ketones are a byproduct of this fat-burning process, and they get released when you exhale, Dr. Casellini explains. You might also have a metallic taste in your mouth, feel sluggish, have a headache or have an upset stomach, especially when you first start following a keto diet.  </p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>Good news: Ketosis symptoms tend to ease up within a few weeks as your body adjusts to your new diet. In the meantime, make it a point to sip extra water throughout the day. "Increasing your water intake flushes ketones from the body," so less of them come out through your breath, Dr. Casellini says. Reach for more fermented foods, too. Options like yogurt, sauerkraut and miso soup serve up good bacteria that may help combat stinky breath, suggests a <em>BMJ Open</em> review.</p><h3>4. Dentures that aren't clean or that fit poorly</h3><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Fishy or rotten eggs</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>Little bits of food and plaque can build up on your dentures when they're not cleaned regularly. Food bits can also get trapped under your dentures when they don't fit right, Dr. Casellini notes.  </p><p>Either way, as the food sits there, the bacteria in your mouth starts to ferment it. And that leads to an unpleasant smell, she adds. Both problems can also end up irritating your gums, and in some cases, lead to an infection.  </p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>First, be fastidious about keeping your dentures sparkly clean. "Take them out twice daily to brush your gums and clean your dentures with a denture cleaner," Dr. Casellini recommends. (Try Polident 3 Minute Denture Cleanser Tablets) When you aren't able to do a full brush and clean, remove your dentures and give them a quick rinse under cool running water (hot water can make them warp), she says.</p><p>And let your dentist know if your dentures don't fit right. They can adjust the dentures to make sure they sit around your gumline correctly. This gives you a tighter seal to keep food particles and bacteria out, Dr. Casellini adds. </p><h3>5. Acid Reflux or GERD</h3><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Sour or tangy</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>When you have acid reflux or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is basically acid reflux that happens regularly) digestive juices and partially-digested bits of food flow up into your esophagus, throat or mouth. That gives you that uncomfortable heartburn feeling and can give your breath a sour odor, Dr. Mack says. In fact, people with GERD are nearly 13 times more likely to report having bad breath than those without the condition, found a study in the <em>Journal of General Internal Medicine</em>. </p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>Getting your reflux under control will help your breath smell better, Dr. Mack says. Lifestyle changes like avoiding trigger foods (citrus, spicy or fatty foods, garlic, onions, tomatoes, alcohol or caffeine), having an earlier dinner, eating smaller meals and sleeping with your head elevated can all make a difference. If those aren't enough, your doctor may recommend over-the-counter or prescription meds to limit or block acid production. </p><figure><img title="Provided by Woman's World" src="IMG/BB1p7KsA_a_mature_woman_sleeping_on_an_extra_pillow_in_bed.jpg" alt="A mature woman sleeping on an extra pillow in bed"><figcaption><em>A mature woman sleeping on an extra pillow in bed.

Diabetes</h3><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Sweet, fruity or vinegar-y (like nail polish remover)</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>When a person's diabetes isn't well-controlled and their insulin levels are too low, their body can start to burn fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. That leads to the production of ketones, which can make your breath smell sweet or fruity (similar to being on a keto diet). The difference? With diabetes, these ketones can quickly build up in a person's bloodstream and cause diabetic ketoacidosis. This life-threatening condition is marked by dangerously high blood sugar. Other symptoms include extreme thirst, having to urinate more often, stomach pain or vomiting, fatigue, shortness of breath or confusion. </p><p><strong>What to do:</strong> Following your diabetes treatment plan, including eating a healthy diet and taking your prescribed meds, is key for managing your blood sugar. Also aim to get 25 to 35 g of fiber daily from foods like whole grains, beans, fruits and vegetables. Eating high-fiber meals can stave off stinky breath for nearly 3 hours, one <em>Swiss Dental Journal</em> study found. Just as important, high-fiber fare supports steady blood sugar levels. </p><p>Note: If you're having symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, seek immediate medical attention. Insulin, fluids and electrolytes can help get your blood sugar levels back in a healthier range.</p><p><strong>What it smells like: </strong>Stale or sulfur-like</p><p><strong>Why it happens: </strong>In terms of types of bad breath smells, it's no surprise that smoking makes the list. Smoking dries out your mouth while upping the risk of gum or tooth infections, both of which can mess with your breath, Dr. Mack says. Tobacco also produces sulfur-containing compounds that can build up in your mouth and waft out when you exhale, according to <em>Toxicology Reports </em>research.   </p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>"Quitting smoking is the best thing to do" to manage bad breath and improve your health, Dr. Mack says. While you work on it (your doctor can help), reach for breath fresheners when you get the urge to put something in your mouth. Chewing gum boosts saliva production to keep your mouth more hydrated, Dr. Mack says. Your doctor might recommend starting with a nicotine gum then gradually transitioning to sugar-free gum. </p><p><strong>More ways to keep your mouth healthy and breath fresh:</strong></p><p>These Easy, Surprising Self-Care Tips Can Reverse Gum Disease, Say Dentists</p><p>Brushing With Your Opposite Hand Helps Stop Receding Gums + More Dentist-Backed Tricks</p><p>Top Dentists Reveal How to Stop Sensitive Teeth Pain - Fast! </p><p><em>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
