She recommends "eating nutritionally dense foods" and "making protein a high priority." And, while you don't need to eliminate them, she suggests sticking to an "appropriate" amount of carbs and fats.</p><h2>2 Do Progressive Overload Strength Training</h2><p>As for exercise, she recommends progressive overload strength training. "I do 5-6 days a week. Commit to what lt you can and stay consistent with it," Alicia recommends.</p><h2>3 Walk 8,000 to 10,000</h2><p>She also suggests daily walking. "I aim for 8-10k steps," she says. "If you have a certain cardio form you love, do it! I love walking!" Another workout she loves? Dancing too. "I keep it LISS because my body loves it and I want the üí™."</p><h2>4 Cut or Limit Refined Sugar and Alcohol</h2><p>Next, "cut or limit refined sugar and alcohol," Alicia says. "I personally had to cut it because it's very habit-forming for me. I enjoy coconut sugar, monkfruit, honey, and stevia. Figure out what works best for you!"</p><h2>5 Hydrate</h2><p>Don't forget to hydrate! "I drink half of my body weight (lbs) in ounces of water daily. I also throw in an electrolyte pack while I'm working out," Alicia says.</p><h2>6 Sleep</h2><p>And finally, "sleep has to be a priority," Alicia says. "7-8 hours a night. This is how your body recovers and resets."</p><figure><img title="6 Sleep" src="IMG/AA1nE1jg_6_sleep.jpg" alt="6 Sleep"><figcaption><em>6 Sleep. ¬© Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>7 You Can Tweak These</h2><p>"These are the basics! Everyone will have their own unique tweaks to this," she continues. "Maybe you want to track macros for a certain goal. Or maybe tracking is not your jam, so you eyeball, and that's ok with you," Alicia says.</p><figure><img title="7 You Can Tweak These" src="IMG/BB1pgN75_7_you_can_tweak_these.jpg" alt="7 You Can Tweak These"><figcaption><em>7 You Can Tweak These. ¬© Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>8 Be Honest With Yourself</h2><p>"Maybe you don't want to completely cut out alcohol and enjoy a drink occasionally. Do what is going to work best for you, but also be honest with yourself about what you KNOW is not working," she says.</p><figure><img title="8 Be Honest With Yourself" src="IMG/BB1pgRAD_8_be_honest_with_yourself.jpg" alt="8 Be Honest With Yourself"><figcaption><em>8 Be Honest With Yourself. ¬© Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>9 Remember, It's a Process</h2><p>"Getting in tune with our bodies is a process. Being honest with ourselves is a process. Do you need to give yourself some tough love when it comes to changing certain habits? Or do you need to give yourself a little grace?" she writes.</p><h2>10 You Can "Get Better with Age"</h2><p>"At the end of the day, you're the one living in your mind and body forever. Make it the best little temple you can! I share what has worked for me for inspiration and hopefully to simplify. Yes, ladies, we can get better with age!!!" she concludes.
