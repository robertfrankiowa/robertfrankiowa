    <main><h1>13 Healthy Foods That Everyone Must Include in Their Diets ASAP</h1><p><p>Everyone wants to be healthier (or at least I assume so). One of the most important ways to be healthier is to eat healthy foods and get the vitamins and nutrients you need from food. You should try to include these healthy foods in your diet as much as possible. </p><p>It is in everyone's best interest to eat healthier foods if they want to live long and healthy lives. Here are some of the most nutritious foods that everyone should include in their diet.</p><figure><img title="13 Healthy Foods That Everyone Must Include in Their Diets ASAP" src="IMG/BB1pyw66_13_healthy_foods_that_everyone_must_include_in_their_diets_asap.jpg" alt="13 Healthy Foods That Everyone Must Include in Their Diets ASAP"><figcaption><em>13 Healthy Foods That Everyone Must Include in Their Diets ASAP.

Furthermore, they are also high in fiber, which is great for digestion.</p><h2>Whole Grains</h2><p>Whole grains such as oats, rye, barley, buckwheat, rice, and quinoa, to name a few, are far better choices than refined carbs as they are loaded with fiber and other nutrients, including iron, B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc.</p><h2>Dates</h2><p>Dates are great if you are craving something sweet. As opposed to candy and processed sugary foods, they are packed with potassium, which can help manage healthy blood pressure levels.</p><h2>Pineapple</h2><p>Pineapple is enriched with vitamin C, which supports the heart by fighting free radicals. Essentially, this means that it helps fight molecules that may damage heart cells.</p><figure><img title="Pineapple" src="IMG/BB1m6Wk2_pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple"><figcaption><em>Pineapple.

This food is, however, high in calories, so be sure you don't go overboard when consuming this food. A spoonful of peanut butter a day is great to add healthy fats and a bit of protein to your diet!</p><figure><img title="Peanut Butter" src="IMG/BB1m6TFt_peanut_butter.jpg" alt="Peanut Butter"><figcaption><em>Peanut Butter.

But when you take a bite of one of these fruits or vegetables without washing them, you might make a bit of a mistake. </p><p>That’s because eating one of these without washing them can give you a bit more than you bargained for! So next time you reach for that fruit (or vegetable), wash it properly first!</p></main>
