    <main><h1>15 Overpriced Health Retreats That Aren’t Worth the Splurge</h1><p>Being health conscious typically comes at a cost — especially if you want to incorporate it into your vacation. Some wellness resorts are notorious for charging high prices for basic accommodations, extra fees for treatments, and poor customer service, even at exclusive retreats. </p><p>Disappointment over value is a frequent theme in reviews. Vacationers imagine themselves lounging in cotton robes, citrus water in hand, cucumbers on eyes, serenaded by the sounds of monkeys and birds. But instead, they’re met with the complete opposite and leave feeling regretful instead of refreshed. </p><p>There are many retreats worth the splurge, but it’s best to avoid these 15 popular but overpriced health retreats that, despite their steep costs, may not provide the expected value.</p><h2>1. The Ashram, California</h2><p>The resort maintains a strict schedule, including pre-dawn wakeups, 12-mile hikes, and mandatory weight classes. There is no cell signal in this wilderness area, so it’s easy to feel stuck. If self-torture is your thing, you may enjoy it, but otherwise, steer clear of this place. </p><h2>2. SHA Wellness Clinic, Spain</h2><p>They offer advanced medical wellness treatments, but these come with additional fees. Since wellness retreats are typically all about rest and relaxation, this place is somewhat of a letdown, as guests struggle to get comfortable enough to truly unwind. </p><h2>3. Canyon Ranch, Arizona</h2><p>Reviews mention the food not being up to par for the price. If you go here, expect to spend more than you originally planned. </p><h2>4. Golden Door, California</h2><p>There are other luxurious retreats in the area, offering similar services at a lower pricepoint. Overall, Golden Door isn’t offering anything truly special or unique, so visitors sometimes hesitate to return again. </p><h2>5. Chiva-Som, Thailand</h2><p>The resort does offer luxurious amenities and services, but these do cost extra, so combining the expense of the treatments with the accommodation fees makes it seem overpriced. The facilities are beautiful, but so are many other hotels and resorts in the region, and many of those offer lower prices. </p><figure><img title="5.

Kamalaya, Thailand</h2><p>However, the accommodations are frequently referred to as ‘basic’ in reviews, and as with Chiva-Som, the treatments cost extra. It’s not a comprehensive resort, either, so some treatments and amenities are missing. </p><h2>7. Ananda in the Himalayas, India</h2><p>That’s not the case here, as there are additional fees for pretty much everything. Some vacationers feel it wasn’t worth the expense, as these added costs quickly pile up. </p><h2>8. Amanpuri, Thailand</h2><p>There is no question that Amanpuri is stunning. But what is questionable is the high cost. </p><h2>9. Cal-a-Vie Health Spa, California</h2><p>Vacationers feel the customer service and quality of treatments aren’t worth it. While many wellness spas in this state are pricey, there are certainly alternatives that offer a better experience. </p><figure><img title="9. Cal-a-Vie Health Spa, California" src="IMG/BB1oRF5W_9_cal_a_vie_health_spa_california.jpg" alt="9. Cal-a-Vie Health Spa, California"><figcaption><em>9. Cal-a-Vie Health Spa, California.

Located near the Himalayan foothills, it’s not exactly easy to get to either. </p><figure><img title="10. Vana, India" src="IMG/BB1oRK5N_10_vana_india.jpg" alt="10. Vana, India"><figcaption><em>10. Vana, India. Image Credit: Six Senses Vana.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>11. The Ranch Malibu, California</h2><p>They offer rigorous fitness programs and low-fat, healthy food options. Those who stay here sometimes feel the accommodations are basic, and the restrictive food choices are stifling. There are other fitness-oriented vacations which offer more luxury at a better price. </p><figure><img title="11. The Ranch Malibu, California" src="IMG/BB1oRB50_11_the_ranch_malibu_california.jpg" alt="11. The Ranch Malibu, California"><figcaption><em>11. The Ranch Malibu, California.

Among them is Viceroy Bali, which is located in a stunning setting and offers high-end amenities. While it’s definitely a beautiful place to be, visitors question the value of it, as the treatments and programs can be costly. </p><p>Though the amenities feel high end, there are other resorts nearby which offer even more luxury at a better price point. </p><h2>13. Aro Ha Wellness Retreat, New Zealand</h2><p>The goal is to help their visitors get healthy, but the method in which they do this feels restrictive and overpriced. Set in the middle of nature, the feel is very rustic, and that turns a lot of visitors off. </p><h2>14. SHA Wellness Clinic, Mexico</h2><p>This is another resort that has a more clinical atmosphere, where guests feel they are staying in a medical facility rather than a relaxing environment. Additional fees for treatments add up, and guests might leave the stay feeling it wasn’t worth the price. </p><h2>15. Clinique La Prairie, Switzerland</h2><p>Their treatments are focused on overall wellness, with some being quite advanced. Many of their treatments are not scientifically proven to do anything, so it is a risk, but the placebo affect is real. Still, guests sometimes come away from their stay here feeling it wasn’t worth the exorbitant price. </p></main>
