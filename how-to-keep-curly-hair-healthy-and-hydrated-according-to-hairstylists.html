    <main><h1>How to Keep Curly Hair Healthy and Hydrated, According to Hairstylists</h1><p>Curly hair is beautiful, but caring for it can be a bit complex. "Curly hair has endless patterns, densities, and textures," hairstylist Justin Toves-Vincilione says. "There are so many different types of curly hair that it truly takes an expert to be able to understand every characteristic."</p><p>Nailing down the perfect routine takes trial and error, often requiring you to experiment with countless products and styling methods along the way. However, we asked a few expert stylists to share tips that will make maintaining your curly hair easier. Ahead, find everything you need to know about caring for curly hair.</p><p><h3>Meet the Experts</h3><ul><li>Justin Toves-Vincilione is a professional hairstylist, Authentic Beauty Concepts ambassador, and member of the Ulta Beauty design team.</li><li>Stephanie Angelone is a master stylist at The Salon Project in NYC.</li></ul><h2>What Is Curly Hair?</h2><p>Curly hair is far from monolithic. "All curls have different curl patterns, which makes every head of curly hair different," The Salon Project master stylist Stephanie Angelone says. "It includes loose waves, soft curls, tight curls, and ringlets," she adds.</p><p>But what <em>actually</em> makes hair curl? Angelone explains that "straight hair has bonds evenly distributed on each side of the hair shaft. Curly hair has bonds that are distributed more on one side, which causes the hair to curl when growing from the scalp." Toves-Vincilione adds that coarseness of texture, or lack thereof, also plays an important role, saying that "most coarse textures, straight or curly, have a unique layer at the core of each strand called the medulla."</p><p>The distance from scalp to ends isn't a straight road for curly hair, either. "One of the biggest differences in curly hair is that the ends tend to lack moisture because of its spiral formation(loose or tight). This is because it is almost impossible for the scalp's natural oils to travel down each spiral formation," Toves-Vincilione explains.</p><h2>What Are Common Curly Hair Challenges?</h2><h3>Dryness</h3><p>Curly hair is prone to dryness. "Dryness is the number one challenge when it comes to curly hair, so my go-to tip is to apply plenty of product," Toves-Vincilione says." Our experts recommend using a sufficient amount of your favorite hydrating conditioner, detangler, leave-in conditioner, and styling products.</p><h3>Frizz</h3><p>Dryness is often accompanied by frizz. You can smooth frizz and flyaways by using enough product in your styling routine. "When applying moisturizing conditioners or treatments, apply plenty of product, work in sections for max absorption, and detangle as you go for even distribution," says Toves-Vincilione. He adds that you should always "allow time for [these products] to do their thing. Rinsing products out too soon is counterproductive, especially on low porosity curl types."</p><h2>How to Wash Curly Hair</h2><p>Curly hair shouldn't be washed as often as straight hair, or it can dry out quickly. Generally, once a week is sufficient, but it's best to assess the state of your hair to determine your wash day cadence. Once you're ready to wash, you might want to consider pre-shampooing first. "This is a great way to lock in moisture before doing your regular shampoo and conditioner routine in the shower," Angelone says. You can use a dedicated pre-shampoo or opt for a co-wash instead.</p><p>Once you've detangled and rinsed out your pre-treatment, move on to shampooing and conditioning. Angelone says always to use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner. When shampooing, Toves-Vincilione says it's important to work slowly. "Focus on the scalp rather than the ends," he explains. "Working in sections will help ensure the scalp is completely cleansed." For conditioning, Angelone recommends "leaving [the product on your hair] for a few minutes and combing it through with wide tooth comb to distribute it evenly and keep hair detangled."</p><h2>How to Style and Maintain Curly Hair</h2><p>You can choose to let your curls air dry or speed up the process with a hooded dryer or diffuser. If you decide on the latter, ensure you've applied a heat protectant to shield your curls from damage.</p><p>In the days after your wash day, your curls may lose volume, frizz up, and become dry. However, there are a few ways to preserve your natural hair. Sleeping with a satin or silk pillowcase can reduce friction and moisture loss. It can also help your curls keep their shape. Alternatively, you can wear a bonnet or wrap your hair in a scarf.</p><h2>The Final Takeaway</h2><p>Maintaining curly hair requires intentionality at every step, from washing to styling. However, while every head of curls is unique, there are definitely a few tips that will work across the board. Our experts recommend using hydrating products from start to finish—this means selecting shampoos, conditioners, and stylers made with curly hair in mind. They also suggest protecting your hair while you sleep. In other words, keeping your hair wrapped in a satin or silk scarf and sleeping on a pillowcase made from either fabric is a must. Bottom line: Establishing a proper curl routine takes time, but once you do, your curls will be incredibly healthy and hydrated.</p><p>  Up Next: The Best Hair Routine for Curly Hair of 2023 </p>
