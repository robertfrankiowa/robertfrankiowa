For instance, if you have type 2 diabetes or a family history of lung cancer, smoking is off the table. If you’re a heart patient, you need to avoid certain foods that can exacerbate your condition, like processed meats. </p><p>But what is something you should never, ever do when you have hepatitis C? Ahead, doctors will share their answers to this question, and spoiler alert—there’s <em>more than</em> one thing you should never, ever do when you’ve been diagnosed with hepatitis C. </p><h2>What Is Hepatitis C?</h2><p>In case you’re not aware, simply put, hepatitis C is a viral infection that can bring on swelling of the liver, among other problems. </p><p>As <strong>Dr. Anurag Maheshwari, MD</strong>, a Gastroenterologist and Transplant Hepatologist who specializes in liver disease at The Center for Liver and Hepatobiliary Diseases in Baltimore, Maryland, puts it, it’s something that the body is frequently unable to get rid of, “therefore, it turns into a chronic disease with the virus in the liver.”</p><p><strong>Dr. William Carey, MD</strong>, Acting Hepatology Section Head and Professor of Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, adds that if left untreated over the course of many years, hepatitis C can result in fibrosis (or scar tissue) of the liver, cirrhosis, liver failure and even liver cancer.</p><p>“Hepatitis C is spread typically through contaminated needles, needles shared during drug use, shared in tattooing, piercings, dental work, etc.,” Dr. Maheshwari says. “Any procedure which involves the use of contaminated needles being shared from one person to another will see the infection spread from one to another.” </p><p>Also, hepatitis C usually has no symptoms. Dr. Maheshwari says that the few who do experience symptoms may have fatigue, minor aches and pains, and skin rashes.</p><p>Luckily, according to <strong>Raffi Karagozian, MD</strong>, Hepatologist at Tufts Medical Center, hepatitis C is easily diagnosed by common and readily available laboratory testing. </p><h2>What to Never, Ever Do With Hepatitis C</h2><p>As previously mentioned, there isn't <em>just</em> one thing that you should never, ever do if you have hepatitis C. But our medical experts did share the things that top all their lists. </p><p>Firstly, Dr. Maheshwari advises patients to stay away from alcohol. </p><p>“Because drinking alcohol when you have hepatitis C is akin to pouring fuel on the fire,” he explains. “The combination of the two causes exponential damage to the liver, exceeding what would be experienced by the damage each, alcohol and hepatitis C, can cause alone. When someone with hepatitis C drinks alcohol, they have a much faster progression toward liver cirrhosis and subsequently, liver cancer.” </p><p>Dr. Karagozian says that since hepatitis C is a blood to blood contact infectious disease, donation of blood by active hepatitis C carriers is not allowed, which is the thing that tops his list. He also says, “Hepatitis C patients should never share razors or needles, as this will increase the risk of transferring the virus. There is a significant risk of spreading hepatitis C if any exposure of blood products from a hepatitis C patient occurs.” </p><p>For Dr. Carey, he stresses the importance of not ignoring the infection just because it doesn’t cause symptoms, and perhaps your liver enzymes are remaining normal. “Get treated,” he emphasizes. </p><h2>Things That Those with Hepatitis C Should Do</h2><p>Then there are the things you <em>should</em> do if you’ve been diagnosed with hepatitis C. First of all, as Dr. Carey points out, hepatitis C is nearly 100% curable with pills. “Every person should seek treatment whether there are symptoms or not,” he stresses.</p><p>Additionally, Dr. Maheshwari says that it’s important to take sensible precautions—this includes not sharing needles, razors or toothbrushes. </p><p>“However, those with hepatitis C should not be afraid of transmitting the virus through casual contact, like kissing, hugging, sharing food utensils, towels, bed linens, toilets and so forth,” he explains. “There is an unfortunate stigma associated with hepatitis C, and a fear of transmitting the infection that is not warranted in such cases of casual contact.” </p></main>
