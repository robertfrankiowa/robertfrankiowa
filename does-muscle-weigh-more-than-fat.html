    <main><h1>Does Muscle Weigh More Than Fat?</h1><p><strong>POV: YOU'VE REALLY</strong> crushing your workouts, and have supported your efforts with healthy meals to match. And, for some reason, your bathroom scale tells you you've gained weight. To investigate, you get a body composition scan done, to find that you've lost fat, but gained muscle. So, why has your weight gone up? Does muscle weigh more than fat? </p><p>"The scale doesn't tell the full story," says Brett Warner, P.T., D.P.T., C.S.C.S., physical therapist at Bespoke Treatments in NYC. Your body composition, or the ratio of fat, muscle, and bone in your body, determines more about your health than the number glaring back at you on the scale. </p><p>These substances have different densities. While someone might have a greater fat percentage, they may weigh less than someone with a large muscle percentage. Experts explain ever confusing math problem, below. </p><h2 class="body-h2">Does muscle weigh more than fat? </h2><p>Take a think back to elementary school science class. A pound of cement and a pound of feathers balance on a mass scale, but the pound of feathers takes up way more space. That's because the cement is more dense than the feathers. The same is true in regards to muscle and fat. </p><p>"Muscle is more dense than fat, therefore it takes a smaller volume of muscle than fat to equal the same weight," Warner says. "Because of this, someone can be slimmer with a lower body fat percentage, and weigh more than someone who is lighter with a higher body fat percentage."</p><p>An increase in the weight is generally followed by worry. But, if the number on the scale is going up in response to gaining muscle mass, that's actually a good thing. That's why it's important to understand your body composition, instead of just your weight. </p><h2 class="body-h2">How does body composition attribute to overall health? </h2><p>Having greater muscle tissue will translate to a higher base metabolism, or the amount of calories you burn at rest. That is because it takes more energy for your body to keep muscle mass active. </p><p>Sarcopenia, which is the loss of muscle mass and strength, begins in our 30s, which can lead to weakness, difficulties with balance and joint stability, and limit our ability to perform daily tasks. This can put our independence as risk as we gain. The more lean body mass you have, the longer you can retain that functioning, Warner says. Sarcopenia is a naturally occurring phenomenon that can only be reversed by intentional strength training. </p><p>Having too high of a body fat percentage can increase your risk of certain diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. And, while we often aim for a low body fat percentage, there are risks that come with having too low a level of body fat, including poor energy levels, decreased bone density, and potential heart problems. </p><h2 class="body-h2">What is considered a healthy body composition? </h2><p>Men should aim to keep their body fat percentage around 14 to 24 percent, and females should aim for 20 to 30 percent, Warner says. </p><p>Athletes may need less, but females should never drop below 10 percent, and males should never drop below 5 percent, "in order to maintain the minimum amount of fat tissue required for essential body functions." </p><h2 class="body-h2">How do I calculate my muscle and body fat percentages? </h2><p>Unfortunately, there are no perfect tried-and-true at-home solutions for calculating your body fat percentage. You'll have to visit a doctor or specialty studio to get a body composition scan done. </p><p>There are several kinds of tests, with varying degrees of accuracy. The most common are bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) scans, such as Inbody scans and body composition scales you can buy for your home. They are more widely available, but are pretty inaccurate. They utilize electrical currents to identify different materials in the body. Many gyms own some kind of BIA scan machine. </p><p>Skin fold calipers are one of the oldest routes of measurement. The test involves measuring pinched areas of fat around the body, which is then translated into an equation to pop out a body fat percentage. While technically can be done at home (the calipers themselves are relatively cheap and easy to get), the test require a large understanding of human anatomy, and a lot of practice. </p><p>There are other lab scans that are the most accurate form of measure. But, the more accurate they are, the most expensive they can be to obtain. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, hydrostatic weighing, and Bod Pod are all highly accurate tests. Different doctors offices and certain medical clinics and specialty wellness centers. Depending on your coverage, these scans can sometimes be covered by insurance if they're prescribed by a doctor. </p><figure><img title="Virojt Changyencham - Getty Images" src="IMG/BB1iVmV7_gettyimages_1015409276.jpg" alt="gettyimages-1015409276"><figcaption><em>gettyimages-1015409276.

A 2020 meta-data analysis from the <em>Strength and Conditioning Journal </em>suggests that it may be possible to lose fat mass and gain muscle at the same time, but the study was only done on young athletes, and might not translate to the rest of the population. And, doing both at one time isn't exactly optimal, Lee Boyce, C.S.C.S., an <em>Men's Health</em> Advisory Board member, told <em>MH</em>. It could mean a slower rate of change. </p><p>The most effective approach, Boyce says, is to prioritize muscle building over fat loss, because with muscle building habits may come some physiological responses that help burn away some fat anyway. Here's a few tips on how to do just that. </p><h4 class="body-h4">Tips for Increasing Muscle Mass</h4><p>Increasing muscle mass depends mostly on two things: strength training, and protein intake. </p><p>Strength training puts your muscles under tension, which creates micro-tears in your muscle tissue. To repair them, your body builds more fibers. </p><p>To build those extra fibers, though, the body needs sufficient protein intake. Protein is a macronutrient that assists in several bodily functions—one of the main ones being tissue development. For true muscle building, you'll want to be eating at least 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein for every kilogram of your target body weight. </p><p>That's a lot of protein—about 120 grams for someone who weights 165 pounds. To achieve that, aim for hitting at least 30 grams of protein at each meal, and at least two snacks a day that have an additional 20 grams. Find a protein powder you really enjoy (here's a few of our favorites), and get into a habit of using it in smoothies, or supplementing it as one of those snacks. </p><p>Losing fat is difficult in practice, but simple in theory: burn more calories than you take in. </p><p>That means making your calories count. Filling up on protein won't only help you build muscle—it will also help keep you fuller, long. That will help you keep your portions lighter, and limit your snacking throughout the day. </p><p>Prioritizing full-body, compound exercises in the gym will help you build muscle, and also burn more calories while you're working out. "Compound lift movements incorporate ton of muscles. You need to recruit a decent amount in order to elicit that hypertrophy response," says Kurt Ellis, N.S.C.A., of Beyond Numbers Performance, told <em>MH</em>. More muscle recruitment means your body needs more energy to power those movements—hence the extra calorie burn. </p><p>Find ways to fill your days with movement outside of the gym, too. Do walking meetings at work, or bike to the grocery store if you can. And, hone in on your active friends. Find people that want to go for a run with you instead of watch TV on the couch. Any extra movement means extra calorie burn, and bringing other people into the equation helps you stay accountable. </p><p>Try 200+ at home workout videos from Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Prevention, and more on All Out Studio free for 14 days!</p></main>
