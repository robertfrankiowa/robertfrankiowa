L-menthol blocks calcium channels that initiate contractions in smooth muscles, preventing the spasming that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea in people with IBS.</p><p>Mint also contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, which may benefit people with IBS by decreasing inflammation and cellular damage.</p><p>One review of 12 studies involving 835 people with IBS found that peppermint oil supplementation over a period of two to 12 weeks significantly improved symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and gas compared to placebo treatments.</p><p>One review of 96 studies found that, when used with other ingredients like caraway oil, peppermint oil supplements were effective for reducing certain symptoms of indigestion, including abdominal pain and abdominal pressure. Research on the effectiveness of peppermint supplements for treating indigestion is limited, and there's currently no evidence that mint-only treatments are effective for treating this condition.</p><h2>May Improve Cognitive Performance</h2><p>Some research suggests that peppermint oil supplements may improve cognitive performance.</p><p>Mint contains compounds that may boost cognitive function by interacting with certain neurotransmitters, like γ-aminobutyric acid(GABA), and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase(AChE). This enzyme breaks down a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which plays important roles in attention and memory.</p><p>One study involving 24 people found that treatment with a single dose of 100 microliters (µl) of peppermint oil improved cognitive test performance and reduced mental fatigue associated with extended cognitive task performance compared to a placebo treatment.</p><h2>Could Soothe Nausea</h2><p>Mint has a soothing aroma and smelling it may help reduce nausea symptoms. For example, studies show that mint aromatherapy may be helpful for reducing nausea and vomiting in people undergoing treatment for cancer.</p><p>Taking mint supplements may also be effective against certain types of nausea and vomiting. One study of 84 people with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy found that treatment with 40 drops of peppermint essential oil in water every eight hours significantly reduced nausea, vomiting, and low appetite at 24 and 48 hours after treatment compared to a placebo.</p><p>However, most studies investigating mint's effects on nausea and vomiting have focused on mint aromatherapy, not oral mint supplements.</p><h2>Might Boost Athletic Performance</h2><p>Though research is limited, some evidence suggests that mint supplements may be helpful for those looking for a natural way to improve stamina and power during exercise. Mint has antispasmodic properties and may help relax smooth muscles in the lungs and improve tissue oxygenation, which can support exercise performance.</p><p>One small study of 12 men found that treatment with 500 milliliters (ml) of mineral water containing 0.05 ml of peppermint essential oil for ten days significantly improved exercise performance, lung function, heart rate, and power during a treadmill exercise test compared to before the treatment.</p><p>Another study of 30 healthy men found that a single oral dose of 50 µl of peppermint essential oil significantly improved exercise performance and lung function parameters compared to a placebo treatment.</p><p>While these results are promising, more studies are needed to understand how oral mint supplements may benefit exercise performance.</p><h2>How To Use Mint Supplements</h2><p>Mint supplements are available in several forms, including capsules and liquids. Because dosing and use instructions vary, following the directions on the supplement label is important.</p><p>It's best to talk to your healthcare provider before using a mint supplement. This is especially important if you have a health condition like a digestive disorder.</p><p>Although mint supplements may be helpful for people with certain medical conditions, they're not appropriate or safe for everyone.</p><h3>Dosage</h3><p>Dosing recommendations for mint supplements vary depending on the type and what it's being used to treat.</p><p>For example, some research suggests that peppermint oil in doses of 50-100 µl may be effective for improving athletic performance and cognitive performance, respectively.</p><p>One study found that treatment with 182 milligrams (mg) of peppermint oil daily for eight weeks was effective for improving IBS symptoms.</p><p>Always speak with a healthcare provider for specific dosing advice.</p><h2>Is Mint Safe?</h2><p>Mint supplements are generally considered safe but aren't appropriate for everyone.</p><p>Because little is known about the safety of oral mint supplements during pregnancy and breastfeeding, it's best to avoid oral mint supplements during these stages of life.</p><p>Peppermint oil has been shown to be safe when taken in appropriate amounts. However, people with certain medical conditions, such as gallstones, hiatal hernia, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), should consult a healthcare provider before taking peppermint supplements.</p><h3>Potential Drug Interactions</h3><p>Mint supplements may interact with or increase the bioavailability of some commonly prescribed medications, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Blood pressure medications:</strong> Though human research is limited, peppermint oil may increase the bioavailability of certain blood pressure medications, like felodipine, increasing their effects in the body.</li><li><strong>Cytochrome P450 substrates:</strong> Some evidence suggests that peppermint oil may interact with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including the blood thinner Warfarin and the blood pressure medication metoprolol.</li><li><strong>Chemotherapy drugs:</strong> Peppermint oil may interfere with certain chemotherapy agents, like docetaxel and cisplatin.</li></ul><p>If you're taking one or more medications, it's important to consult your doctor before adding any new supplement into your routine, including mint products.</p><h3>What To Look For</h3><p>When shopping for a mint supplement, there are a few things to remember. </p><p>It’s important to choose high-quality products from trusted supplement brands. When possible, purchase mint supplements from companies certified by organizations like UL, USP, and NSF International, which set strict standards for supplement quality and safety.</p><p>Check with your healthcare provider before taking a mint supplement. Mint supplements aren't safe or appropriate for everyone and may interact with common medications</p><p>Though mint supplements are generally considered safe, extremely high doses can be toxic. For example, high doses of peppermint oil can cause kidney and liver injury and even lead to acute kidney failure. There have been cases of near-fatal peppermint oil overdoses.</p><p>Again: always consult a healthcare provider if you have any questions about supplement dosing.</p><h2>Side Effects of Mint</h2><p>Though mint supplements aren't associated with serious side effects when taken in appropriate doses, they may cause a few side effects.</p><p>Possible side effects related to taking mint supplements include:</p><ul><li>Heartburn</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Dry mouth</li><li>Dermatitis (skin inflammation)</li></ul><p>If you experience any side effects after taking a mint supplement, stop taking the supplement and contact your healthcare provider if the symptom doesn't resolve.</p><h2>Best Ways To Use Fresh Mint</h2><p>If you're interested in reaping the benefits of mint but don't want to take supplements, consider incorporating fresh mint into your diet.</p><p>Mint, like peppermint, has a refreshing taste and is high in protective plant compounds, like polyphenols, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the body.</p><p>Here are a few ways to use fresh mint:</p><ul><li>Chop up fresh mint and add it to green salads</li><li>Make a flavorful side dish using fresh mint, watermelon, and feta</li><li>Add fresh mint to water and cocktails</li><li>Use chopped mint in homemade pestos and dressings</li><li>Incorporate fresh mint into pasta dishes</li><li>Use fresh, chopped mint as a garnish for meat, chicken, and fish dishes</li></ul><p>Fresh and dried mint can also be used in desserts, like ice cream and baked goods. It pairs especially well with chocolate and can be used to make delicious chocolate-based recipes like cakes and cookies.</p><h2>A Quick Review</h2><p>Mint is a common ingredient in sweet and savory dishes and cocktails. When used as a dietary supplement, mint, including peppermint, may benefit health in several ways.</p><p>Studies show that mint supplements may improve symptoms of certain digestive conditions, like IBS, and may support exercise performance and cognitive function.</p><p>While mint supplements are generally considered safe, they're not the right choice for everyone and can lead to dangerous side effects when taken in high doses.</p></main>
