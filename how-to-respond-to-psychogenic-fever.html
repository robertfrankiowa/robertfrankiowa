    <main><h1>How to Respond to Psychogenic Fever</h1><p><p>Prolonged stress can have a major impact on your physical health</p><strong>Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD</strong><strong>Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD</strong><p>We know that too much stress is never a good thing. It keeps us up at night, makes us feel drained and affects our relationships with friends and family. In fact, stress can actually lead to a fever. Here’s what you need to know about psychogenic fever.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Mind" src="IMG/BB1oHirP_girl_sitting_on_the_sofa_at_home_with_her_hand_on_her_forehead.jpg" alt="girl sitting on the sofa at home with her hand on her forehead"><figcaption><em>Thai Liang Lim / E+ / Getty.

Instead, the fever is believed to be triggered by psychological factors, such as stress, anxiety, or emotional distress. This is just one of many ways that your mental and physical health can interact.</p><p>One study looked at the age distribution and gender differences of psychogenic fever in Japan. It showed that the highest number of cases occurred for 13-year-olds. The study found that psychogenic fever is more common among females. Although adolescents are more likely to experience psychogenic fever, it also occurs among adults.</p><h3>Causes and Symptoms of Psychogenic Fever</h3><p>Annie Miller, a licensed psychotherapist and the owner and founder of DC Metro Sleep and Psychotherapy with significant training in brain and psychologically-based symptoms explained that psychogenic fever stems from our complex mind-body connection. </p><p>Psychogenic symptoms are where psychological stressors manifest as physical symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, and even as an unexplained fever. Anxiety, trauma, and emotional distress can all contribute to the onset of psychogenic fever episodes.</p><h2>What's the Difference Between Psychogenic Fever and Regular Fevers?</h2><p>Liz Hughes, MEd, LPCC, founder and therapist of Mind Body Therapy shared key differences that distinguish a psychogenic fever as it relates to causes and symptoms.</p><p>Psychogenic fever is typically caused by emotional distress whereas more commonly fever is associated with an infection or other physical health condition. In addition, symptoms of a psychogenic fever generally do not occur with other typical symptoms of fever such as muscle aches, sweating and chills.</p><p>Dr. Julia Kogan, PsyD, a health psychologist with a background in neuropsychology and a specialty in chronic stress, sleep, and health behaviors explains that the key factor that distinguish a psychogenic fever is the absence of an infection or other organic or inflammatory cause of the elevated body temperature.</p><p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Fever usually is related to an inflammatory process in the body regulated by the immune system. This can be related to a viral or bacterial infection, certain medications, vaccines, specific inflammatory conditions, and other medical issues.</p><p>A psychogenic fever is one in which the general core body temperature is also higher than expected but there is no associated infection, virus, or illness to explain it and is thought to be related to stress.</p><p>“The main differentiator will be the presence of an inflammatory process in the body that is causing the fever. If testing has ruled out any condition, infection, medication or other common fever source, then it is more likely associated with a psychogenic fever,” explained Dr. Kogan.</p><p>Lastly, Dr. Kogan shared that common anti-inflammatory drugs will generally help to reduce most fevers. However, research has shown that these medications generally do not help to reduce psychogenic fevers, while psychotropic medications, therapy, and other forms of stress reduction can.</p><h2>How Does Stress Cause a Fever?</h2><p>Dr. Kogan explained that it isn’t fully understood how stress leads to psychogenic fever. More research is still needed on this topic in humans; however, animal studies suggest that in some individuals the stress response induces the sympathetic nervous system to activate brown adipose tissue. One of the functions of brown adipose tissue (a type of body fat) is to maintain our temperature in cold environments.</p><p>Psychological factors such as anxiety, fear, or emotional distress may contribute to the development of psychogenic fever</p><p>Miller says that mechanisms underlying psychogenic fever involve intricate interactions between the brain and the body.</p><p>“When under significant psychological stress, the brain activates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can then influence the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature, leading to a rise in temperature characteristic of psychogenic fever,” explains Miller.</p><h2>How Do You Get Rid of Psychogenic Fever?</h2><p>It’s difficult to know how long a psychogenic fever will last. Some people will experience a high fever of up to 105.8°F (41°C) after a stressful event. Others who experience chronic stress may develop a persistent low-grade fever between 98.6°F and 100.4°F (37–38°C) that can last months or even years.</p><h3>Address Underlying Factors</h3><p>The best way to get rid of a psychogenic fever is to address the underlying cause. </p><p>A 2015 study discussed the case of a 15-year-old female who developed a high psychogenic fever of up to 105.8°F (41°C) only on school days. Upon returning home, her fever would disappear. She had no signs of inflammation. During an interview, the student revealed she was having a difficult time at school due to classmates who were bullying her friend. After she changed schools, her psychogenic fever went away.</p><h3>Adopt Coping Strategies and Self-Care Practices</h3><p>Miller shared it’s essential to address underlying psychological stressors and practice self-compassion. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises, can help you tune into your body and calm the nervous system.</p><p>“You can train yourself to tune into your symptoms with a sense of calm, rather than fear or distress. For instance, reminding yourself that the fever isn’t dangerous, and you can relax, which reduces the stress around the symptoms themselves,” advised Miller.</p><p>Our mind and body are intimately connected. Treating our minds well can create a positive impact on our bodies and vice versa. Dr. Kogan emphasized that a holistic and well-rounded approach to managing acute and chronic stress is not only important for reducing psychogenic fever in those susceptible to it, but also mitigating other negative impacts of stress on the body.</p><p>According to Dr. Kogen, a holistic approach includes practicing deep relaxation, addressing any unhelpful and anxious thoughts that contribute to high stress, and addressing lifestyle factors contributing to high stress, including quality sleep, balanced eating, exercising, and having stress outlets.</p><p>It’s important for individuals experiencing recurrent or persistent unexplained fevers to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and management.</p><p>“If you are experiencing any type of fever, I would first recommend visiting your primary care doctor to rule out organic causes of the fever. Your doctor can support you in deciding which resources would be best once an organic cause is ruled out, such as relaxation techniques, CBT therapy, and stress management techniques,” advises Hughes.</p></main></body>
