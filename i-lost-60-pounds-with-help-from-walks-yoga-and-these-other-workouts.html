It is easy to make excuses, to get too busy, or not to have the energy to keep up with it," she tells Body Network. One of her main tools? She keeps her goals "small and achievable" and doesn't beat herself up if she misses a workout.</p><figure><img title="1 Keep Your Goals Small" src="IMG/BB1oJhWc_1_keep_your_goals_small.jpg" alt="1 Keep Your Goals Small"><figcaption><em>1 Keep Your Goals Small. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Get Out of Your Comfort Zone</h2><p>"Find a way to implement workouts with friends, try new activities that involve movement, get out of your comfort zone, and make it an activity that's enjoyable instead of something to check off your list," she says. Here are some of the workouts that helped her achieve her weight loss goals.</p><h2>3 Shawndra Has a "Hybrid Workout Routine"</h2><p>Shawndra doesn't rely on a single workout to keep her mentally and physically fit. "I have come to love a hybrid exercise routine! I think that variety in your fitness is key to success," she tells us.</p><figure><img title="3 Shawndra Has a " hybrid="" workout="" routine""="" src="IMG/BB1oJhWg_3_shawndra_has_a_hybrid_workout_routine.jpg" alt="3 Shawndra Has a " hybrid="" workout="" routine""=""><figcaption><em>3 Shawndra Has a "Hybrid Workout Routine". © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 She Does Strength and Weight Training Three Times a Week</h2><p>"Outside of my daily routine, I have found tremendous benefit from implementing a weight lifting routine three times a week," she says. "This helps keep up my overall strength and has supported my day-to-day functionality overall."</p><h2>5 Shawndra Starts with Shoulder Presses</h2><p>Her exercises included shoulder presses to "build overall shoulder size and development," side lateral raises to make her waistline smaller, body weight squats, and "effective" move that "can be done anywhere and work the entire body and so many variations," and planks, which also "can be done anywhere, target the entire body, strengthens the core" and can be done in "so many variations."</p><figure><img title="5 Shawndra Starts with Shoulder Presses" src="IMG/BB1oJruo_5_shawndra_starts_with_shoulder_presses.jpg" alt="5 Shawndra Starts with Shoulder Presses"><figcaption><em>5 Shawndra Starts with Shoulder Presses. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6 She Also Does Yoga</h2><p>She also takes a hot or power yoga class "to jumpstart my day, regulate my mood, set my mind up, and increase my overall heart health," says Shawndra.</p><h2>7 Walking Is Critical for Her</h2><p>Shawndra also gets her steps in. "It is a critical component for me to get outside and walk my dog a couple miles at lunch daily. This helps break the day, allows time for fresh air and sunshine, and is a mood boost mid-day," she says.</p><h2>8 She Never Forgets to Stretch</h2><p>Shawndra makes sure to stretch. "To counter the energy, I implement a deep stretch routine (oftentimes with red-light therapy) to slow down, recenter myself, and release any mental and physical stress I've accumulated throughout the day," she says.</p><h2>9 She "Loves" to Add New Ideas</h2><p>In addition to these exercises, Shawndra "loves" implementing a new fitness activity two to three per month, "hiking, paddle boarding, rock climbing, you name it, I'm there," she says. "As an adventure seeker myself, I find so much joy in learning new things and pushing my limits. Exercise is a gift! I've cultivated a life around fitness, mobility, and movement. Keep it fun!"</p><h2>10 Here Is What She Doesn't Eat</h2><p>Shawndra avoids "processed foods of any kind & sugar," seed oils, and caffeine. "I tend to stay away from any meat that is not locally sourced if I can," she adds. "I have not completely eliminated any food, although I closely monitor my dairy intake. I work to eliminate processed sugar and sodium, so I try to prepare all of my meals or, when eating out, make selections from the salad menu."</p><h2>11 Her Number 1 Tip: Start a Journal</h2><p>Shawndra's number one tip? "Start a food journal of everything you eat and why," she says. "It will tell the complete story and help identify behaviors and patterns that can't be denied and should be eliminated as well as any emotional ties that should be addressed."
