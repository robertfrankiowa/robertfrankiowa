    <main><h1>10 of America's most affordable retirement spots, where the weather is good and healthcare is top-notch</h1><ul class="summary-list"><li>Realtor.com ranked top retirement spots based on home prices and amenities for older residents.</li><li>Florida is a popular retirement destination, but California and New Jersey had a few in the top 10.</li><li>Many seniors face financial constraints and depend on Social Security for retirement.</li></ul><p>Many Americans preparing to retire are wondering just how far their finances can take them.</p><p>After all, most older adults live on meager incomes, and many are reliant on ever-imperiled Social Security. But for the workers who have put in their time, a cheaper spot to throw in the towel may be one solution for their economic woes. And, of course, many older people are also dealing with a rising sense of loneliness — making a strong community even more key to a comfortable retirement.</p><p>Some states have more retirees than others; perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly a fifth of Florida is retired.</p><p>Indeed, Florida hosts some of the best spots to retire, at least according to a new ranking from the real-estate website Realtor.com. Realtor.com ranked the top 10 places to retire, looking at a combination of housing prices, median ages, and real-estate listings that point to a retiree-friendly area.</p><p>While Florida is showing up and showing out, you don't necessarily have to head south to find an ideal post-career destination — your affordable retirement might just be down the Jersey Shore.</p><p>Here are Realtor.com's top 10 spots to retire, what it costs to live in each place, and what the places are best known for.</p><figure><img title="10 of America's most affordable retirement spots, where the weather is good and healthcare is top-notch" src="IMG/BB1nuebk_10_of_americas_most_affordable_retirement_spots_where_the_weather_is_good_and_healthcare_is_top_notch.jpg" alt="10 of America's most affordable retirement spots, where the weather is good and healthcare is top-notch"><figcaption><em>10 of America's most affordable retirement spots, where the weather is good and healthcare is top-notch.

There are plenty of golf courses as well as indoor and outdoor pools. During waking hours, it's legal to drive golf carts on the streets.</p><p><em>Correction: June 3, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misidentified which Orange County city was identified by Realtor.com as having cheaper retirement-friendly listings than elsewhere in the county. It was Laguna Woods, not Laguna Beach. Citing information provided by Realtor.com, the story also misidentified the location of Menifee's Sun City neighborhood. It is not on the periphery of Joshua Tree National Park. The Sun City Palm Desert facility, which is near the park, is not in Menifee; a reference to the facility was removed from the story.</em></p></main>
