    <main><h1>The 10 Best and Worst Foods for Your Kidneys, According to Dietitians</h1><p>Learn what to eat more of and what to limit to support healthy kidneys.</p><strong>Reviewed by Dietitian Emily Lachtrupp, M.S., RD</strong><p>If you’re a typically healthy person, your kidneys do a good job of filtering waste and toxins out of your body. (And that’s without the need for cleanses or detoxes.) Your kidneys work hard every day balancing fluid, minerals and salts in your body.</p><p>They play a pretty important role in your body, filtering a half-cup of blood every minute, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Each kidney contains about a million nephrons, special filters that help remove waste from your blood. Any nutrients your body still needs are routed back into your blood, and the waste and excess fluid are separated out to make urine.</p><figure><img title="Provided by EatingWell" src="IMG/AA1iBQDL_serving_bowl_of_autumn_salad_with_utensils_on_a_rust_colored_linen_surrounded_by_glasses_of_sparkling_wat.jpg" alt="Serving bowl of autumn salad with utensils on a rust colored linen, surrounded by glasses of sparkling water."><figcaption><em>Jen Causey (Photographer), Rishon Hanners (Food Stylist), Julia Bayless (Prop Stylist).

Their job doesn’t stop there: the kidneys also make hormones that are needed for the production of new red blood cells and healthy bones. </p><p>Diabetes and high blood pressure are the top two causes of kidney disease, according to the National Kidney Foundation. That means that 1 in 3 U.S. adults would benefit from paying a little extra attention to these two bean-shaped organs. And maintaining a kidney-friendly diet can help you do just that.</p><p>Even if you’re not living with kidney disease, it’s always a good idea to include healthy foods in your diet that can help your kidneys do their job. “We know how vital nutrition is for kidney health. Thankfully, we don’t need to rely on bizarre detox drinks or unappetizing concoctions to support our kidneys. There are plenty of beneficial foods for anyone keen on kidney care,” says Catalina Ruz, a Philadelphia-based registered dietitian nutritionist with Top Nutrition Coaching.</p><p>Here are five foods to include—and five to avoid—to give your hardworking kidneys a little bit of love.</p><h2>Best Foods for Your Kidneys</h2><h3>1. Dark Leafy Greens</h3><p>Dark leafy greens are “a powerhouse of antioxidants, vitamins C, E and K, and minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium and iron, making them excellent for preventing kidney disease,” Ruz says. “These vegetables combat inflammation and protect against oxidative damage that occurs when the kidneys are overworked,” she adds. Ready for an antioxidant boost? Try our Greens with Crispy Onions.</p><h3>2. Tart Cherries</h3><p>The kidneys have tiny, delicate arteries and veins that can become damaged when blood pressure is too high for too long. Foods that support healthy blood pressure also support healthy kidneys, and tart cherries are one of those foods. “Rich in vitamin A and antioxidants, tart cherries have been associated with reduced blood pressure, making them an excellent choice for a kidney-supportive diet. Good blood pressure management is crucial for preventing kidney damage,” Ruz says.</p><h3>3. Tofu</h3><p>If you’re looking for plant-based protein to improve your kidney health, grab some tofu. Meat, which has plenty of nutritional benefits, can be a little higher in acid, which can put a strain on kidneys that are struggling. “Since the kidneys balance our body’s pH and remove acids, foods that support this process, like tofu, can be incredibly kidney-supportive,” Ruz explains. “Unlike animal-based protein, plant proteins help improve the body’s pH, avoiding a [potentially harmful] acidic environment in the body,” she says.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you need to give up meat. But if you’re looking to cut down a little on your meat intake, tofu can fit the bill. Give this easy Tofu and Broccoli Stir-Fry a try.</p><h3>4. Flaxseed</h3><p>High blood sugar levels, over time, can cause kidney damage. That’s why type 2 diabetes is linked to chronic kidney disease. One way to keep your glucose stable, and therefore your kidneys healthy, is by including high-fiber foods, like flaxseed, in your diet. “This fiber helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, which is crucial for kidney health,” Ruz says.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most Americans only get about half of the fiber needed daily. Two tablespoons of ground flaxseed contain nearly 4 grams of fiber, according to the USDA. Sprinkle some into your smoothie or try our Blueberry-Oat Scones with Flaxseeds.</p><h3>5. Garlic</h3><p>This allium is famous for its wellness benefits, and now we can add kidney health to the list. “Garlic serves as a potent anti-inflammatory agent and has been shown to help reduce blood pressure, both of which are beneficial for kidney function,” Ruz says. “Additionally, garlic helps counteract oxidative damage that can be caused by kidney disease, thus supporting the prevention of further kidney damage,” she adds. Check out our collection of dozens of Healthy Garlic Recipes.</p><h2>Worst Foods for Your Kidneys</h2><h3>1. Dark Sodas</h3><p>Sodas, especially dark sodas like colas, are high in artificial phosphorus. Phosphorus is a mineral that is necessary for strong bones, and healthy kidneys can easily filter out excess phosphorus from food. But Ruz cautions against the artificial phosphorus found in dark sodas, saying it can be hard on the kidneys. In addition, she says, “Dietitians often advise against consuming dark sodas, as they are also a significant source of added sugars. For maintaining kidney health, it’s wise to skip them.”</p><h3>2. Frozen Dinners</h3><p>Frozen dinners are often ultra-processed, and while they’re easy and convenient, they are often off the charts in sodium. “It's not uncommon for these meals to contain over 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. Since managing salt intake is crucial for kidney health, we generally advise against relying on most frozen dinners,” Ruz says. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that most individuals stick to a limit of 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Those who have kidney disease or high blood pressure should cap sodium intake at 1,500 mg per day.</p><h3>3. Fast Food</h3><p>Fast foods are often high in saturated fat, sugar and calories—and low in nutrition. “A kidney-friendly diet should primarily consist of a variety of fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates and lean proteins. Fast food, being rich in sodium, saturated fats and phosphorus, lacks the beneficial nutrients needed for kidney health,” Ruz says. “Despite its convenience, it’s advisable to limit fast-food consumption,” she adds.</p><p>Not all cheeses are created equal. If you look closely at product labels on certain processed cheeses, you’ll find that they’re not just plain cheese–or not even real cheese at all. These are often labeled as “cheese product.” “Even small portions of these cheeses can introduce significant amounts of sodium and unnecessary phosphorus to your body, which is not ideal for maintaining healthy kidneys,” says Ruz. Skip these in favor of natural cheeses, such as Swiss or Cheddar.</p><p>Protein is vital for cellular growth and repair. But it’s possible to get too much. “Excessive consumption of animal protein can be strenuous on the kidneys. Animal proteins produce a high level of acid in the blood, which the kidneys must work to eliminate. Moderating meat intake is a considerate approach to maintaining kidney health,” Ruz says.</p><p>Again, this doesn’t mean you can’t eat meat, as healthy kidneys easily filter out the acid. Meat offers plenty of health benefits, but if you’re concerned about your kidneys, talk to your doctor about how much meat you should be eating.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>There is no single food that’s best for your kidneys, and there’s no single food that can cause serious harm to your kidneys. Aim for a balanced diet that keeps your blood sugar and blood pressure in check, which will support kidney health. Keeping in mind certain potentially supportive foods, like tofu, tart cherries and dark leafy greens, and focusing on a healthy lifestyle can go a long way toward keeping your kidneys running well for years to come.</p></main>
