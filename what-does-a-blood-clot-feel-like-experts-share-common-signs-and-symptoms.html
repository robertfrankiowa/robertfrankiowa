    <main><h1>What Does a Blood Clot Feel Like? Experts Share Common Signs and Symptoms</h1><h2>Swelling in One Limb</h2><p>A common sign of DVT is swelling in an leg or arm. <em>“Blood clots can block the healthy flow of blood in the legs, and blood can pool behind the clot causing swelling,”</em> explains Dr. Navarro. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms of a blood clot in the leg include swelling, redness, and tenderness. If you notice sudden swelling, especially with pain, it’s important to consult a doctor.</p><figure><img title="Swelling in One Limb" src="IMG/BB1nOlnY_swelling_in_one_limb.jpg" alt="Swelling in One Limb"><figcaption><em>Swelling in One Limb.

This pain is often mistaken for a muscle cramp or strain. “Pain from a blood clot can easily be mistaken for a muscle cramp or strain, which is why the issue often goes undiagnosed and is specifically dangerous,” Dr. Navarro says. DVT pain typically worsens when walking or flexing the foot. This pain might remind you of a nasty muscle cramp or a charley horse.</p><figure><img title="Pain in the Leg or Arm" src="IMG/BB1nOeiD_pain_in_the_leg_or_arm.jpg" alt="Pain in the Leg or Arm"><figcaption><em>Pain in the Leg or Arm.

While bruises are visible types of blood clots, DVTs are not. You might see some discoloration, but redness is more common. This symptom, paired with warmth in the affected area, is a signal that you need medical attention. Your leg may also feel warm as the clot worsens, and you may notice a slight reddish or bluish hue to your skin.

PE pain is usually sharp and worsens with deep breaths. Accompanying symptoms like sudden shortness of breath and a rapid heart rate require immediate medical intervention. “<em>A blood clot in the chest area can feel like a heart attack, or can feel like a sharp and stabbing pain that gets worse with deep breaths,</em>” says Dr. Navarro.</p><h2>Unexplained Cough</h2><p>A persistent, unexplained cough, especially if accompanied by shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, or chest pain, could be a sign of PE. “<em>The cough will be dry, but sometimes people can cough up mucus and/or blood,”</em> notes Dr. Navarro. At that point, if you aren't already headed to the emergency room, you should be. According to Dr. Thomas Maldonado, a vascular surgeon at NYU Langone Medical Center, chest pain that feels worse with each breath and a sudden rapid heart rate are common indicators of a PE.</p><h2>Racing Heart and Feeling Faint</h2><p>When a blood clot hits your lungs, your heart rate may increase to compensate for the reduced oxygen levels. <strong>“Feeling a flutter in your chest and having trouble with deep breaths could be your body sending out an SOS that you've got a PE lurking in your lungs,</strong>” says Dr. George P. Teitelbaum. Additionally, lightheadedness or fainting may occur due to changes in blood flow and oxygenation. Dr. Lewis Nelson from Rutgers New Jersey Medical School adds, “<em>The lightheadedness is due in part to the chemical released from the lungs, changes in oxygenation of the blood, and in the blood pressure and heart rate”.</em></p><figure><img title="Racing Heart and Feeling Faint" src="IMG/BB1nOwBF_racing_heart_and_feeling_faint.jpg" alt="Racing Heart and Feeling Faint"><figcaption><em>Racing Heart and Feeling Faint.

If you experience any of these symptoms, especially in combination, seek medical attention immediately. Blood clots are serious and can lead to fatal conditions if left untreated.</p></main>
