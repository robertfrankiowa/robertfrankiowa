    <main><h1>Prednisone Dosage Chart for Dogs: Risks, Side Effects, Dosage, and More</h1><p>Has your canine companion just been prescribed a medication called prednisone? We know you likely have questions, so we’re here to tell you all there is to know about prednisone use in dogs. </p><p>In this article we will discuss the details of prednisone, common side effects, dosing, and more! Let’s get started. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Prednisone?</h2><figure><img title="©Jus_Ol/Shutterstock.com" src="IMG/BB1pw3hi_dog_being_offered_pill.jpg" alt="dog being offered pill"><figcaption><em>Prednisone is a glucocorticoid medication that suppresses the immune system and decreases inflammation. ©Jus_Ol/Shutterstock.com. ©Jus_Ol/Shutterstock.com</em></figcaption></figure><p>Prednisone is a <strong>glucocorticoid medication</strong> that is commonly used in both humans and animals. It is designed to suppress the immune system’s response to a variety of diseases and conditions, and target the inflammation these issues cause.</p><p>Your veterinarian may also prescribe a medication called prednisolone, and while they are classified as different medications, they are often used interchangeably in dogs. Whether your dog is prescribed <strong>prednisone or prednisolone</strong>, they will work in the same way to suppress the immune system and decrease inflammation. </p><p><em>Keep in mind that while dogs are often prescribed prednisone and prednisolone interchangeably, this is not the case for cats. Cats tend to process prednisolone much easier.</em></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Prednisone Safe For Use In Dogs?</h2><p><strong>Prednisone is safe for use in dogs when following the guidance of your veterinarian.</strong> Dog owners must follow specific instructions when giving their dog prednisone, as it can be dangerous when given outside of veterinary advisement. Steroids can also exacerbate underlying medical conditions, so your vet will need to make sure your little one is healthy before they start taking prednisone. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Most Common Uses Of Prednisone In Dogs</h2><p>Prednisone is used to tackle a variety of medical conditions in dogs, so let’s list a few of its most common uses below. </p><p>Prednisone is often prescribed to dogs for the following issues:</p><ul> <li>Allergic reactions</li>    <li>Anaphylactic reactions</li>    <li>Inflammation found with intervertebral disc disease</li>    <li>Autoimmune conditions</li>    <li>Addison’s disease</li>    <li>Some eye conditions</li>    <li>Some cancers</li> </ul><p>Prednisone is often used alongside other medications, so your dog will typically be prescribed other treatment options as well. Prednisone can be used in a variety of conditions that lead to an inflammatory response, so your vet may prescribe prednisone for other conditions that are not listed. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Is Prednisone Given In Dogs?</h2><p>Prednisone is most commonly found in pill form, but you can have it compounded into a flavored liquid if your dog struggles to take pills. It should always be given by mouth with food, and if you are instructed to give it once daily, then you <strong>should always try to give it in the morning.</strong> </p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that you should never stop prednisone abruptly if your dog is taking it long-term. If you do ever need to stop this medication, you vet will offer you guidance on how to safely taper them off the drug. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are There Side Effects Of Prednisone For Dogs?</h2><p>Prednisone is safe for dogs when following the guidance of your veterinarian, but there are a few side effects that are often seen with steroid use. These potential side effects include:</p><ul> <li>Increased thirst</li>    <li>Increased urination</li>    <li>Increased hunger</li> </ul><p>Some of the side effects that are more common with long-term prednisone use in dogs include:</p><ul> <li>Lethargy</li>    <li>Panting</li>    <li>Diarrhea</li>    <li>Vomiting</li>    <li>Changes in haircoat texture</li>    <li>Weight gain</li>    <li>Personality changes</li> </ul><p>While side effects like increased thirst, increased urination, and increased hunger are often unavoidable with prednisone, we do suggest reaching out to your vet if your dog is experiencing any of the other side effects we listed. Your vet may be able to manage their side effects. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is The Prednisone Dose For Dogs?</h2><figure><img title="©New Africa/Shutterstock.com" src="IMG/BB1pvYBZ_dog_receiving_a_flavored_pill.jpg" alt="Dog receiving a flavored pill"><figcaption><em>Prednisone for dogs should be given by mouth and with food. ©New Africa/Shutterstock.com. ©New Africa/Shutterstock.com</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Before we discuss the prednisone dose for dogs, we should state again that you should never give your dog prednisone without veterinary approval.</strong></p><p>Prednisone is often given in loading dose form when it is first prescribed. This means that your dog gets a higher dose during the first few days of taking the medication, only to taper down the dose in the days to follow. </p><p>Loading dose aside, let’s discuss the average dose of prednisone in dogs. Most vets will prescribe 2.5mg per 10 pounds of body weight, so let’s list a few examples of that. </p><ul> <li>5 – 20 pounds – 1.25 to 5 mg</li>    <li>20 – 40 pounds- 5 to 10 mg</li>    <li>40 – 80 pounds – 10 to 20 mg</li>    <li>80 – 160 pounds – 20 to 40 mg</li> </ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prednisone Risks In Dogs To Be Aware Of</h2><p>Prednisone can cause health complications for dogs with underlying medical conditions. Prednisone may not be safe for dogs with kidney disease, liver disease, cardiac disease, diabetes, or cataracts. This is why it is so important to have your pet assessed by a vet before giving them prednisone, as many of these health conditions are impossible to detect without testing. You never want to take the risk of sending your little one into a health crisis. </p><p>In addition to the risk of exacerbating underlying health issues with prednisone use, there are dangerous drug interactions that you should be aware of. You should not give your dog prednisone if they are taking the following medications:</p><ul> <li>Antifungal medications</li>    <li>Anti-inflammatory medications</li>    <li>NSAIDS</li>    <li>Diuretics</li>    <li>Immunosupressants</li>    <li>Seizure medications</li>    <li>Some antibiotics</li> </ul><p>Your veterinarian may be able to offer guidance on how to give prednisone alongside the above medications safely, so always speak with your vet about any medications your dog is currently taking.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2><p>Prednisone is a steroid that is commonly prescribed for use in dogs. Be sure to review the information we discussed above on safe administration of prednisone in dogs, and you will have a better understanding of how this medication works in your canine friend. </p><p>Sharks, lions, alligators, and more!
