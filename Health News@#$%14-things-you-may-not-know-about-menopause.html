    <main><h1>14 Things You May Not Know About Menopause</h1><p>While many women are taught to fear this life phase, the truth is that menopause doesn’t have to be terrible. This natural process happens to all of us, so learning what we will face is crucial to be prepared for what’s to come.</p><p>This delicate phase of a woman’s life can have plenty of repercussions on your mental and physical health, but there is no reason to fear. Here are 14 things you may not know about menopause that will help you navigate this period. </p><figure><img title="14 Things You May Not Know About Menopause" src="IMG/BB1pmJgs_14_things_you_may_not_know_about_menopause.jpg" alt="14 Things You May Not Know About Menopause"><figcaption><em>14 Things You May Not Know About Menopause.

There are some common symptoms that you may share, but a lot of it will depend on a woman’s overall health, lifestyle, and genetics. Some women may get off lightly and have symptoms that are easily managed, whereas others may be put through the wringer.</p><h2>Duration Of Symptoms Will Vary</h2><p>Not only do some women’s symptoms look a bit different from one another, but the amount of time they last isn’t set in stone either. The duration of symptoms will again vary depending on your health, lifestyle, and genetics. Just remember that it’s temporary.</p><figure><img title="Duration Of Symptoms Will Vary" src="IMG/BB1nyjhf_duration_of_symptoms_will_vary.jpg" alt="Duration Of Symptoms Will Vary"><figcaption><em>Duration Of Symptoms Will Vary.

This is due to a change in hormones and a dip in estrogen which can both contribute to a shift in your metabolism. Weight gain doesn’t necessarily happen to every woman, however, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, a balanced diet, and regular exercise, should help to keep the weight off if you are concerned.</p><h2>The Difference Between Perimenopause And Menopause</h2><p>Perimenopause is when you have all the symptoms that come with menopause, however, your periods still haven’t stopped. Going an entire 12 months without having a period officially marks the beginning of your menopause. </p><h2>The Effect On Bone Health</h2><p>Menopause significantly speeds up bone loss, and the risk of osteoporosis increases. This is because your estrogen, which is the hormone responsible for maintaining strength in your bones, decreases. Because of this, you are much more susceptible to fractures and bone breakages after your menopause. </p><h2>Menopause After A Hysterectomy</h2><p>If you have your ovaries removed as part of a hysterectomy, then menopause will start immediately after. This is known as a surgical menopause. If you have a hysterectomy but your ovaries are not removed, then you shouldn’t expect menopause to begin right away. </p><h2>Hormone Replacements</h2><p>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) will help to treat symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes or vaginal dryness. HRT will replace the hormones that your body is no longer making enough of due to your body going through menopause. Speak to a medical professional to find out more about HRT.</p><h2>Non-Hormonal Options For Managing Symptoms</h2><p>If you’re suffering from menopause symptoms, then there are non-hormonal options that can help to relieve them. There are lubricants available to help with vaginal dryness, and adding soy to your diet is also thought to alleviate hot flashes. </p><h2>Hot Flashes</h2><p>Hot flashes are one of the most common symptoms of both perimenopause and menopause. During these hot flashes, you will experience a feeling of intense heat in your chest, neck, and face, and perhaps feel a chill afterward. It’s been said that people who smoke may have more hot flashes than those who don’t. Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight can also help to reduce these “tropical moments” as my mother calls them.</p><figure><img title="Hot Flashes" src="IMG/BB1nz6hk_hot_flashes.jpg" alt="Hot Flashes"><figcaption><em>Hot Flashes.

The loss of estrogen and testosterone will have an impact on a woman’s body, and they might find that they are less interested in sex. </p><h2>Pregnancy May Still Be Possible</h2><p>While it may not be common to get pregnant when you’re going through menopause, it’s not entirely impossible, especially if you are currently in your perimenopause and are still ‘young enough’ to get pregnant. Take precautions and speak to your doctor if you have any concerns about getting pregnant. </p><figure><img title="Pregnancy May Still Be Possible" src="IMG/BB1nz8Ov_pregnancy_may_still_be_possible.jpg" alt="Pregnancy May Still Be Possible"><figcaption><em>Pregnancy May Still Be Possible.

For instance, bad habits such as smoking can affect your ovary health, leading you to enter menopause early on. On the other hand, some women may start this phase in their late 50s.</p><h2>Depression</h2><p>Unfortunately, women tend to be more prone to depression during this delicate phase. Of course, this won’t happen to all women entering menopause; however, if you already have a pass dealing with this mental condition, you may want to be extra careful when your menopause starts. </p><h2>Coping Mechanisms</h2><p>But what are some good mechanisms to deal with menopause? Regular exercise can be a great ally. Maintaining a healthy diet is also crucial for your mental and physical well-being. Try to determine whether some types of food negatively affect your health and keep them out of your diet for some time.</p></main>
