    <main><h1>Walnut Nutrition: 11 Health Benefits of Walnuts</h1><h2>Support a Healthy Heart</h2><p>Another important fact I learned from the walnut experts at the ranch was that walnuts are rich in healthy fats that can actually improve your heart health. According to California Walnuts, "Since 1993, published research has been investigating how eating walnuts affects various heart health markers such as LDL (“bad”) and HDL (“good”) cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammation, and plaque formation."</p><p>A telling study in the <em>British Journal of Nutrition</em> found that people who regularly ate nuts like walnuts had a 37% lower risk for heart disease than those who didn't. Who knew walnuts were such a powerhouse nut?!</p><p>Get all your healthy fats in one delicious bite when you make this crispy walnut-crusted salmon!</p><figure><img title="Support a Healthy Heart" src="IMG/AA1llc59_support_a_healthy_heart.jpg" alt="Support a Healthy Heart"><figcaption><em>Support a Healthy Heart.

Walnuts are rich in vitamins like copper, manganese and magnesium; these nutrients are essential to maintaining bone density and preventing osteoporosis.</p><p>Magnesium also helps your body absorb calcium, so try tossing some chopped walnuts over your morning parfait or sprinkle over a spring salad. During my time at the ranch, we had a wonderful butternut squash walnut soup, perfect for a chilly day. I also enjoyed a tasty walnut cream ravioli dish that was divine! Check out even more walnut recipes from California Walnuts.</p><h2>Say Goodbye to Gallstones</h2><p>A 2004 study found that women who regularly eat walnuts and other nuts are at lower risk for gallbladder disease and at a significantly lower risk of needing to have their gallbladders removed. To start incorporating more nuts into your diet, swap your lunchtime turkey sandwich for this sweet and crunchy apple walnut salad.</p><p>During my time in California, I learned just how easy it was to incorporate more walnuts into your every day diet. For example, if you love yogurt and fruit for breakfast, add a few walnuts to add a sweet crunch. If you like to have stir fry entrees for the evening, toast some walnuts and toss them in. Walnuts are extremely versatile and can be added to sweet or salty dishes!</p><figure><img title="Say Goodbye to Gallstones" src="IMG/AA1lleRf_say_goodbye_to_gallstones.jpg" alt="Say Goodbye to Gallstones"><figcaption><em>Say Goodbye to Gallstones.

In fact, walnuts are <em>loaded</em> with healthy fats, protein and fiber to keep you full and satisfied. This might be why they're associated with maintaining a healthy weight.</p><p>A study in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> found that women who rarely ate nuts like walnuts had a higher risk of weight gain than the nut lovers. Try sprinkling some over your healthy side dishes, like roasted green beans with lemon and walnuts.</p><figure><img title="Manage Weight" src="IMG/AA1lllIb_manage_weight.jpg" alt="Manage Weight"><figcaption><em>Manage Weight. suti/Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Give Skin a Healthy Glow</h2><p>Yes, really, walnuts can help your skin too. The healthy fats found in walnuts won't just protect your heart and blood vessels; they'll plump up your skin, too. Omega-3 fatty acids help skin cells retain moisture, giving your skin a smooth glow. Walnuts can also help fight inflammation, which means less redness and irritation. They may even help protect your skin against the sun's UV rays.</p><p>If you want more ideas on how to incorporate more walnuts into your diet, the experts I spoke to at California Walnuts explained to the group that it's way easier than you would think. Need a snack? Have some trail mix with walnuts mixed in. Want an easy salad idea? Try a simple arugula salad topped with feta cheese, grilled chicken and a handful of walnuts.</p><h2>Prevent Cancer</h2><p>Yes, this powerhouse of a nut can help prevent cancer. According to the American Institute for Cancer Research, all nuts support a healthy diet, but walnuts are especially beneficial. The combination of nutrients in walnuts can lower inflammation and reduce oxidative stress that can lead to cancer in the body. Give your cells a boost of antioxidants by serving this vibrant berry beet salad with dinner or make a tasty butternut squash walnut soup, like I had at the ranch.</p><figure><img title="Prevent Cancer" src="IMG/AA1llj6m_prevent_cancer.jpg" alt="Prevent Cancer"><figcaption><em>Prevent Cancer. CasarsaGuru/Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Manage Diabetes Complications</h2><p>Another amazing benefit of incorporating more walnuts in your everyday diet is that it may help you manage diabetes.</p><p>According to researchers at the Cleveland Clinic, people with diabetes who regularly ate certain types of nuts (including walnuts) had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke than those who didn't. Cut carbs and up your nutrients at dinner by substituting this acorn squash with blueberry walnut filling for rice or bread.</p><h2>Improve Gut Health</h2><p>Because walnuts are rich in fiber, they play an important role in your gut health. A study in the <em>Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry</em> found that eating walnuts can increase the number of good bacteria in your gut, which may prevent chronic disease and strengthen the immune system.</p><p><em>Fun Fact:</em> At the ranch, I learned that in order to maintain the freshness of your walnuts, the best place to store them is actually in the freezer!</p><h2>Help Reproductive Health</h2><p>Another surprising discovery I found in my time at the walnut farm was how walnuts could help with infertility in men. Researchers from the UCLA School of Nursing discovered that when men eat about two handfuls of walnuts each day, they had a boost in fertility and sperm health.</p><p>Skip the romantic spaghetti and meatballs on date night, and enjoy a bowl of bow ties with walnut herb pesto instead.</p><h2>Boost Brainpower</h2><p>Lastly, I learned that walnuts can help energize you and even improve your brain health. If you don't have enough reasons to eat more walnuts, this should be one to remember.</p><p>Polyunsaturated fats in walnuts have been associated with improved brain health and function, as well as improving your mood. So next time you're studying or working on a report, pass on the chips and snack on crunchy rosemary walnuts for a focus-boosting treat.</p></main>
