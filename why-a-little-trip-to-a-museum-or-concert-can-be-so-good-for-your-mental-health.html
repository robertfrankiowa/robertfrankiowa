If it’s been a minute since you’ve done any of those things—maybe a few hobbies fell off your radar during the pandemic or you’ve found it hard to justify the time or cost lately—you might be surprised to learn that outings like this can help your mental health, so much so that health care providers can actually <em>prescribe</em> them in parts of the US. It’s known as “arts on prescription” and can involve getting free tickets to events or classes—and even transportation to get there—so you can reap the benefits of enjoying things created by humans (or make them yourself).</p><p>“There are studies that show that engaging with art lowers your cortisol level, and it reduces the stress hormones that are released into your body,” says Adrienne Hundley, head of service development and delivery at the Atlanta-based Art Pharmacy, a company that partners with managed care plans and other organizations to administer programs in Massachusetts, California, and elsewhere. “There are some real physiological effects that are happening when you are taking that step back, taking the time to breathe, and engaging in something that is bringing you joy and pleasure,” she tells SELF.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the health benefits of cultural activities and how you can get those for yourself—even if you don’t have a doc who can dash off a prescription for you.</p><h2>Engaging with art may help you deal with loneliness.</h2><p>People have been singing, dancing, and creating—and sharing said efforts with each other—since the dawn of time. “Humans evolved to make and share art for a reason,” says Tasha Golden, PhD, director of research for the International Arts + Mind Lab at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (and who wrote a field guide for arts on prescription programs). “If it didn’t serve us in some essential way, we would’ve stopped doing it millennia ago.”</p><p>While arts on prescription plans are still being studied, research suggests they can help relieve anxiety and depression and promote feelings of connection. Some programs—known as “green prescriptions”—are even looking at combining both arts <em>and</em> nature for a sort of one-two punch-up for your mental health. (Remember that botanical garden we mentioned?)</p><p>Dena Trujillo, the CEO of Crisis Text Line, knows the US is in the throes of a mental health crisis. More than a million people reach out to the service each year, and loneliness and isolation are some of the top factors motivating folks, with one in five people saying it was a problem, according to a 2023 analysis. In a study of 87,000 (anonymized) conversations with younger people, two of the community resources they most often cited that helped them feel better were “engagement in music, writing, visual, and performing arts” and “opportunities for social connection.” (Others were mental health services, exercise/sports, books, and outdoor spaces/nature.)</p><p>“We all need connection,” Trujillo tells SELF. “The arts and expression are things that can help people of any age, like outdoor spaces and physical exercise.”</p><h2>There’s usually something for everyone.</h2><p>Some people prefer to enjoy the arts solo—say by wandering in the museum alone—while others want to take part with a pal or connect with new people, says Golden, who notes that arts on prescription programs often provide tickets for friends or family members to go with you. “Sometimes loneliness can be a matter of not feeling like you’re part of a larger thing, and being able to participate in a larger thing—even if you don’t go and chat with somebody while you’re there—is part of what makes you feel like you’re connected and belong,” she says. For folks who are looking for more direct conversations or connections, an ongoing art class might be the best fit, she says.</p><p>This isn’t about forcing yourself to go to the opera when an aria only gives you a headache (or puts you to sleep). To get the most benefit from your experiences, it’s important to choose something that speaks to you personally, Golden says. (Although some arts on prescription programs have more options than others, she says.) That could be listening to a band, going to the theater, or playing an instrument.</p><p>“It’s kind of like how people say the best workout is the one that you’ll do,” she says. “Singing in a choir, joining a music class, taking some lessons—whatever it might be.”</p><p>Eugénie Fontugne, a student at Stanford Graduate School of Business, picked activities like dance performances and concerts from her university’s arts prescribing program. “It’s definitely a good tool to unplug and just to take your mind off your day-to-day, homework assignments, finding a job—all these types of things,” she tells SELF.</p><p>However, if you’re having a hard time finding the energy to do anything at all, it’s okay to start slow. “When people are depressed, quite often you don’t know what you want to do—nothing’s really very interesting,” Golden says. She recommends taking the tiniest of steps if that’s all you can do. “I can turn on some music and see what it feels like. I can stand up and move my body as if I'm dancing and see if I feel just a little bit better,” she says.</p><h2>You don’t have to spend a ton of money to reap the benefits.</h2><p>If you don’t have access to an arts on prescription program—there are only a handful across the country like the one at Stanford University and a program run by the Mass Cultural Council—there are other ways to get the health benefits that don’t require a ton of money.</p><p>“The program at Stanford is amazing, but a lot of other places are also trying to democratize art,” Fontugne says. “Most museums are free at least one day per month, so that also creates more willingness to go.”</p><p>You also don’t have to live in a big city to find ways to engage. “If you’re living in an urban area that has symphonies and operas and concert halls, that’s amazing,” Hundley says. “But in [other] areas, non-traditional art spaces, libraries, and community centers are great. Most communities around the country have something going on, even if they’re not in downtown San Francisco where [people] can walk into the modern art museum.”</p><p>If you can manage it, it’s best to participate in these types of activities regularly, Hundley says. “We really encourage at least monthly engagements, and more frequently, if you’ve got the time,” she says. “It can be an hour a month, but that habit helps build that emotional resilience.”</p><p>In some ways, it’s about finding a definition of health that’s less centered on how far you can run or how flexible you are (although those are nice too if you can do them!) and more about whether you have something in your life that gives you, as Golden puts it, “meaning and enjoyment and purpose and pleasure.” Well-being is not just “the absence of something that I <em>don’t</em> want to experience; life has to have something in it that I <em>do</em> want to experience,” she says. “This model is not a panacea—it doesn’t just magically provide that—but it’s a concrete step toward providing that in communities.”</p><p>Trujillo says that if you need more urgent mental health support, you can text either HOME or HELLO to 741741 to reach a volunteer counselor. After that, it makes sense to focus on a long-term feel-better strategy. “Reach out for help—first and foremost always,” she says. “And then we can talk about prevention. That’s where we think that the arts are so helpful.”</p></main>
