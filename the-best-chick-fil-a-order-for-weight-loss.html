Choose grilled over fried.</h3><p>Choosing grilled chicken over fried options is healthier because it reduces the amount of unhealthy fats and calories in your meal. Grilled chicken is cooked without the need for additional oils or fats, making it a leaner protein option.</p><p>By opting for grilled chicken sandwiches or nuggets, you can still enjoy the delicious taste of Chick-fil-A without the guilt.</p><h3>2. Skip the sauce.</h3><p>When it comes to sauces, it's important to choose wisely. Many sauces, while tasty, can be high in calories, sugars, and fats. Instead of slathering your sandwich or nuggets in sauce, use them sparingly or choose lighter options like mustard or buffalo sauce in moderation. This way, you can still add flavor to your meal without going overboard on unhealthy ingredients.</p><h3>3. Seek out veggies.</h3><p>Adding extra veggies to your sandwich or salad is a great way to boost the nutritional value of your meal. Vegetables are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which can help you feel full and satisfied.</p><p>Aim to make your meal as colorful as possible by adding a variety of veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, and onions. Not only will this add flavor and texture to your meal, but it will also help you meet your daily vegetable intake goals.</p><h3>4. Choose sides wisely.</h3><p>Instead of opting for traditional fries as a side, consider choosing a lighter option. Chick-fil-A offers side salads, fruit cups, and the Kale Crunch salad side, all healthier fries alternatives. These options are lower in calories and fats while still being delicious and satisfying.</p><p>By choosing a lighter side, you can balance out your meal and avoid consuming excess calories.</p><p>Lastly, it's important to be mindful of your portions when dining at Chick-fil-A. The portion sizes at fast-food restaurants can often be larger than necessary, leading to overeating.</p><p>Consider sharing a meal with a friend or family member or saving half of your meal for later. This way, you can enjoy your meal without overindulging and stay on track with your health goals.</p></main>
