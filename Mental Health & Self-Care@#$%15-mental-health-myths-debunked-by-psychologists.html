    <main><h1>15 Mental Health Myths Debunked by Psychologists</h1><p>The stigma surrounding mental health may prevent people from seeking help or guidance. Mass media plays a role in perpetuating harmful stigmas, diverting people from receiving needed help.</p><p>Thankfully, psychologists have debunked these myths with theory, research, and studies to prove mental health shouldn’t carry this stigma any longer. These are 15 popular myths debunked by psychologists.</p><figure><img title="15 Mental Health Myths Debunked by Psychologists" src="IMG/BB1kDgBS_15_mental_health_myths_debunked_by_psychologists.jpg" alt="15 Mental Health Myths Debunked by Psychologists"><figcaption><em>15 Mental Health Myths Debunked by Psychologists. Provided by Kinda Frugal</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1. A Mental Health Condition Is a Sign of Low Intelligence</h2><p>A mental health diagnosis does not mean low intelligence, or high intelligence, for that matter. Mental health affects every age, gender, socio-economic status, and intelligence level. A combination of genetics, environment, brain chemistry, social situations, traumas, and physical injuries all lead to mental health conditions. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in five adults experience a mental illness, and one in 25 American adults live with a mental illness.</p><h2>2. Successful People Don’t Get Depressed</h2><p>Depression affects even happy people. Putting on a positive face and showing up to work doesn’t mean a person isn’t depressed. NAMI reports about 16 million American adults live with Major Depressive disorder, but that only covers one part of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that around 280 million people experience depression. Smiling Depression is a phenomenon where affected individuals mask their sadness with smiles or don’t show their emotions as much. This may cover depressive symptoms. It’s a “fake it ’til you make it” formula.</p><h2>3. Children Don’t Experience Mental Health Issues</h2><p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) debunked this myth, stating that 15% of all children between the ages of 10 and 19 experience some form of mental illness. NAMI further clarifies this information, reporting that certain displays of frequent childish behavior could be signs of a mental disorder. For example, a child without a mental disorder might have trouble focusing and sitting still throughout their childhood. Yet, a child with ADHD could display heightened symptoms of struggling to stay still, growing irritated, fidgeting around, and interrupting conversations.</p><p>A recent study by the University of Southampton and Paris Nanterre University followed individuals diagnosed with ADHD from age four to age 33 to monitor their behavior and misdiagnoses. The study found that the youngest children who received diagnoses maintained their symptoms into adulthood. This finding debunks the belief that children with ADHD diagnoses are simply acting their age.</p><h2>4. Everyone Has a Little Ocd</h2><p>Psychiatry.org defines Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder as “a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions).” These obsessions and compulsions take up time and disrupt daily life, leading the affected to feel disturbed and upset with the disorder. They do not joke about needing to clean their room, wash their dishes in the right way, or do other tasks that spark obsessive behavior.</p><p>The International OCD Foundation explains that most people experience slight forms of obsessions and compulsions in their lifetime, but that doesn’t correlate to a diagnosable medical condition of OCD. If the obsessions and compulsions begin upsetting daily life, that might point to the disorder.</p><h2>5. All Mental Health Requires Medication</h2><p>Receiving a mental health diagnosis means one thing: a mental health diagnosis. Getting a diagnosis does not mean you need medication to treat the condition or that you have to do anything about the condition. Nonetheless, those who receive diagnoses have options. Therapy, support groups, acupuncture, forms of alternative medication, or standard medication all work to treat mental health conditions. A combination of medication and therapy is the most effective way to treat conditions, according to Mental Health America.</p><h2>6. Talking About Mental Health Makes It Worse</h2><p>Some people think talking about their mental health makes it worse. Talking about the condition might stir up nerves and agitate those affected, but it does not worsen the condition. The opposite is true. Talking about a condition usually helps the person deal with the reality of their condition and open up, inviting help and recovery. Learning that you are not alone and others deal with similar issues reduces the fear surrounding mental health discussions.</p><h2>7. Violence Is Mental Health Related</h2><p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) reports that only three to five percent of violent crimes relate to people affected by mental health issues. The study finds that those living with mental illnesses are actually ten times more likely to be a victim of a violent crime than individuals living without a mental health condition.</p><h2>8. Medication Changes Personality</h2><p>A common misconception surrounding medication is that antidepressants and antipsychotics change personalities. While this belief is not true, the myth leads many to avoid taking medication for fear of losing their personality. Medications like antidepressants and antipsychotics do not change personalities. They alleviate symptoms related to the depression or disorder. Experts say that those who take these medications experience diminished symptoms or personality shifts that are indicative of the medication relieving anxieties or depression, not changing their actual personalities.</p><h2>9. Parents Caused My Illness</h2><p>According to psychiatrist Dr. Cheryl Dodds, M.D., many parents fear their parenting techniques will lead to mental health diagnoses in their children. Due to this fear, the parents may tiptoe around mental health issues, worrying they are the blame or even the direct cause of their child’s diagnosis. Dodds says this misinformation does not translate into the psychological world because a combination of genetic, environmental, and biological makeup equates to diagnoses, not parenting techniques.</p><h2>10. LGBTQ+ Is a Mental Illness</h2><p>According to Psychology Today, from 1968 to 1973, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) claimed those who identified as LGBTQ+ had a mental illness. In 1973, however, the American Psychiatric Association agreed to remove the LGBTQ+ diagnosis from the manual. The classification of the diagnosis shifted from “homosexuality” to those conflicted with orientation. In 1987, the DSM eradicated all diagnoses of LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness. Today, therapists understand that being LGBTQ+ is not a mental illness.</p><h2>11. People With Mental Illnesses Can’t Have Jobs</h2><p>A harmful myth about mental illness says that individuals with mental illness or mental health conditions cannot hold steady jobs. This harmful rhetoric alienates those with a mental condition and perpetuates lies about individuals with mental illnesses or mental health conditions. In reality, many people with mental health conditions or mental illness diagnoses show up for work the same as coworkers without mental health conditions. SAMHSA reports that those with mental health conditions who can manage their symptoms can have jobs.</p><figure><img title="11.

Ocd Is a Personality Trait</h2><p>How often have you heard someone say, “I’m so OCD, I have to wipe down my counters before a guest comes over?” Or someone says, “You’re so OCD, how you clean?” Throwing around mental diagnoses like personality traits not only harms those with the condition but spreads misinformation that disorders are reduced to personality traits. Mental health disorders are not quirks tossed around to make conversation. They are valid conditions that disrupt daily life and well-being for millions of people.</p><h2>13. Depression Is Just Sadness</h2><p>Sadness is a fleeting feeling of pain or sorrow associated with an occurrence. Depression is a mental health illness where one feels a loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed and decreased functionality in life. Sadness may be a symptom of depression, but depression doesn’t retreat the way that sadness does. Depression affects individuals long-term and disrupts their lives.</p><figure><img title="13. Depression Is Just Sadness" src="IMG/BB1kDnYx_13_depression_is_just_sadness.jpg" alt="13. Depression Is Just Sadness"><figcaption><em>13. Depression Is Just Sadness.

Recovery Doesn’t Exist</h2><p>Merriam-Webster defines recovery as “the process of combating a disorder (such as alcoholism) or a real or perceived problem.” This wording applies to issues like substance abuse, trauma, and mental health conditions. With therapy, in some cases, medications, and lifestyle adjustments, people affected with mental health issues recover from their conditions. NAMI communicates their understanding of recovery points to understanding a condition and managing said condition while pursuing a worthwhile life.</p><h2>15. Stages of Grief</h2><p>Author Elisabeth Kubler-Ross outlined the five stages of grief in her book On Death and Dying, published in 1969. Since the introduction of the grief stages, psychologists and the bereaved have tried to achieve the perfect realization of each stage. The theory boxes the act of grieving into a nice, compact cycle. However, this leads the bereaved to experience distress based on their actual grieving process. The NIH assures individuals that no cycle of grief or bereavement is correct or incorrect.</p><figure><img title="15. Stages of Grief" src="IMG/BB1kDsaS_15_stages_of_grief.jpg" alt="15.

The Gen X cohort, those born between 1965 and 1980, definitely left their mark on the culture of the time. However, like all trends, some of this era have become outdated and should be reconsidered. Here are 18 Gen X trends that might have outlived their relevance.</p><p>18 Gen X Trends Whose Time Has Past</p><h2>18 Startling Life Lessons Threatening Our Kids’ Futures</h2><p>Raising kids is like building IKEA furniture without a manual: all those mysterious parts and no idea where they go.
