Rest one minute at the end of the round. 2-4 rounds total," Grace instructs.</p><p>–jump squat into triple-pulse squat.</p><p>–twist squat with knee lift.</p><p>–triple-pulse lunge into kick.</p><p>–cross cross squat.</p><p>–reverse lunge into plank.</p><p>–floor tap lunge into knee lift.</p><figure><img title="1 Here Is the Workout" src="IMG/BB1lMySc_1_here_is_the_workout.jpg" alt="1 Here Is the Workout"><figcaption><em>1 Here Is the Workout. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2 Do Pilates and Strength Training</h2><p>Grace encourages "a fusion of Pilates technique with traditional fitness," she told <em>Naluda</em>. "So we use dumbbells and resistance bands and do squats and curls. But always with the underlying philosophy of posture strength, elegant movement, and muscle lengthening." Why is pilates a good workout? According to the Mayo Clinic there are lots of benefits to the workout, as it "strengthens the body's inner core while increasing its flexibility resulting in improved overall health." It can also promote longer, leaner muscles, injury prevention, relief from stress and back pain, enhanced athletic performance, and heightened mind-body awareness. And, the Mayo Clinic explains that strength and weight training help reduce body fat, preserve and increase lean muscle mass, and burn calories more efficiently. Strength training may also help you:</p><p>–Develop strong bones</p><p>–Manage your weight</p><p>–Enhance your quality of life</p><p>–Manage chronic conditions</p><p>–Sharpen your thinking skills</p><figure><img title="2 Do Pilates and Strength Training" src="IMG/BB1lMEVD_2_do_pilates_and_strength_training.jpg" alt="2 Do Pilates and Strength Training"><figcaption><em>2 Do Pilates and Strength Training. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3 Stick to Workouts You Love</h2><p>What is the absolute best workout, according to Grace? One you will actually do. She recommends trying "a lot of different formats and you'll find the one you love enough to stay motivated and keep going," she told <em>Naluda</em>. "It might be something social and structured (and free) — like a running community training for a 10k that has each weekly jog planned out to the exact mile and meets at the same time every week. Or something flexible like joining a fancy studio that offers different modalities and allows you to toggle between yoga and boot camp. Keep experimenting and you'll hit upon the fitness routine that matches your vibe and gets you coming back."</p><figure><img title="3 Stick to Workouts You Love" src="IMG/BB1lMMfc_3_stick_to_workouts_you_love.jpg" alt="3 Stick to Workouts You Love"><figcaption><em>3 Stick to Workouts You Love. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4 Snack on Protein and Fiber</h2><p>Grace snacks, but keeps it healthy. "There are several bags of frozen edamame in my freezer at all times. It's incredibly high in both protein and fiber. It's quick and easy to fry or bake with a splash of olive oil, salt and pepper. You can also change the taste of it with any type of marinade or seasoning mix, so it never gets old," she told <em>Naluda</em>.</p><figure><img title="4 Snack on Protein and Fiber" src="IMG/BB1lMySv_4_snack_on_protein_and_fiber.jpg" alt="4 Snack on Protein and Fiber"><figcaption><em>4 Snack on Protein and Fiber. © Provided by Body Network</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5 Get Your Steps In</h2><p>Grace also recommends getting your steps in. How many should you aim for if you want to lose weight? According to a 2018 study published in the journal <em>Obesity,</em> walking 10,000 steps a day was linked to weight loss and weight management.
