The business was hard and relentless work, but I loved it. Before all that, my adult life focused on building my career as a lawyer and raising a family. Now, our youngest child of four was finishing school. The child-raising was done, and my business was sold. Suddenly, it felt like I had nothing left.</p><p>With the rest of our lives before us, my husband and I wondered who we were without our kids or careers.</p><h2><strong>I worried about what my husband and I would do with our new free time</strong></h2><p>I was lost. For the first time in my life, I had no purpose or direction. I had oodles of time to do whatever I wanted, but I didn't know what that was.</p><p>My husband and I agreed that we should sell the business; we did not agree on early retirement.</p><p>"We are too young to retire," I told him repeatedly. "We still have so much to offer."</p><p>"Don't be crazy. We should grab the opportunity of a new, slower life with both hands," he often answered.</p><p>Our marriage has been a long and happy one. I wasn't concerned about spending a lot of time with my husband, but I was concerned about spending <em>all </em>our time together. Leading up to retirement, I wondered: What would we do, what would we talk about, and would we get sick of each other?</p><p>The questions boggled my mind during the first few weeks of early retirement as I started cleaning out the cupboards — begrudgingly. The task was so boring and mind-numbing that I worried the task was a representation of the rest of my life.</p><p>Out of force of habit, I compulsively checked my emails countless times a day only to be continually disappointed when I saw shopping emails imploring me to buy the latest whatever.</p><h2><strong>Eventually, I noticed a change in myself</strong></h2><p>Day by day, week by week, I felt myself growing lighter. The furrow between my eyes faded. I didn't realize how often I had screwed my face in concentration trying to solve the latest problem. I didn't realize the extent of the weight I had been carrying on my shoulders — the weight of a team of 35 people and thousands of clients. The weight of the bushfire that I imagined was out there flickering, always threatening to flare up and damage the business, finally dissipated.</p><p>I started filling my days with things other than work and the 100+ emails that needed answering every day.</p><p>I met up with neglected friends and kept surprising myself as I told them I would fit in with <em>their</em> week. I no longer had to see when I could squeeze in a coffee date. I no longer had to take my laptop with me to the hairdresser or send emails while I was grocery shopping.</p><p>On our usual morning walk with our fur baby Golden Retrievers, my husband and I were able to slow down. The walks became longer and less hurried. We often finished with a leisurely coffee at a café.</p><p>Plus, we started traveling more and for longer periods.</p><p>Sure, I'm spending more time with my husband, but our time together now is more meaningful. And it's giving me a reason to find the new me.</p><h2><strong>I'm trying to write a new chapter for myself</strong></h2><p>As I explored who I wanted to become outside my career and outside my marriage, I decided I should start to write. I've signed up for a few online writing courses. I have started experimenting with flash fiction, short stories, memoirs, poetry, and travel writing.</p><p>Eighteen months into retirement, I can see that this period of my life is a gift. I can stop rushing, and I can start nourishing myself with things that I want to do. I have the luxury of time and the freedom to do what I want when I want. I can be present and not preoccupied.</p><p>Early retirement has gifted me the opportunity, quite literally, to write another chapter of my life — and this chapter is all about me.</p><p>If you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.</p></main>
