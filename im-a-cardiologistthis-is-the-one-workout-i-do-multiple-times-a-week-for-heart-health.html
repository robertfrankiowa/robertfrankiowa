Provided by Parade</em></figcaption></figure><p>It’s no secret that exercise is important for keeping your heart healthy. The American Heart Association recommends engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate to vigorous exercise each week and lifting weights at least twice a week. Scientific research shows that living a sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol—neither of which is good for your heart.</p><p>There are a wide range of ways to get your heart pumping and it’s important to choose an exercise you enjoy; otherwise, you won’t do it regularly. But it can also be helpful to see examples of heart-healthy workouts to serve as inspiration. With that in mind, we asked a cardiologist what their go-to workout was. Keep reading to check it out.</p><h2>A Cardiologist’s Go-To Workout for Heart Health</h2><p>Vascular cardiologist <strong>Dr. Rohit Vuppuluri, DO, </strong>says that when it comes to exercise, he values workouts that are quick and efficient. Because of this, he says his go-to workout is an interval training exercise. </p><p>“One of the common exercises I perform is a treadmill exercise that incorporates intervals and increases intensity as the workout progresses. This workout can be adjusted to each person's speed and stamina,” he says. See exactly how to do it below:</p><p><strong>Warmup: </strong>Walk or jog for 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>Cycle 1: </strong>Run for 90 seconds, followed by a 30-second burst of running at 80% maximum speed. Recover by walking for one minute.</p><p><strong>Cycle 2: </strong>Run for 90 seconds, followed by a 30-second burst of running at 80% maximum speed. Recover by walking for one minute.</p><p><strong>Cycle 3:</strong> Run for 90 seconds, followed by a 30-second burst of running at 90% maximum speed. Recover by walking for one minute.</p><p><strong>Cycle 4: </strong>Run for 90 seconds, followed by a 30-second burst of running at 90% maximum speed. Recover by walking for one minute.</p><p><strong>Cycle 5:</strong> Run for 90 seconds, followed by a 30-second burst of running as fast as you can. Cool down with a 2-minute walk.</p><p>“This is a quick and efficient workout that can be done inside on a treadmill or outside. It only takes 30 minutes but will increase the heart rate and keep it elevated,” Dr. Vuppuluri says, explaining why he likes it. He adds that it’s an example of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise, which is good for increasing stamina and burning fat.</p><h2>The Best Way To Exercise for Heart Health</h2><p>If you don’t currently exercise and want to start doing so in a way that benefits your heart, Dr. Vuppuluri recommends talking to your doctor first. That way, you know what’s safe for you as an individual. Got the all-clear? “I recommend creating a routine that in the first two weeks consists of easy and quick exercises so that you only have to spend 30 minutes exercising. After two weeks, gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts,” Dr. Vuppuluri says as a next step. He adds that it can be helpful to follow a fitness plan either online or through a fitness trainer to help guide your exercise plan.</p><p>As you can tell from the above workout, Dr. Vuppuluri is personally into high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. “High-intensity interval training exercises improve cardiovascular fitness by improving cardiac function, lowering blood pressure and increasing insulin sensitivity,” he says. </p><p>Scientific research does show that doing HIIT workouts regularly supports heart health as well as protects against obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But if HIIT workouts aren’t for you, there are plenty of other types of exercise that scientific research shows benefit heart health, including running, swimming, cycling and pickleball.</p><p>“Exercising can be a daunting endeavor and often the thought itself is enough to dissuade anyone from starting. When first starting, start slow and take your time. Give yourself a few weeks to acclimate to your exercises and don't be afraid to take a few cheat days along the way!” Dr. Vuppuluri says. What’s most important is that you start. </p></main>
