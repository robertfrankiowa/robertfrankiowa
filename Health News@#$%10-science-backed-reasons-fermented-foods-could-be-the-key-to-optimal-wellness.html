Regular intake may help reduce the risk of infections and support overall immune function.</p><h2>3. Enhance Nutrient Absorption</h2><p>The fermentation process can increase the bioavailability of nutrients in foods (ref). For example, fermentation breaks down phytic acid in grains and legumes, making minerals like iron and zinc more easily absorbed by the body.</p><h2>4.

Some studies indicate that probiotic-rich foods may help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, highlighting the potential of the gut-brain axis.(ref)</p><h2>5.
