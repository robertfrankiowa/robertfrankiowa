    <main><h1>What Do Hip Dips (Violin Hips) Look Like, and Can You Get Rid of Them?</h1><p>     <strong>Medically reviewed by Amy Kwan, PT</strong><p>Popularized on social media, the term “hip dip” (or “hip dimples”) refers to a gap or divot on the outer portion of your hip just below your waist. This completely normal skin indentation, also known as “violin” or “hourglass” hips, has been unfairly called out by some influencers as being undesirable or unnatural.</p><p>This article will outline what hip dips are, explain why some people have them, and clear up whether exercises can reduce their appearance.  </p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/AA1mE1pL_person_measuring_hips.jpg" alt="person measuring hips"><figcaption><em>Photo by Alex Tihonov / Getty Images. Provided by Verywell Health</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Hip Dips Are Normal</h2><p>Before describing what a hip dip is, it is important to understand that this anatomical feature is extremely common and completely normal. People’s bodies come in many different shapes and sizes, and your curves are unique to you.</p><p>Many factors influence the shape of this region of the hip, including the size and width of your pelvic bones and the distribution of muscle and fat in the area. Because of this, having hip dips is natural.</p><p><h3>Who Gets Hip Dips? </h3><p>Any body type can have a hip dip, though people with higher or wider hips may be more likely.</p><p> <h3>Describing the Shape of Hip Dips</h3><p>A hip dip is an indentation in the skin on the outer portion of the thigh. It typically appears in the region above the hip bone (also known as the greater trochanter) and below the rim of your waist (called your iliac crest).</p><p>This gap is also known as violin hips because its appearance mimics the shape of this musical instrument.</p><p>  Learn More: 5 Hip-Strengthening Exercises for Runners </p><p>It is important to differentiate between this type of curve and so-called love handles, which occur when excess fat builds up in the waist area. Hip dips occur naturally in many people and are neither undesirable nor unhealthy.</p><p>Love handles may indicate that you have excess visceral fat in your abdomen. This finding has been shown to increase your</p><p>risk of chronic conditions like:</p><ul><li>Cardiovascular disease</li><li>Dementia</li><li>Asthma</li><li>Certain types of cancers</li></ul><h2>Why Do People Think They Need to Get Rid of Hip Dips? </h2><p>The advent of social media and constantly changing perceptions of the “ideal” body type have caused people to focus on common anatomical differences like hip dips.</p><p>In addition, many people confuse hip dips with love handles, which have long been identified as unhealthy by medical professionals and undesirable in popular culture. Whether right or wrong, this has led many in society (particularly young people and those on social media) to seek out ways to get rid of their hip dips.  </p><p><h3>Surgery for Hip Dips</h3><p>While unnecessary, some people opt for cosmetic surgery to alter the appearance of their hip dips. Most commonly, this procedure involves injecting fat taken from another part of the body into the indentation (known as liposculpting).</p><h2> Does Exercise Fill Out Hip Dips? </h2><p>The distribution of fat in your pelvis plays a role in whether or not you have hip dips. Because of this, many people claim that you can reduce fat and “fill in” your hip dimples with exercise.</p><p>While it is conceivable that fat-burning and muscle-strengthening exercises could help reduce the appearance of hip dips, exercise to hone in on a sole area of the body does not usually work. It is important to understand how your body responds to exercise.</p><p>  Learn More: How Does Wegovy (Semaglutide) Work? </p><p>Studies have consistently shown that it is not possible to spot tone a specific region of your body with fat-burning exercises. Instead, most experts give the following suggestions to those looking to obtain a healthier physique:</p><ul><li>Stick to a low-carbohydrate eating plan that is high in protein and fiber-rich foods.</li><li>Perform 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to intense cardiovascular exercises on most days.</li><li>Avoid highly processed foods.</li><li>Incorporate moderate strength training exercises into your workout regimen.</li></ul><h2>4 Exercises to Target Hips, Not Necessarily Dips</h2><p>While strengthening the hips will not necessarily reduce your hip dips, it may help improve the stability in your legs. It can also reduce your risk of sustaining a low back or knee injury.</p><p>To properly target this important area of the body, try the four exercises below.</p><h3>Side-Lying Hip Abduction</h3><p>This exercise uses a resistance band to target the gluteus medius muscle on the side of your hip:</p><ol><li>Lie on your side and secure a resistance band around both legs just above your knees.</li><li>Without allowing your trunk to roll backward, lift the top leg straight up in the air.</li><li>When you cannot raise the leg any higher without rocking your body backward, slowly lower it down again. Complete two to three sets of 10 repetitions.</li></ol><h3>Single-Leg Bridge</h3><p>This challenging exercise focuses on the gluteus minimus, a smaller stabilizing muscle located beneath the gluteus medius:</p><ol><li>Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the ground.</li><li>Lift one foot off the ground so the leg is held in the air.</li><li>Pushing through the other leg, lift your buttocks off the ground as high as you can while keeping your pelvis level.</li><li>Hold this position for a second or two before slowly lowering your butt to the ground. Repeat this exercise 10 times and try two to three sets.</li></ol><h3>Dead Lift</h3><p>This simple exercise activates the large gluteus maximus muscle</p><p>using only a kettlebell:</p><ol><li> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and a kettlebell on the floor in front of you.</li><li> Bend at the waist and reach down to grab the weight. Make sure not to round your spine as you do this.</li><li> Lift the kettlebell off the ground and return to an erect standing position. As you do this, squeeze your buttock muscles to engage them.</li><li> Reverse the motion and slowly lower the weight to the ground once again. Complete two to three sets of 10 dead lifts. When this is easy, increase the amount of weight you are using.</li></ol><p>Commonly thought of as an abdominal exercise, this activity also targets the gluteus medius muscle:</p><ol><li> Lie on your side with your knees straight and your forearm on the ground</li><li> Lift your bottom hip in the air while keeping your body in a straight line.</li><li> Hold this position for 10 seconds before lowering back down again. Try 10 repetitions at a time.</li></ol><h2>Summary</h2><p>Hip dips are a naturally occurring indentation on the side of your thigh beneath the waist. Despite what you may read on social media, this normal body curvature is neither bad nor unhealthy.</p><p>Focusing on maintaining a healthy diet, performing regular cardiovascular exercises, and completing a well-rounded hip strengthening regimen is the best way to achieve a healthy physique. </p>
