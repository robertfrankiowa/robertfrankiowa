    <main><h1>Experts Weigh In On The True Benefits Of Aloe Vera Juice</h1><h2>Better Digestion</h2><p>“Research shows that aloe vera helps support healthy digestion by stimulating the intestinal muscles to move properly,” says Heidi Moretti, MS, RDN, who writes the blog <em>The Healthy RD</em>. “It also helps to increase the water in the bowel, allowing for easier bowel movements.”</p><h2>Contains Antioxidants</h2><p>Moretti adds that aloe vera juice contains over 200 active compounds. "Aloe vera juice is rich in antioxidants that help support overall health, especially gut health," she writes. </p><p>The Cleveland Clinic agrees, emphasizing that aloe vera juice is complete with antioxidants that can help reduce the chances of developing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.</p><figure><img title="Contains Antioxidants" src="IMG/AA1iMBJY_contains_antioxidants.jpg" alt="Contains Antioxidants"><figcaption><em>Contains Antioxidants.

When you're dehydrated, the skin becomes dry and could lead to pores with more oil. Inadvertently, this leads to acne, breakouts, and clogged pores. However, if you stay hydrated with beverages like aloe juice, then you have a higher chance of being in the clear.</p><h2>Low in Calories</h2><p>Some juices are high in calories, but not aloe vera juice. Although this juice isn't a significant source of carbohydrates, fat, or protein, it's low in calories. According to the Cleveland Clinic, aloe vera juice has roughly eight calories for an eight-ounce glass. So go ahead and have two.</p><h2>Low in Sugar</h2><p>Naturally low in sugar, aloe vera juice couldn't be more special. Enjoy it on its own or add it to your favorite juice and go half and half. That way, you can still have a sweet fresh fruit flavor with all of the benefits. It is a win-win.</p><figure><img title="Low in Sugar" src="IMG/AA1iMzam_low_in_sugar.jpg" alt="Low in Sugar"><figcaption><em>Low in Sugar. carlosgaw - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Maintains Eye Health</h2><p>According to Cleveland Clinic, aloe vera juice is rich in antioxidants and beta carotene, which is found in orange and yellow fruits and vegetables. Think, carrots and sweet potatoes. The body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A and that's linked to your overall eye health. </p><figure><img title="Maintains Eye Health" src="IMG/AA1iMzar_maintains_eye_health.jpg" alt="Maintains Eye Health"><figcaption><em>Maintains Eye Health.

That means better bowel movements and reduced constipation, giving you even more reasons to sip on some aloe juice. </p><h2>Neutral Flavor</h2><p>Being low in sugar, aloe vera juice has a neutral flavor resulting in its refreshing taste. Add it to drinks or smoothies for a hint of freshness that won't overpower your beverage. Sip, sip, hooray!</p><figure><img title="Neutral Flavor" src="IMG/AA1iMJgi_neutral_flavor.jpg" alt="Neutral Flavor"><figcaption><em>Neutral Flavor. manusapon kasosod - Getty Images</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Some Vitamins and Minerals</h2><p>Aloe vera juice has vitamin C, which is known to help with immune health. It also contains healthy traces of calcium and magnesium, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p></main>
