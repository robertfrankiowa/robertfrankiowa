A 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 40% of Latine high schoolers felt sad or hopeless for two or more weeks—6 percentage points higher than in 2017. Additionally, suicide attempts among Latines have been on the rise for over a decade, and they are especially high among Latinas. But what’s going on—and what can parents do about it? </p><p>“Latinx youth have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation,” says Ryann Morgan, MA, LPC, owner of Harlie’s Haven. “The risk is increased if the Latinx youth is also queer, neurodivergent, first-generation immigrant or living with a first-generation immigrant family member, or are ‘different’ in one way or another.”</p><p>Feeling misunderstood by their families and as though “they don’t belong in either culture” is a common issue for first-generation Latinx tweens and teens,” adds Dulce Orozco, LMHC, founder of Latina Immigrant Therapist. The pressure of moving, added responsibilities like taking care of siblings, or always translating for their parents can add to unspoken “or very much spoken pressure to do well and excel because of all the sacrifices the parents made for them.”</p><p>Plus, “there is a lot of pressure to ‘fit in’ for immigrant teens, and even for second-generation individuals,” says Camila Pulgar, PhD, LMCHC, owner of Salud Mental Health. “The cultural crash is real and it can be hard to deal with when you don’t have the tools, or maybe grew up in a family where emotions are not talked about much.”</p><p>The pandemic, in particular, “exacerbated mental health challenges among young Hispanics,” says Marisol Solarte-Erlacher, MA, LPC, a trauma expert and speaker. “The increased economic challenges further compound this stress, as many Latinx families faced financial struggles that require teens to prematurely take on significant responsibilities at home, reducing their access to mental health resources and educational opportunities.”</p><p>But mental health challenges for Latine teens and tweens are unfortunately nothing new. We spoke with experts about the common stressors our children face, signs of mental health struggles parents should watch out for, and what—if anything—we can do to help our kids. It sounds scary, but there’s hope at the end of this road. </p><h2>Common Stressors Latine Teens and Tweens Face</h2><p>According to Morgan, some stressors for Latine tweens and teens include: </p><ul><li>Marginalization</li><li>Immigration issues such as separation or adaptation</li><li>Systemic racism and oppression</li><li>The stigma of getting help for mental health</li><li>Struggles with peer relationships</li><li>Familial conflict</li></ul><p>“Not every adolescent will experience these situations, but research indicated Latinx youth are more likely to experience these types of stressors, which directly impact their mental health,” they say.</p><p>“The pressure of acculturation can significantly impact mental health,” adds Luis Cornejo, LMFT, CST, owner of PsychoSocial Therapy. “Additionally, the stigma surrounding LGBTIQIA+ identities within some Latinx communities adds another layer of stress. This can include media coverage on LGBTQ+ issues, politics, bullying, and violence against the LGBTQ+ community.” </p><p>Challenges that arise due to “language barriers between teens and their parents or with teachers can lead to feelings of isolation and misunderstanding,” Cornejo adds. Plus, “socioeconomic challenges, such as financial instability and living in underserved communities, also contribute to the heightened stress experienced by Latinx youth.”</p><p>When it comes to “heightened stress and suicide attempt rates,” Solarte-Erlacher says, “Family expectations often place immense pressure on young Latinas to succeed academically, adhere to traditional roles, and maintain cultural customs, causing conflict when these expectations clash with the broader values of American society.”</p><h2>Signs of Mental Health Struggles Parents Should Watch For</h2><p>“Latinx parents should be vigilant for various signs of mental health struggles in their teens, which can manifest in multiple ways,” says Solarte-Erlacher. “Expressions of hopelessness, or worthlessness, or extreme mood swings are important warning signs. In younger children, increased instances of tantrums, nightmares, or regression in developmental achievements might indicate distress.”</p><p>Experts we spoke to agree that isolation, irritability, changes in grades, and problems with sleep (sleeping a lot or hardly at all) are signs of mental health struggles such as anxiety or depression.</p><p>Dr. Lisa Bendimez, LCP, founder of Holistic Psychological Services, says that “anxiety is more prevalent than depression,” and parents should additionally look out for excessive worry or changes in eating habits, such as restricting food or excessive eating.</p><p>However, Morgan says Latine adolescents are at higher risk for depression as well, and parents should watch for:</p><ul><li>Use of substances, such as alcohol or cannabis</li><li>Loss of interest in normal activities</li><li>Struggling to concentrate or focus</li><li>Physical illnesses, such as headaches or stomach problems</li></ul><p>“Some of the depression signs can also be signs of increased suicidal ideation, such as giving away their things, feelings of emptiness and/or hopelessness, mood swings, talking about wanting to die or not be around anymore, or reckless behavior,” adds Morgan.</p><p>Solarte-Erlacher says it’s crucial for Latine families to be aware of these signs and “understand the cultural context that may influence their teen’s mental health. It's important for parents to create a supportive environment that encourages open communication, ensuring teens feel safe discussing their feelings.”</p><h2>Addressing Worries About Your Teen’s Mental Health</h2><p>Orozco says Latine families face barriers to mental health care such as “not knowing when to get professional help and lack of access to culturally sensitive resources in a timely manner.” And with waitlists for mental health services being “incredibly long,” Orozco urges parents to “think about mental health in a preventative way.” She encourages parents to look for programs for Latine and Black teens, such as Chica Project and Love Your Magic in Massachusetts.</p><p>“Sometimes, schools and pediatricians can be allies and advocates in this process,” says Orozco. “Unfortunately, they don't always have culturally appropriate resources for the Latinx community, but it can be an option for parents.”</p><p>According to Morgan, you can address mental health concerns in early childhood through games, social stories, and play therapy with a licensed counselor. “As children get older, assisting with co-regulation, providing safe spaces to talk, and normalizing attending therapy can greatly impact the probability of an adolescent attending therapy or even asking for help,” says Morgan.</p><p>“Parents should seek professional help when signs of mental distress are observed,” says Solarte-Erlacher. “Engaging with culturally competent health providers who understand the specific needs and cultural background of Latinx individuals can greatly improve the effectiveness of treatment and support offered.”</p><p>Bendimez says that if cost or insurance is an issue, look for agencies that provide funding for undocumented individuals or low-income families. Additionally, parents who want to help their teens and tweens should:</p><ul><li>Be open to listening, even if it is difficult to hear your child is struggling</li><li>Discuss emotions in the home regularly, and teach them how to identify feelings by using tools like a wheel of emotions </li><li>Check-in with kids by discussing the highs and lows of the day at the dinner table</li><li>Make the conversation age-appropriate, but remember it’s never too early to start teaching kids about mental health, just like physical health</li></ul><p>“Leveraging the Hispanic tradition of storytelling, such as sharing 'cuentos' and 'dichos', can be a powerful way to engage teens,” adds Solarte-Erlacher. “Parents can share personal stories or family histories of overcoming difficulties, discuss cultural folklore to strengthen identity or read relevant books together. This approach not only fosters a connection and understanding but also provides a platform for discussing tough topics in a more accessible and relatable way.”</p><p>Sarah Oreck, MD, MS, a reproductive psychiatrist and co-founder and CEO of Mavida Health, says not to forget the abuelos in these conversations. “For grandparents and other family members who may be resistant to discussing mental health, educate them about the importance of mental health care using culturally relevant resources and emphasizing that mental health is as important as physical health,” says Oreck. “Encouraging family discussions and involving trusted community leaders or religious figures can also help bridge the gap in understanding. This change has to start with the parents.”</p><h2>How Parents Have Helped Their Teens and Tweens</h2><p>“I did not shy away from therapy,” says Christina M., a mom of two living in Los Angeles. “I have had anxiety myself as long as I can remember but didn’t get help until college. I noticed signs of anxiety in both children at an early age.” She recommends therapy and apps like Calm Kids because they’re a great way for kids to find coping mechanisms. </p><p>For Morgan, whose eldest struggles with anxiety, they have “worked on learning breathing techniques, having a safe space to say anything, and purchasing products for positive and helpful sensory experiences, such as headphones, earbuds, puffy, various fidget toys, and stuffed animals.” Most recently, they have studied Retrain Your Anxious Brain: Practical and Effective Tools to Conquer Anxiety in their homeschool curriculum.</p><p>They add, “When we go to public places or outings, such as the zoo, museums, or hockey games, my eldest will have one earbud in with music actively playing. This helps regulate their nervous system and provides a safe distraction while still being able to interact with the family.”</p><p>A client of Solarte-Erlacher, who spoke with us anonymously, says they “realized that the best thing that I could do for my child other than find them help with a therapist is to find help for myself. I needed to learn how to manage my own emotions so that I could help my child with theirs.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Oreck is already emphasizing to her toddlers the importance of naming their feelings from an early age. “For instance, when they feel like crying, I encourage them to let it out, even though many Latinx parents—including my own—might discourage boys from showing vulnerability or say something like ‘no llores.’ I tell them that it's OK to cry and that it's a natural way to deal with emotions. By helping them name their feelings and listening without judgment, I've noticed they feel more comfortable sharing their emotions. This approach helps break the stigma and teaches them that expressing their feelings is healthy and strong from an early age.”</p><p>And it’s not just parents who can help their kids. As an uncle, Cornejo prioritizes “open communication and ensures nieces and nephews know that their feelings are valid and important. I check in on them and let them know that I am here if they need me. I remind them that they are loved and when they do reach out, I listen twice as much as I speak. My hope is to create the kind of support and environment I needed growing up as a Latinx teen. I strive to be curious and supportive, rather than offering solutions or shaming.”</p><p>Most of all, Orozco reminds parents they don’t have to do this alone. </p><p>“My 8-year-old daughter has been having difficulty sleeping,” she explains. “After trying to talk to her about it, trying lavender oil, meditation, and EFT, I knew I did not have the resources to help her even though I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, so I reached out for help. First, I talked to her teacher about what was happening, and then we both reached out to the school counselor and asked for help. Luckily, this was worked out, and I did not need to find help outside the school, but I would have if I needed to. I understand I have the privilege of having all this information and looking for private help if required, but resources are available for everyone; we just need to find them.”</p><p>As for Christina, who is glad she recognized anxiety in her kids at an early age, she adds that parents should be aware that “what works for one kid doesn’t always work for both. Treating [them] as individuals is important!”</p><p>The following resources can be helpful for Latine teens and their families when seeking culturally competent care.</p><ul><li>Therapy for Latinx</li><li>Latinx Therapy</li><li>Inclusive Therapist</li><li>National Queer & Trans Therapists of Color Network</li><li>Teen Line</li><li>Mental Health America </li></ul>
