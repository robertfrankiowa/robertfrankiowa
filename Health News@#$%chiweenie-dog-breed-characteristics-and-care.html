Also known as choxies, this small dog breed has grown in popularity over the years and can have a variety of colors and coats making each one especially unique. Find out what kind of care Chiweenies need and if they're the right pet for you.</p><p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p><strong>Group: </strong>Designer</p><p><strong>Height: </strong>6-10 inches</p><p><strong>Weight: </strong>5-12 lbs</p><p><strong>Coat: </strong>Short, long, or wire-haired</p><p><strong>Coat Colors: </strong>Fawn, chocolate, black, white, blue, dapple, and combinations of these colors</p><p><strong>Life Span: </strong>12-16 years</p><p><strong>Temperament: </strong>Active, alert, brave, vocal</p><p><strong>Hypoallergenic: </strong>No</p><p><strong>Origin Country: </strong>USA</p><h2>Characteristics of the Chiweenie</h2><p>Chiweenies have a lot of personality in their little bodies. Both Chihuahuas and dachshunds are small and mighty breeds that are also great alarm dogs, and these qualities have been passed on to the Chiweenie. Chiweenies are very energetic but require some training and socialization to ensure they are polite members of the family. These dogs are brave, loyal, and make great family companions.</p><table>   <tr>       <td>       <b>Affection Level</b>       </td>       <td>      Medium       </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Friendliness</b>      </td>      <td>      Medium      </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Kid-Friendly</b>      </td>      <td>      Medium      </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Pet-Friendly</b>      </td>      <td>      Medium       </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Exercise Needs</b>      </td>      <td>      Medium       </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Playfulness</b>      </td>      <td>      High      </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>      <b> Energy Level</b>      </td>      <td>      High      </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Trainability</b>      </td>      <td>      Medium       </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Intelligence</b>      </td>      <td>      High      </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Tendency to Bark</b>      </td>      <td>      High       </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>       <b>Amount of Shedding</b>      </td>      <td>      Medium      </td>   </tr> </table><h2>History of the Chiweenie</h2><p>There isn't much known about the history of the Chiweenie, but it's speculated that the initial intent was to help prevent some of the back issues that are commonly experienced by dachshunds. Because this breed is such a young breed, it does not yet have a breed standard so the traits, temperament, and looks of this breed can vary widely. Because this is a hybrid dog breed, Chiweenies are not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).</p><h2>Chiweenie Care</h2><p>Chiweenies are pretty low-maintenance pets but like all dogs, they require exercise, basic grooming, and a good amount of training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Their short legs mean they aren't built for marathons, but Chiweenies still need exercise. A walk around the block, some playtime in the yard, or playing fetch with some toys inside for about 30 minutes a day is all this breed typically needs. Chiweenies also need mental stimulation, so puzzle toys, training sessions, and teaching new tricks can help prevent boredom.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Depending on the type of coats the parents have, Chiweenies can have short, long, or wire-haired coats, but short coats are the most commonly seen. Regular brushing, baths, nail trims, and ear cleanings, and teeth brushing is important to keep your Chiweenie happy and healthy.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Chiweenie can be a stubborn breed, attach themselves to one person in particular, and have jealous tendencies, so proper training and socialization is important. The earlier you start training, the better. In addition to obedience training and socialization, it's recommended to crate train your Chiweenie.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Mixed breeds are usually healthier than pure breeds, but Chiweenies are still prone to some health problems that Chihuahuas and dachshunds are predisposed to, including:</p><ul><li>Luxating patellas</li><li>Periodontal disease</li><li>Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD)</li><li>Ear infections</li><li>Parasites</li></ul><p>Yearly check-ups with your veterinarian can help keep your Chiweenie healthy and catch any underlying issues before they become a major problem. Once your dog is over the age of seven or eight, twice-yearly check-ups should commence since dogs age more quickly than humans.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all dogs, Chiweenies should eat a nutritionally complete diet formulated for dogs by veterinary nutritionists. Measure out the appropriate amount of food for your Chiweenie's size and specific needs to help prevent obesity and other health problems. If you aren't sure what your dog should be eating, ask your veterinarian for recommendations as some dogs will require specific diets if they have certain types of health concerns.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Chiweenie</h2><p>There are breeders that focus on Chiweenies in particular, but you should be cautious when purchasing a Chiweenie from just anyone. Be careful of breeders that only breed for profit, house their dogs in unsanitary conditions, or won't show you the parents. Responsible breeders should selectively breed their dogs to help prevent poor health qualities from being passed on to the offspring. Rescuing or adopting a Chiweenie may also be an option and in addition to all-breed rescues, some Chihuahua or dachshund-specific rescues may even have Chiweenies available, too.</p><h2>Chiweenie Overview</h2><h4>Pros</h4><ul>   <li><p>Chiweenies are an affectionate breed</p></li>   <li><p>Chiweenies form a strong bond with their owners</p></li>   <li><p>Chiweenies do not require hair cuts</p></li>  </ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul>   <li><p>Chiweenies can be very vocal dogs</p></li>   <li><p>Chiweenies can be a stubborn breed</p></li>   <li><p>Some Chiweenies can be prone to back, dental, and/or knee issues</p></li>  </ul><h2>More Dog Breeds and Further Research</h2><p>If you’re interested in similar breeds, check out:</p><ul><li>Miniature dachshund</li><li>Miniature Schnauzer</li><li>Pembroke Welsh corgi</li></ul><p>    <strong>What’s the difference between a Chihuahua and a Chiweenie?</strong>   </p><p>    <p>A Chihuahua is a purebred toy dog that originated in Mexico.
