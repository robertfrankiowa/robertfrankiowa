But aside from toned abs looking impressive, they're also great for your body, stabilizing your spine and supporting your entire body.</p><p>We asked a celebrity fitness trainer who has helped A-listers and pro athletes get in top shape to share his recommendations for the best abs workouts. </p><h2>The Top 3 Best Workouts for Visible Abs, According to a Celeb Trainer</h2><p><strong>Gunnar Peterson</strong>, celebrity fitness trainer and MitoQ spokesperson, first says his pick for a great ab workout is F45 Training, a system of functional training that mixes elements of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and circuit training. Peterson is now the Chief of Athletics at F45—but said he was instantly hooked when he first took a class as a participant. “I took the class a couple of years ago, and I chased them down and said, 'What you guys do for the masses is what I do for the individuals, and I want to be a part of it.'”</p><p>         <strong>View the original article to see embedded media.</strong>       </p><p>However, there are three specific moves that Peterson recommends for killer abs—this routine can help you get visible abs this summer. </p><h3>Weight plate rotations </h3><p>Weight plate rotations—where you sit on the floor and hold a weight plate in both hands with outstretched arms, moving it from one side of your body to the other – are also great for ab definition. "The weight plate rotations hit the obliques and the serratus, [which is] key to the finished look," Peterson says.</p><h3>Mountain climbers </h3><p>Mountain climbers are exercises in which you start from a push-up position and then alternatively bring one knee at a time up toward your chest. Peterson says, “The mountain climbers challenge the ab wall from its origin which is a final pinch to the pooch!” </p><p>A tornado ball is a medicine ball that’s usually attached to a rope. Add some intensity to your standard abs workout by swinging the ball back and forth above your head while doing sit-ups. Peterson posted a video on his Instagram feed of NFL player Randall Cobb doing “tornado balls” as part of an intense workout.</p><p>         <strong>View the original article to see embedded media.</strong>       </p><h2>Consistency Is Key</h2><p>With any kind of wellness or fitness action, the most important—and often most challenging—part is sticking with it. Peterson says it’s unrealistic to expect immediate results from a single workout, noting there's not one thing or a one-time event that will magically transform you into great shape. “One workout doesn't make you fit and one meal doesn't make you fat. The only thing that's going to work is being consistent. No matter what workout you choose, whatever you can do consistently is going to have a far greater yield than anything you do sporadically.”</p><p>         <strong>View the original article to see embedded media.</strong>       </p><h2>Lifting Weights Can Boost Your Metabolism All Day Long</h2><p>Peterson also strongly recommends adding some weights to your workout. “I'm not saying blow off cardio. But anytime you're lifting weights, you're moving and you're increasing lean mass—that’s active tissue—versus fat, which is inert tissue. That's ‘paying the bills’ in the off hours from the gym. You're burning fat at a higher rate even when you're not working out.” </p><p>This strategy is smart, Peterson says, because it boosts your metabolism and fat-burning processes long after your workout ends. “This is burning fat while asleep versus the people who do the elliptical and say, ‘I burned 400 calories, so I could have a muffin.’ You could, but that's not really the way to go. It's the people who are doing the deadlifts and the pull-ups and the presses and the lunges that are seeing their body is working overtime all the time, including the 23 hours of the day outside of the gym.”</p><p>         <strong>View the original article to see embedded media.</strong>       </p><h2>A Smart Diet and Good Supplements Also Help </h2><p>Don’t overlook the critical role that diet plays in ab development or overall fitness, Peterson says. “Your nutrition is key. Protein should be the first thing in your crosshairs.” He also recommends <strong>MitoQ</strong> for more energy and quicker post-workout recovery. “It's mitochondrial health, the powerhouse of your cell. It's like getting a strong foundation. It's like working from the ground floor up.” </p><p>         <strong>View the original article to see embedded media.</strong>       </p></main>
