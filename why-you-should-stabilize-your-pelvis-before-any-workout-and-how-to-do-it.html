But if you really want to keep good form and prevent an injury, physical therapists say you may want to add in a few pelvic stability exercises, too.</p><p> <p>Your pelvis might not be the first thing you think about when you're about to go on a run, play a sport or lift weights, but no matter what type of movement you're doing, having a stable pelvis matters. It connects your lower and upper body, and it's home to many important muscles, ligaments and connective tissues that affect the way your whole body moves and functions.</p><p> <p>Read on to find out how stabilizing your pelvis can help you make the most of your workouts, and exactly how to do it.</p><h2>Pelvic Stability and Exercise</h2><p> <p>"The pelvis is the center of the body and everything we do — every movement and every action — starts with force generated in the core and pelvis," says Lindsay Durand Massumi, PT, DPT, a doctor of physical therapy specializing in prenatal and pelvic health.</p><p> <p>"The pelvis is also responsible for weight transfer activities like rolling, moving from sitting to standing and walking," Massumi says. "When we lack enough stability in the pelvis, or the muscles surrounding the pelvis don't fire appropriately, it can affect the way we move and exercise."</p><p> <p>The muscles in and around our hips play a big role in how we move in each direction. Strengthening and mobilizing these muscle groups is important, especially if you exercise regularly.</p><p> <p>"Over 30 muscles attach to the pelvis, including our pelvic floor muscles, our core, our hip rotators, abductors, adductors, extensors and hip flexors," explains Judith Meer, PT, DPT, a doctor of physical therapy specializing in pelvic health.</p><p> <p>"And the hip controls our movement in three directional planes — the sagittal plane (forward and backward), the frontal plane (side-to-side), and the transverse plane (rotational movements)."</p><h2>Performance and Injury Risk</h2><p> <p>Because our pelvis influences how we move in each direction, pelvic stability exercises can help us move more comfortably and efficiently no matter what type of workout we're doing. On the flip side, a lack of stability can really hurt us.</p><p> <p>"When we don't stabilize the pelvis prior to exercise, we may not see the same improvements in strength, coordination or endurance," Massumi says. Over time, it may even lead to pain and injury.</p><p> <p>"Imagine it like a tug of war from multiple directions: Weakness, tightness, overuse or injury in one area will affect how the others are able to function," Meer says. "The extra stress on those muscles, joints and ligaments makes them more prone to strain and irritation. Things like nagging knee or back pain, pelvic dysfunction or poor posture, for example, can all stem from issues around pelvic stability."</p><h2>8 Exercises for Pelvic Stability</h2><p> <p>"Activating the muscles that support your pelvis, especially those that you will use for the exercise you're planning to do, is a great idea," Meer says.</p><p> <p>"If you're playing basketball, with its frequent side/cutting movements, exercises that work on warming up and mobilizing the front plane will be beneficial. If you're going for a jog, exercises for the sagittal plane are helpful. If you're playing golf or tennis, working on the rotational aspects to target the transverse plane are useful."</p><p> <p>Before your next workout, add a few of these PT recommended pelvic stability exercises to your routine. Pick at least three exercises and perform at least 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps (or, try them all!).</p><h2>1. Lateral Lunge</h2><p> <p>"Lateral movements like the side lunge work your balance, stability and strength and can be made more challenging by holding weights or increasing your speed," Meer says.</p><h2>2. Squats</h2><p> <p>"[Squats] are functional and can help with everyday activities like getting in and out of a chair or running after your kids," Meer says.</p><h2>3. Shin Box Get-Ups</h2><p> <p>Shin box get-ups work your hip flexors, tensor fasciae latae (thigh muscles involved in hip flexion, abduction and internal rotation), your glutes and adductors (inner thigh muscles).</p><h2>4. Bridges and Pelvic Tilts</h2><p> <p>Pelvic tilts and glute bridges both help with glute engagement and pelvic alignment. "These exercises are a good place to start if standing exercises are causing discomfort," Meer says.</p><h2>5. Clamshells</h2><p> <p>Doing the clamshell exercise correctly works your glutes and helps improve your hip flexor strength and core stability.</p><h2>6. Dead Bugs</h2><p> <p>Dead bugs make for a great core workout because not only do they engage the abdominal muscles, but they also recruit your pelvic floor and hip flexor muscles.</p><h2>7. Bird Dogs</h2><p> <p>The bird dog exercise strengthens your obliques, glutes, hamstrings and back and stabilizes the pelvis.</p><h2>8. Supine Marches</h2><p> <p>Supine marches work your core and pelvic floor and are an ideal prep for workouts that involve pelvic bracing.</p><h2>Important to Remember</h2><p> <p>Keep in mind that pelvic stability is important, but you don't have to be completely "even" on both sides of your hips to move efficiently.</p><p> <p>"Having a stable pelvis does not mean that we need to be perfectly level or evenly strong on both sides," Meer says. "We are all somewhat asymmetrical, whether that's in hip strength or limb length or foot size. As long as these differences are not causing pain or discomfort, there is no need to 'fix' them."</p><p> <p>If you are experiencing discomfort or pain in your pelvis during your workouts or certain types of movement, it may be a good idea to see a physical therapist.</p><p> <p>"A physical therapist can assess your hip stability, strength and alignment with a variety of tests to identify any issues, weaknesses or imbalances," Meer says. "They can help you develop an exercise plan that will shift you towards moving with confidence and ease again."</p></main>
