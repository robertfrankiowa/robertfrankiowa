    <main><h1>13 Ways to Relieve Itchy, Dry Eyes</h1><h2>Humidifiers</h2><p>If you struggle with dry eyes, dry environments are only going to make the problem worse. Using a humidifier will help keep your eyes hydrated by making sure there is a proper amount of moisture in the air.</p><figure><img title="Humidifiers" src="IMG/BB1llu0a_humidifiers.jpg" alt="Humidifiers"><figcaption><em>Humidifiers.

Eating a diet full of inflammation-fighting foods high in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids can help. These foods include salmon, tuna, walnuts, and eggs; omega-3 supplements can also be taken.</p><figure><img title="Omega-3 Fatty Acid" src="IMG/BB1llu0b_omega_3_fatty_acid.jpg" alt="Omega-3 Fatty Acid"><figcaption><em>Omega-3 Fatty Acid.

If you struggle with itchy eyes, make sure you remove all potential allergens from your life. Regularly vacuuming, dusting, and generally cleaning your house will help prevent allergens from aggravating your eyes. </p><figure><img title="Keep Allergens Out of Your Home" src="IMG/BB1lln0r_keep_allergens_out_of_your_home.jpg" alt="Keep Allergens Out of Your Home"><figcaption><em>Keep Allergens Out of Your Home.

Because contacts are pressed up against your eyes, they can easily aggravate your eyes. You shouldn’t be scared to make the switch to glasses, though; they’re cool now!</p><h2>A Warm Compress</h2><p>Using a warm compress or rag does a lot for people with eye problems. If the glands in your eyes aren’t producing enough oil, a warm compress will help. This will prevent your eyes from drying out, encourage circulation, and relax your eyes.</p><h2>Stay Hydrated</h2><p>It’s important for everybody to stay hydrated, but even more so for people who struggle with excessively dry eyes. The more moisture your body has, the more tears you can produce. Being hydrated will make sure your body can take care of your eyes. </p><h2>Blink More</h2><p>If you’re reading, watching TV, or staring at your phone, you’re probably not blinking enough. Whenever you do these tasks, try to make a conscious effort to blink. This will keep your eyes hydrated by preventing them from being exposed to the air for too long.</p><h2>The 20-20-20 Rule</h2><p>No matter your age, profession, or habits, you should be following the 20-20-20 rule, especially if you’ve been staring at a screen all day. Every 20 minutes, you should look at something 20 feet away for about 20 seconds. This will provide the much-needed relief your eyes have been craving.</p><h2>Use A Cold Compress</h2><p>If you feel like your dry eye problems come from staring at a computer or straining while reading for long stretches of time, you might find relief in a cold compress. Cold compresses relieve eye strain while encouraging circulation.</p><figure><img title="Use A Cold Compress" src="IMG/BB1llrps_use_a_cold_compress.jpg" alt="Use A Cold Compress"><figcaption><em>Use A Cold Compress.

If possible, avoid going outside on windy days. If you have to be outside during windy weather, we recommend wearing wraparound sunglasses.</p><h2>Avoid Extreme Temperatures</h2><p>Extreme temperatures can intensify your dry eye problems more than you’d expect. Both extreme heat and extreme cold can sap the moisture from your eyes. If you’re experiencing some uncomfortable or crazy weather, it might be a good idea to stay indoors.</p><h2>Be Careful with Your Hairdryer</h2><p>There are numerous things in your home that could be causing dry, itchy eyes. Fans and hairdryers are especially problematic. They can often blow dry air at your eyes for extended periods of time causing your eyes to dry out. Do everything you can to avoid blowing air at your eyes.</p></main>
