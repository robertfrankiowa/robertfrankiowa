    <main><h1>Does Walking With a Weighted Vest Offer Health Benefits?</h1><p>Walking is a popular form of exercise and a great way to improve your health. As an easily accessible activity that requires no equipment, walking decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia, improves mental well-being, and increases longevity. </p><p>Wearing a weighted vest while walking can add a challenge and some of the benefits of strength training to a walking routine.</p><p>In this article, you will learn the benefits of wearing a weighted vest while walking, whether it can help with weight loss, the disadvantages of wearing a weighted vest, who should avoid using it, and how to choose the correct vest and incorporate it into your walking routine.</p><figure><img title="Provided by Verywell Health" src="IMG/BB1pT4qa_a_group_of_four_people_walking_on_a_path_in_a_city.jpg" alt="A group of four people walking on a path in a city"><figcaption><em>Hinterhaus Productions / Getty Images.

These muscles include those that move your ankles, knees, and hips, such as:</p><ul><li>Calf muscles (soleus and gastrocnemius)</li><li>Gluteal muscles (buttocks)</li><li>Hamstrings (back of thigh)</li></ul><p>The muscles of the back and core that support posture during walking, such as the erector spinae (a string of muscles that run alongside your spine) and abdominal muscles, must also work harder while wearing a weighted vest.</p><h2>Weighted Vest Benefits</h2><p>There are many benefits to walking with a weighted vest.</p><h3>Increases Workload</h3><p>For people who are limited to low-impact activities such as walking, adding a weighted vest is a great way to vary the activity and add challenges.</p><h3>Helps Build Bone Density</h3><p>The extra weight from a vest puts more stress on the bones, helping to build bone density. For people who are walking to lose weight, a weighted vest can help mitigate the loss of bone mass that occurs with weight loss, especially in those over 65. </p><h3>Burns More Calories</h3><p>A weighted vest increases the amount of energy spent while walking. The extra weight increases the heart and respiration rates during exercise. The muscles must also work harder, increasing metabolism (energy expenditure).</p><h3>Improves Balance</h3><p>Walking with a weighted vest improves balance by strengthening the muscles around the hips, core, and legs. Wearing the vest itself also challenges balance, which can help.</p><h3>Builds Muscle</h3><p>Adding weight training exercises to physical activity can build muscle and increase your metabolic rate. Walking with a weighted vest adds weight to the exercise, thus increasing lean body mass and improving leg strength.</p><h3>Improves Cardio</h3><p>Wearing a weighted vest increases the aerobic intensity of walking—elevating the heart rate and increasing oxygen consumption. These two factors improve cardiovascular endurance over time.</p><h3>Boosts Balance and Agility</h3><p>A study of young soccer players showed that warming up with a weighted vest improved agility. The athletes were better prepared to keep up with the demands of a soccer game, which includes sprinting and repeatedly changing direction while running. </p><h3>Improves Core Strength</h3><p>Walking uses the muscles of the core—the abdominal and spinal muscles. Adding extra weight to the activity improves core strength.</p><h2>Does Walking With a Weighted Vest Help You Lose Weight?</h2><p>To lose weight, you must increase your daily physical activity, decrease your calorie consumption, or combine both. Walking with a weighted vest can help you lose weight by challenging your body. A weighted vest intensifies your workout, increasing your heart rate and burning more calories.</p><p>Over time, walking regularly with a weighted vest can improve lean mass, adding muscle to the body. Muscle mass increases metabolism, which can help you burn more calories while at rest and lose more weight.  </p><h2>Disadvantages of Walking With a Weighted Vest</h2><p>Though there are many benefits of walking with a weighted vest, there are disadvantages to consider as well.</p><h3>Risk of Injury</h3><p>Adding weight to any activity can increase the risk of injury. Overdoing the weight or the amount of time you spend walking while wearing the vest can strain the joints and muscles, which can lead to injury.</p><p>Some people have also reported that wearing a weighted vest can cause lower back pain or soreness.</p><h3>May Create Posture Problems</h3><p>Wearing a weighted vest may cause posture problems. The extra weight distributed on your shoulders and back may cause you to unconsciously compensate for the extra weight by arching your back or leaning your head forward, which can change your posture. </p><h3>Creates a Limited Range of Motion</h3><p>For some people, wearing a weighted vest might limit their range of motion. Certain vests are more rigid, making it difficult to take full walking strides with proper arm swinging.</p><p>In some cases, a weight vest can also limit chest expansion when breathing. For some people, a lack of strength can also make it harder to maintain a full range of motion while wearing a weighted vest.</p><p>Weighted vests add another layer of clothing, and the weight itself does not allow for much breathability in the fabric. Wearing a vest in the summer heat may not be comfortable.</p><h2>Who Should Avoid Using Weighted Vests? </h2><p>Some people should avoid using weighted vests. If you are wondering if a weighted vest is right for you, talk to a healthcare provider. In general, people with certain conditions should avoid wearing weighted vests. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>People with neck or back injuries</strong>: The spine and neck are intimately connected, and placing extra strain on one can affect the other. If you have a neck or back injury such as degenerative disc disease, the added weight from the vest may aggravate your condition.</li><li><strong>People with injuries or chronic pain</strong>: Though building strength and endurance can help prevent injuries and lessen chronic pain, for some people, a weighted vest may put too much strain on the muscles, joints, and bones, leading to more pain or injury.</li><li><strong>Pregnant people</strong>: The vest itself may not be comfortable for a growing belly, and the added strain from the weight may not be healthy for a pregnant person.</li></ul><h2>What to Look for in a Weighted Vest</h2><p>When looking for a vest, there are various factors to consider, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Comfort</strong>: You want a vest that you can wear throughout your walk. When trying on the vest, make sure it doesn't pinch anywhere. Look for areas that might rub against the skin and cause a blister. Consider whether a vest that goes over or under clothes is best for you.</li><li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: Consider the difficulty of putting on and removing the vest. You want a vest that you can easily incorporate into your daily walking routine without much effort.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: Some vests have a set weight. Others have removable weights, so you can increase and decrease the vest's weight depending on your ability and the desired challenge. Find a vest that works with your fitness level.</li><li><strong>Hindrance to walking</strong>: You want a vest that will not impede your walking ability. One that is too big might make it difficult to swing your arms in a proper walking stance.</li></ul><h2>How to Incorporate a Weighted Vest in Your Walking Routine</h2><p>Before you use a weighted vest, ensure you have developed good walking posture and technique. You want to walk upright, not bent forward or sitting back on your hips.</p><p>You may want to check with a personal trainer or knowledgeable friend to ensure your walking posture is good both when walking without the vest and when walking with the vest.</p><p>When adding a weighted vest to your walking routine, start slowly. At first, you may only be able to walk for five to 10 minutes with the vest. Over time, try increasing the amount of time you spend wearing the vest and the distance you go while wearing it.</p><p>As you get used to wearing the vest, you can increase the time you spend walking with it and even vary the terrain, such as walking up a hill.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Adding a weighted vest to your walking routine has many benefits. A weighted vest works the leg, ankle, and core muscles.</p><p>A vest can also build bone density, increase muscle mass, burn more calories than walking alone, and improve balance and core strength. A weighted vest can also help you lose weight.</p><p>Though walking while wearing a weighted vest has many benefits, it also has disadvantages. These include a higher risk of injury, posture problems, limited range of motion, and discomfort while walking in higher temperatures. People with injuries or chronic pain and pregnant people should avoid wearing a weighted vest while walking.</p><p>When choosing a weighted vest, look for one that’s comfortable, easy to put on and take off, and the appropriate weight. When beginning a walking routine with a weighted vest, start slowly and build up the amount of time and distance you cover.</p></main>
