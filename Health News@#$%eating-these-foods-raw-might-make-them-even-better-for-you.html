    <main><h1>Eating These Foods Raw Might Make Them Even Better For You</h1><p>Eating some foods raw can actually be a game-changer for your health. Skipping the stove can boost the nutritional value of what you eat. Raw foods often pack more vitamins, minerals and enzymes than their cooked counterparts. Plus, they have a fresh and vibrant taste that’s hard to beat. Skip the heat with these foods and reap the rewards!</p><h2>Watercress</h2><p>Watercress is a powerhouse of nutrients, best enjoyed raw to maximize its vitamin C and antioxidants, which can be reduced by cooking. It adds a peppery kick to salads and sandwiches. Make sure to wash it well first as it tends to be full of dirt and sand.</p><figure><img title="Watercress" src="IMG/BB1kGMuA_watercress.jpg" alt="Watercress"><figcaption><em>Watercress.

Eating them raw preserves their high vitamin C and antioxidants helping to ward off free radicals, slash the risk of chronic conditions, and boost your overall health game. The magic lies in their phytochemicals, like flavonoids and anthocyanins, which thrive without the touch of heat. </p><h2>Leafy Greens</h2><p>Raw leafy greens provide maximum vitamin K, folate, and iron, essential for blood health and energy. The cooking process can diminish some of these vital nutrients, making raw consumption a more beneficial option. They’re great in salads or green smoothies. But, if you have a sensitive stomach, start slow, as raw greens can be hard to digest for some.</p><h2>Broccoli</h2><p>Eating broccoli raw preserves the sulforaphane, a compound great for heart health and digestion. It’s crunchy, perfect for dips or slaw. But, it can cause gas or bloating for some, so moderation is key. If you prefer your broccoli cooked, here’s a hack — add some ground mustard seed to it which will reactivate the enzymes that were destroyed during the cooking process. This works for other cruciferous vegetables too.</p><h2>Beets</h2><p>Raw beets maintain their fiber, folate, and betalains, promoting digestion and reducing inflammation. Grate them into salads or smoothies. Just be mindful, as they can stain everything they touch.</p><h2>Onions</h2><p>Raw onions keep their quercetin and sulfur compounds, supporting heart health and reducing inflammation. They add a sharp bite to salads and burgers. Just be aware, they can leave a strong aftertaste and might not be great for those with sensitive stomachs.</p><h2>Garlic</h2><p>Garlic eaten raw can maximize its allicin, beneficial for heart health and immune support. It’s potent, so a little goes a long way in dressings or dips. But, it can be harsh on the digestive system and cause bad breath, so maybe not before a date.</p><h2>Peppers</h2><p>Raw peppers are full of vitamin C and antioxidants which are more abundant when eaten raw. They’re crunchy, sweet, or spicy, perfect for snacking or adding a pop of color to dishes. Capsaicin, in hot peppers, can irritate, so be mindful depending on how sensitive you are.</p><h2>Cucumbers</h2><p>Enjoying cucumbers in their raw form is both refreshing and beneficial, thanks to their excellent hydrating abilities. They are a great source of vitamin K, necessary for blood clotting and bone health, while also providing essential minerals with minimal caloric intake. The cucumber skin, rich in fiber and vitamin A, supports eye health and enhances immune function. Incorporate raw cucumbers into salads, sandwiches, or as a snack with dips.</p><h2>Pineapple</h2><p>Pineapple is richer in vitamin C and bromelain when raw, aiding digestion and inflammation. It’s sweet, tangy, and perfect on its own or in fruit salads. However, the bromelain can tenderize your mouth, so don’t overdo it.</p><figure><img title="Pineapple" src="IMG/BB1kH0Td_pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple"><figcaption><em>Pineapple.

They’re crunchy and portable for an easy snack. Just wash them well to avoid pesticide residues or preferably, buy organic.</p><figure><img title="Apples" src="IMG/BB1kpbHn_apples.jpg" alt="Apples"><figcaption><em>Apples.

It’s sweet and perfect for tropical salads or smoothies. Just make sure it’s ripe to avoid potential irritants. </p><h2>Radishes</h2><p>Radishes offer more vitamin C and crunch when raw, great for a spicy kick in salads or as a snack. They can be a bit peppery, so start small if you’re not used to the bite.</p><figure><img title="Radishes" src="IMG/BB1kCPi6_radishes.jpg" alt="Radishes"><figcaption><em>Radishes.

It’s sweet, tangy, and perfect for adding to fruit salads or eating on its own. Just be cautious if you have a latex allergy, as some cross-reactivity can occur. Many don’t realize but kiwi skin is also edible, especially the golden varieties which aren’t as fuzzy as the classic green kiwi.</p><h2>Pears</h2><p>Pears are more fibrous and hydrating when eaten raw, supporting digestion and providing vitamins. They’re sweet and crunchy, great on their own or in salads. Just be sure to eat them ripe for the best flavor and digestibility.</p><h2>13 Reasons Why You Should Grow Your Own Food (Even Just A Little!)</h2><p>Growing your own food isn’t just for those with sprawling gardens; a small container or patch of dirt is all you need to start.
