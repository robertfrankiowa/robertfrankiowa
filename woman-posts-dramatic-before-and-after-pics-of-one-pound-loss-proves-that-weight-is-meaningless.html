    <meta name="description" content="Every day, thousands of people flock to the gym to trudge grudgingly on a treadmill or other cardio machine for a predetermined amount of time. When we’ve become sufficiently sweaty, we head to the bathroom scale and hold our breath - willing the tiny needle to stop going up, up, up.

    <main><h1>Woman Posts Dramatic Before-And-After Pics of One Pound Loss – Proves That Weight Is Meaningless</h1><h2>Why Does Muscle Weight More Than Fat?</h2><p>Muscle and fat are both types of tissue, but they have different tissue densities. While fat has a density of about 0.9g/ml, muscle has a density of 1.06g/ml. All this means is that if you had a pound of fat and a pound of muscle, the fat would take up more space, because it’s not as “tightly packed” or dense as muscle tissue.</p><p>When we start making changes in our diet and exercise habits, we go through body re-composition, not just weight “loss”. While we burn fat, we’re also building up muscle- both processes are important. Here are <strong>5 Health Benefits of Strength Training</strong>.</p><figure><img title="Why Does Muscle Weight More Than Fat?" src="IMG/BB1nOqhY_why_does_muscle_weight_more_than_fat.jpg" alt="Why Does Muscle Weight More Than Fat?"><figcaption><em>Why Does Muscle Weight More Than Fat?.

A faster metabolism means your body will convert the calories you eat into energy faster - storing less excess calories as fat. (1) (2)</p><h2>2/5 Benefits of Strength Training: Prevents Diabetes</h2><p>When you are lifting weights you are building muscle. That muscle has a much higher need for glucose than fat does, so it will scavenge it from your bloodstream. This lowers your blood sugar levels, which aids in the prevention and control of diabetes. (4) (5)(6)</p><h2>3/5 Benefits of Strength Training: Improves Bone Density</h2><p>Lifting weights puts stress on your bones just as it does on your muscles…but a good kind of stress! In the same way that ‘stressing’ your muscles makes them stronger, so does stressing your bones. Having stronger bones decreases your chance of developing osteoporosis, a degenerative bone disorder that occurs as you age, as well as protects against breaks and fractures from both chronic and acute damaging impact. (7)(8)</p><h2>4/5 Benefits of Strength Training: Increases Coordination and Mobility</h2><p>Weightlifting creates more muscle-to-brain connections, teaching controlled and coordinated movements. It also helps to maintain flexibility in your joints and ligaments. Maintaining a full range of motion is important in allowing you to easily do the everyday activities you need and want to, like making your bed, picking up your children or grandchildren, even just bending over to tie your shoe.

It also helps ward off Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass associated with aging. This is a huge factor in stability, balance, and fall prevention in the elderly. (9)(10)(11)</p><p>As Adrienne has proven, the scale does not tell the whole story when it comes to weight loss and body satisfaction. Instead of focusing on the numbers, we need to switch our focus to getting stronger and healthier. Strength training will not only help you to lose weight and feel amazing, it will also teach you to love your body for what it can do, not just what it looks like. Here are <strong>Tips to Break Your Unhealthy Relationship with the Scale!</strong></p><figure><img title="5/5 Benefits of Strength Training: Improves Longevity and Aging" src="IMG/BB1nOH4Y_55_benefits_of_strength_training_improves_longevity_and_aging.jpg" alt="5/5 Benefits of Strength Training: Improves Longevity and Aging"><figcaption><em>5/5 Benefits of Strength Training: Improves Longevity and Aging.

Stick to that one time, and don’t step foot on the scale the rest of the week! Weighing yourself too frequently cultivates an unhealthy obsession with what the scale says.</p><h2>Recognize Your Weight Changes ALL the Time</h2><p>Between the time of day, whether you’ve just had a meal, or even where you are in your menstrual cycle, your weight fluctuates quite a bit all the time. You can lose or gain 5 pounds within just 24 hours! Your body is a complex machine- understanding its healthy cycles can help take the scale stress away.</p><figure><img title="Recognize Your Weight Changes ALL the Time" src="IMG/BB1nOxw3_recognize_your_weight_changes_all_the_time.jpg" alt="Recognize Your Weight Changes ALL the Time"><figcaption><em>Recognize Your Weight Changes ALL the Time.

It doesn’t have to be about the numbers at all!</p></main>
