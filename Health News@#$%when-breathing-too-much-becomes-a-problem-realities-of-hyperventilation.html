    <main><h1>When Breathing Too Much Becomes a Problem: Realities of Hyperventilation</h1><p>Breathing is a crucial process where carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged. Our bodies need to maintain a specific pH concentration to breathe healthily. This gas exchange is necessary for daily life. Hyperventilation, common in younger women, has no known exact cause and clear diagnostic criteria. Let’s learn about the causes and ways to treat hyperventilation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Hyperventilation?</h2><p>Hyperventilation is a condition characterized by rapid and excessive breathing. During hyperventilation, the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood drops. The normal carbon dioxide concentration in arterial blood is 37-43mmHg, but with hyperventilation, it can drop to 35mmHg.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the Physical Causes of Hyperventilation?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pyjVr_when_breathing_too_much_becomes_a_problem_realities_of_hyperventilation.jpg" alt="When Breathing Too Much Becomes a Problem: Realities of Hyperventilation"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hyperventilation occurs with excessive breathing. As the lungs are responsible for breathing, hyperventilation happens when the lungs can’t function normally. Heart diseases can also cause hyperventilation since the heart plays a huge role in breathing.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Causes Hyperventilation Syndrome?</h2><p>Hyperventilation can often be psychological. When you are anxious or under excessive stress, you may experience hyperventilation. There are plenty of cases where the cause of hyperventilation is stress. Hyperventilation due to stress was first observed in soldiers. Extreme psychological pressures such as anxiety cause excessive breathing. These symptoms can create a vicious cycle, causing anxiety and worsening hyperventilation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the Symptoms of Hyperventilation?</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1py3KF_when_breathing_too_much_becomes_a_problem_realities_of_hyperventilation.jpg" alt="When Breathing Too Much Becomes a Problem: Realities of Hyperventilation"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>When hyperventilation happens, the carbon dioxide concentration decreases, leading to a decrease in breathing. Physical symptoms such as trembling, muscle fatigue, and dizziness due to electrolyte imbalance may occur. This can also affect the brain, causing severe consequences.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">TWO Ways to Treat Hyperventilation </h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Breathing Into a Paper Bag</strong></h3><p>One popular method of treating hyperventilation is breathing into a paper bag or mask. This method involves breathing continuously in a bag. The patient inhales the carbon dioxide in the bag, increasing the carbon dioxide concentration, normalizing pH, and treating hyperventilation caused by respiratory alkalosis. However, when performing this method, the bag should not be too close to the mouth to prevent suffocation.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Managing Stress</strong></h3><p>If someone is experiencing hyperventilation, you should calmly explain the current situation to the patient, stabilize them, and make them aware that the symptoms will ease if they control their breathing. In addition, remove sources of anxiety and, if necessary, administer anti-anxiety medication. If you often experience stress, try a hobby that allows you to control your mind and healthily relieve stress.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Caffeine Can Also Cause Hyperventilation</h2><p>Caffeine is known for stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, which worsens hyperventilation. Caffeine causes heart palpitations and can lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the heart. If oxygen is not adequately supplied, the carbon dioxide levels are also lower. Therefore, you should look out for caffeine to prevent hyperventilation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Postnasal Drip and Sinusitis Can Also Be Causes</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pyhAB_when_breathing_too_much_becomes_a_problem_realities_of_hyperventilation.jpg" alt="When Breathing Too Much Becomes a Problem: Realities of Hyperventilation"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hyperventilation can also appear from postnasal drip caused by rhinitis or sinusitis. However, if you have severe allergic rhinitis or asthma, you may experience difficulty breathing. Hyperventilation may happen during temporary excessive breathing associated with the trachea or lungs.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mainly Occurs in Young Women?</h2><p>Hyperventilation is relatively common among younger women and is evident in the entertainment industry. For example, a female actress was transported to the hospital during the broadcast due to hyperventilation. A photo of Blackpink’s Jennie struggling with hyperventilation was also posted.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breathing Through the Nose</h2><figure><img title="Provided by ViewusGlobal" src="IMG/BB1pyjWc_when_breathing_too_much_becomes_a_problem_realities_of_hyperventilation.jpg" alt="When Breathing Too Much Becomes a Problem: Realities of Hyperventilation"><figcaption><em>. Provided by ViewusGlobal</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you breathe with your mouth, more oxygen can be supplied, leading to hyperventilation. If you hyperventilate with your mouth, you should consciously try to breathe with your nose. Breathing with your mouth often dries out your mouth and negatively impacts your oral health.</p></main>
