    <main><h1>Brain Boosts: Keep Your Mind Sharp as You Age</h1><p><strong>Experts agree that staying active is an important part of maintaining the best possible health in your golden years. Find out why brain health is just as important and how you can promote it.</strong></p><h2>Physical Health Milestones</h2><p>You’ve probably heard about how you can keep your body healthy as you age. Walking, swimming, and other forms of low-impact cardio workouts are often touted as the gold standard for seniors who want to keep their bodies moving.</p><h2>The Importance of Brain Health</h2><p>But what about your brain? Studies show that brain health is as important to your overall well-being as any other organ, especially as you move into retirement. </p><h2>Keeping the Brain Active</h2><p>While most people hope to enjoy their retirement in a relaxing environment far from the stressors of work, there are benefits to keeping your brain busy.</p><h2>The Benefits of Exercising the Brain</h2><p>Much like how exercising muscles keeps them strong, using your brain helps maintain its critical functions like memory and problem-solving. Issues tend to arise when we stop exercising those functions.</p><h2>Brain-Stimulating Activities</h2><p>That’s why experts recommend brain-stimulating activities to help keep your mind in tip-top shape. Puzzles, books, consuming educational content, and even solving math problems can all make a big difference in brain health.</p><h2>Chemical Reactions</h2><p>Evidence suggests that completing a puzzle helps your brain produce dopamine, which makes you happy. Puzzles also keep your brain functioning and can even prevent memory loss.</p><h2>Puzzle Games and Their Benefits</h2><p>Puzzle games, many of which can be found via your smartphone or tablet, exercise your prefrontal cortex. This part of your brain is important for maintaining good cognition and mental alertness.</p><h2>Skill-Building for Brain Health</h2><p>Learning a new skill is another excellent way to sharpen your mind and exercise your brain. There are chemical processes that take place during skill-building that have long-term effects on brain health.</p><h2>The Dopamine Effect</h2><p>Like with puzzles, learning a skill releases dopamine, making you feel happier and content. Many people find joy in learning new skills as they age, such as fishing, knitting, or painting.</p><h2>Building Strong Connections</h2><p>Also, when you learn something new and repeat it, you bolster the connections in your brain. This will make new things feel even easier the more you try them.</p><h2>Forming Pathways</h2><p>The stimulation of neurons that takes place when you learn a new skill forms new pathways in the brain. When you learn something new, the structure of your brain is altered as a result.</p><h2>Why Your Social Life Matters</h2><p>Social interactions have a positive impact on brain health, as well. You may have moved to a new state or country to enjoy your retirement, but that doesn’t mean you should spend all your time alone.</p><h2>Don’t Be a Homebody</h2><p>Getting involved with groups of fellow retirees can be a great way to maintain a social life with people who understand you. Many communities have events or groups specifically for retirees to join.</p><h2>Keep It Moving – Your Brain, That Is</h2><p>The worst thing you can do for brain health is to let your brain be stagnant. If social events or new activities aren’t for you, consider other ways to stimulate your brain to prevent deficits from forming.</p><h2>Other Ways to Promote Brain Health</h2><p>Experts recommend getting plenty of sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising to the best of your ability. You don’t have to run a marathon to stay active!</p><h2>What Are Brain Games?</h2><p>Brain games, like Sudoku, crossword puzzles, Scrabble, and even Candy Crush, can keep you sharp while you relax. These games can be played on your phone while you kick back at the beach, and they can be played alone or with friends.</p><h2>The Magic of Brain Games</h2><p>Research has shown that with regular repetition, brain games improve cognitive ability, short-term memory, and overall mental agility. </p><figure><img title="The Magic of Brain Games" src="IMG/BB1lY0xi_the_magic_of_brain_games.jpg" alt="The Magic of Brain Games"><figcaption><em>The Magic of Brain Games.

That’s why it’s so important to stay on top of your brain health as early as possible.</p><h2>Toxic Talk: 21 Phrases to Never Say to Your Kids</h2><p>Are you worried about the impact of your words on your child’s well-being?
