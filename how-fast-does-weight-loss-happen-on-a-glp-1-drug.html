    <main><h1>How Fast Does Weight Loss Happen on a GLP-1 Drug?</h1><p>If you and your doctor have decided it’s right for you to take a weight loss medication — often referred to as a GLP-1 drug — you may be wondering what to expect.</p><p>For some people, weight loss can happen fast on these medications, which are prescribed under brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy (which are semaglutide drugs, also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists) or Mounjaro and Zepbound (which are tirzepatide drugs, known as dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists).</p><p>While a faster route to weight loss may be welcome news, that effect could come with a key disadvantage. “Rapid weight loss is not the goal, in my opinion. For me, the goal is sustainable, healthy weight loss,” says Caissa Troutman, MD, founder of WEIGHT reMDy in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Read on to learn the typical weight loss timeline on GLP-1 drugs, and how to ensure you’re well positioned to lose and maintain weight in a healthy, sustainable way if you are on these medications. </p><h2>How GLP-1 Drugs Cause Weight Loss</h2><p>Semaglutide and tirzepatide both belong to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), which mimic the GLP-1 hormone in the body that helps control insulin, blood-glucose levels, and satiety.</p><p>The first way GLP-1 drugs act is on receptors in the hypothalamus, which results in a decreased desire to eat, says Laura Davisson, MD, a professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine and director of the Medical Weight Management Clinic at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. “People have less hunger and fewer cravings, and say they no longer have as much ‘food noise’ when they are on these medicines,” says Dr. Davisson.</p><p>The second place where the medications work is in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract — also known as the gut. “The medicines slow down food movement through the GI tract, which makes people feel full longer as an additional method of helping with weight loss,” Davisson says.</p><p>Tirzepatide is a newer-generation weight loss drug that also acts on the GIP hormone to help with conditions including type 2 diabetes and obesity. A study of 1,879 patients with type 2 diabetes and a body mass index (BMI) over 25 found that participants on tirzepatide lost about 4 to 12 pounds more body weight at the end of nine months than those on semaglutide. A slightly higher percentage of those on tirzepatide reported adverse side effects compared to semaglutide patients (nausea, 17 to 22 percent compared to 18 percent; diarrhea, 13 to 16 percent compared to 12 percent; and vomiting, 6 to 10 percent compared to 8 percent).</p><h2>Is There a Typical Weight Loss Timeline on a GLP-1 Drug?</h2><p>“We historically have recommended that 10 percent weight loss over six months is a reasonable target for medical weight loss, but some people are losing weight faster on the GLP-1 medications,” says Davisson. These people are what some doctors call hyper-responders, she adds. That said, the pace of weight loss varies quite a bit from one person to the next.</p><p>One study followed 1,961 participants who were overweight or had obesity but not diabetes over 68 weeks. The participants, who started from an average weight of 230 pounds with obesity (a BMI of 38), had average weight loss of 14.9 percent (or 34 pounds) when taking a once-weekly 2.4-milligram (mg) injection of semaglutide. In comparison, the placebo group had a 2.4 percent weight loss (5 pounds) at the end of the same time period.</p><p>Furthermore, one-third of the study’s participants who took the weekly semaglutide lost at least 20 percent (an average of 46 pounds) of their body weight by the end of 15 months. The study notes that all participants made healthy lifestyle changes in addition to taking the semaglutide.</p><p>In another study, 2,539 adults who did not have diabetes and were overweight or had obesity (participants either had a BMI of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-related complication) took tirzepatide once per week for 72 weeks, at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg. At the end of the study, participants who took 5 mg of tirzepatide each week lost approximately 15 percent of their body weight, 19.5 percent when they took 10 mg doses, and 20.9 percent when on 15 mg doses. Meanwhile, the placebo group lost a little over 3 percent of their body weight.</p><h2>The Problem With Losing Weight Too Quickly on a GLP-1</h2><p>Due to their decreased appetite, slower digestion, and gastrointestinal side effects, people on a GLP-1 drug may find they feel full after eating only half to three-quarters of what they used to eat, says Dr. Troutman, and “for some patients, [a GLP-1 drug] can really curb their appetite, which can create a very low caloric intake. This needs to be monitored as we do not want excessive weight loss, which can create excessive muscle loss” and other possible problems.</p><p>Although all weight loss includes some loss of muscle, losing weight rapidly makes it particularly challenging to maintain muscle mass. A doctor may decrease the GLP-1 dose if weight loss is happening too quickly, which is dependent on each person. And in more extreme cases when a person isn’t getting adequate calories or is missing key nutrients in their diet, researchers say that may lead to both muscle loss (sarcopenia) and malnutrition.</p><p>“We take many factors into consideration when choosing a medication dose, including rate of weight loss. We also consider side effects, body composition including lean body mass, adequacy of nutritional intake, and lab results,” says Davisson.</p><p>Curbing muscle loss will involve incorporating high-protein foods into your diet as well as resistance exercises into your daily routine. The amount of protein you will need depends on your weight, says Troutman. But as long as kidney function is normal, she suggests her patients on a GLP-1 aim to eat 100 g of protein a day, with 60 g of protein as the minimum.</p><p>Some high-protein foods that can help you get to this 100 g of protein include lentils, fish, and lean meats like chicken breast, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Protein sources that offer fiber, including whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils, are smart choices. Fiber has many benefits, including helping resolve constipation, an issue some users on weight loss medications experience.</p><p>Some other warning signs that weight loss is happening too rapidly include gallbladder stone formation, hair loss, and fatigue, says Troutman. The doctor sees rapid weight loss as a red flag, indicating that the patient might not be consuming enough calories.</p><p>“It’s not just about losing weight quickly; it’s <em>how </em>did [my patients] lose weight?” she says. “I tell my patients that how they eat to lose weight is ideally how they will eat to maintain their weight long term. It has to be sustainable. So if they are not eating — which creates a significant caloric deficit for weight loss — that’s not ideal.”</p><h2>What Else to Know About Taking a Weight Loss Medication</h2><p>Beyond understanding what healthy weight loss on a GLP-1 looks like, here’s what else you should know as you dive into your treatment regimen.</p><h3>1. Weight Loss May Not Happen Immediately</h3><p>GLP-1 medications require slow-dose titration, says Davisson. It takes at least six months for someone to get to the maximum dose of Zepbound, for example, and longer for those who have more side effects. Some people may have successful weight loss before reaching the highest dose, while others may not see results until reaching the highest dose. If weight loss slows down, a doctor may increase the dosage.</p><p>“Weight loss is different in each person and is rarely predictable,” says Davisson. “Once someone is at the highest dose in six months, they typically continue to lose [weight] for the rest of the year and maybe beyond that, but there are always exceptions to the rule.”</p><h3>2. You May Experience Side Effects</h3><p>GLP-1 medication impacts the gut, so common side effects include nausea, vomiting, worsening acid reflux, diarrhea or constipation, and stomach discomfort or cramping.</p><p>“These symptoms may temporarily increase with dose increases, but later improve. In my experience, patients who continue to have such symptoms beyond a couple of weeks will not stay on the medicine. It would be rare for someone to continue the medicine if they are experiencing enough vomiting and diarrhea to lose excessive amounts of weight,” says Davisson.</p><p>It is important to talk with your doctor about these potential side effects and what to do if they arise during the treatment. It is also important to call your doctor if an adverse health condition pops up that might not be one of the typical side effects.</p><h3>3. You’ll Need to Plan for Weight Maintenance, Too</h3><p>Once you have reached your goal weight, Troutman advises talking with your doctor about what your long-term weight maintenance plan will look like.</p><p>“Our bodies are wired to regain the weight we have lost, as frustrating as that is, so we will need some medication to help prevent weight gain,” says Troutman. “For some patients, they need to stay on the same dose and regimen. For other patients, we can lower the dose or space out the dosing. It is very patient-dependent.”</p><p>Troutman emphasizes that communication with your medical provider is key in determining the best course of action for you, as well as having a backup plan in case significant weight regain happens.</p><p>Even if you stay on a GLP-1 medication indefinitely, weight regain is possible, says Davisson. “This is because the human body defends against weight loss. Essentially, if someone loses weight, physiological factors [such as hunger] will drive weight regain. This is why long-term weight loss [can be] difficult to achieve.”</p><p>One key tool for maintaining weight loss is physical activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all adults strive to do 150 minutes or more each week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus two muscle strengthening activities. The CDC further reports that people who maintain weight loss “typically engage in 60 to 90 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days,” which can be broken up in smaller amounts (like taking a brisk walk three times a day). </p><p>It is important not to think of your GLP-1 therapy as a quick fix that you will stop once reaching your goal weight. Rather, it will likely become a long-term tool — in addition to a nutritious diet, adequate exercise, and proper hydration — for weight management.</p><p>“We now know obesity is a chronic medical condition. As such, taking medication short term for what is considered a chronic issue is not the best plan,” says Troutman.</p><p>Troutman suggests thinking of weight loss treatment similarly to other chronic issues, such as high blood pressure. Can you take a blood pressure medicine for a few months and then stop? Not usually — it will just go back up again, she says. The same goes for weight and obesity.</p><p>Davisson agrees that using GLP-1 medications is best as a long-term treatment, but also acknowledges that this field of research continues to evolve. “The general philosophy is to treat obesity as a chronic disease with indefinite use of GLP-1 medications. That being said, we do not have many years of using these medications for obesity treatment. Some people will stop using them for various reasons, and that will give us an opportunity to study what happens. Maybe we will learn that some weight loss can be maintained if habits change significantly or if there are options for maintenance with other medications.”</p><h2>The Wrap-Up</h2><p>The speed of weight loss that occurs on a GLP-1 medication is largely dependent on the individual. A reasonable weight loss rate is typically losing 10 percent of your body weight over the course of six months. It’s best to talk to your doctor about what a healthy weight loss timeline will look like for you, and to make sure you are eating enough, especially high-protein foods, while on a GLP-1 medication to support healthy weight loss without risking your health and well-being.</p><p>Editorial Resources and Fact-Checking</p></main>
