    <main><h1>Find your inner Olympic athlete with our 31-day workout plan</h1><p>When you think “athlete,” images of Olympians conquering impressive physcial feats may come to mind. But the truth is, we are all athletes in our own right! Whether you love to play pickleball, spend time picking up and carrying your kids or grandkids, or walk your dog, these are all athletic movements that require strength, balance and cardiovascular health.</p><p>That's why this month, we're using the Olympics as inspiration to find our own inner athlete <em>— </em>whatever that looks like for you! Whether your goal is better performance during a hobby or sport, or you simply want to move with more ease and less aches and pains during your daily routine, these atheletic movements will help you get there.</p><p>We'll also be getting inspiration from the workout routines of our TODAY co-hosts. We all know that Al Roker loves to walk, so we’ve got lors of functional movements to help you walk (and run!) with more ease and better posture. Dylan Dreyer’s into her golf game, so we’ve got rotational exercises to help improve a golf and tennis swing. Sheinelle Jones is our runner, so we’ve got some exercises to improve power and core strength. Finally, Craig Melvin’s background in sports like basketball helped inspire some of the lower-body exercises that are essential for basketball players, cyclists and everyday athletes who’re looking to build muscle and improve balance and stability.</p><h2>31-day find your inner athlete challenge</h2><p><strong>>></strong><strong><em>Download a printable calendar</em></strong></p><p>This month’s workout routines are focused on functional exercises. We will be doing push, pull, hinging, squatting and rotational movements inspired by Olympic sports and the athletic endeavors of our co-hosts, plus other functional movements that prepare us to move with ease through everyday activities, preventing pain and injury. To give our bodies a break from the challenging routines, we will be using walking as an active rest day activity to keep us moving while releasing tension and easing any soreness.</p><h2>Meal plans to fuel your workouts</h2><p>This month, we're not only exercising like an athlete, but eating like one, too! Our Start TODAY dietitian designed weekly meal plans to help you get the most out of your workouts this month. Get your first weekly meal plan here!</p><h2>Full-body strength and mobility workout: Routine 1 </h2><h3>Inchworm</h3><p>Start with your feet hip-width apart and arms at your sides. Hinge at your hips and lean forward until your hands are touching the floor keeping a slight bend in the knee. Walk your hands forward, one at a time, until you are in a high-plank position. Your hands should be directly under your shoulders. Hold this position for a couple of seconds to engage the core and then slowly walk your feet toward your hands, keeping your legs straight. When your feet reach your hands, return to a standing position. Repeat for 10 reps.</p><h3>Hammer curl</h3><p>Hold one weight in each hand with your arms by your sides. Rotate the weights so that your palms face in toward your body. Then, curl the weight up toward the shoulder as if you’re trying to tap the end of the dumbbells onto the shoulders. Keep the elbows hugged in toward your side as you do this movement, and then lower the weights back down to your sides. Repeat 10 times.</p><h3>Single leg deadlift</h3><p>Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Put your weight into your left leg and come up on to your right toe, using it as a kickstand for balance. Begin to hinge at your waist, keeping your left knee soft. Place your hands on your hips or at the center of your chest for balance. Continue to hinge forward as you slowly lift your right leg up and back until your body forms a straight line from head to toe. Ensure that your hips stay square to the ground. Pause for a second and then return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times, and then switch sides.</p><h3>Russian twist</h3><p>Sit on the floor with your knees bent in front of you and your feet resting on the floor. (For a more advanced move, lift your feet slightly off the mat.) Keeping your torso and lower body still, begin slowly rotating side to side. Reach your hands toward the floor on the right, before moving through center and reaching them toward the floor on the left. Repeat 10 times to each side. </p><h3>Goblet squat</h3><p>Stand with your feet wider than the hips with your toes facing slightly outward. Bring your palms together at your chest with your elbows bent. Squeeze your abs and look forward as you push your hips backward and bend your knees. Remember to keep your back straight as you continue to lower your butt until your hips are below your knees. Position your elbows so that they are inside your knees before pushing down through the heels to stand back up. Repeat for 10 reps.</p><h3>Skaters</h3><p>Start standing tall with your feet hips-width apart. Then, as you step or hop to the right, step the left foot behind and to the right of the right foot, tapping it lightly on the floor. Begin to swoosh your arms like an ice skater to build momentum and help with balance. Then step to the left and bring the right foot behind you to tap the floor as you swoosh your arms. Repeat 10 times to each side.</p><h3>High knees</h3><p>March in place by bringing one knee up toward your chest to hip height and then placing it back on the ground before bringing the opposite leg up to hip height. For a more challenging modification, pick up the pace and add a bounce to the move so you are running in place while still driving the knees up to hip height.</p><h3>Wall sit</h3><p>Used to build endurance in the glutes, quadriceps and calves, the wall sit is another great knee-strengthening exercise. In an open space on a clear wall, sit back against the wall and slide down into a squat until you form a 90-degree angle with your hips and knees. Keeping your back flat against the wall, hold this position for 10 seconds. Complete three wall sits total.</p><h3>Bear crawls</h3><p>Begin on all fours with your hands directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Your back should be flat and your core engaged. Lift your knees slightly off the ground, about 1-2 inches. Your weight should be supported by your hands and toes. Simultaneously move your right hand and left foot forward a short distance. Next, move your left hand and right foot forward. Be sure to maintain control of your movements. Continue alternating your hands and feet, moving forward for 10 seconds.</p><h3>Tuck jump</h3><p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your knees slightly bent and your arms at your sides. Lower into a quarter squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back slightly. Swing your arms back to gather momentum. Explosively jump straight up as high as you can. As you jump, bring your knees up towards your chest. At the top of your jump, your thighs should be parallel to the ground, and your knees should be close to your chest. As you come down, extend your legs as you prepare to land softly by landing on the balls of your feet and keeping knees bent. Perform 10 reps.</p><h2><strong>Full-body strength and mobility workout: Routine 2</strong> </h2><h3>Chest press</h3><p>Lying on your back, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Open the arms out into a goal-post position, bending the elbows at 90 degrees. Exhale as you press the weights up, touching the weights directly over your chest with the arms extended. Then bring the arms back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 reps.</p><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1p4dyP_find_your_inner_olympic_athlete_with_our_31_day_workout_plan.jpg" alt="Find your inner Olympic athlete with our 31-day workout plan"><figcaption><em>. </em></figcaption></figure><h3>Bent over row</h3><p>Start standing with your feet hip-width apart. Hinge forward at your waist so that your torso is on a diagonal and pull your abs in. Let the weights dangle down by. Then, hug your elbows in toward your sides and pull the weights up toward your chest. Tighten your upper back and the area in between your shoulder blades. Then, lower the arms down keeping the elbows hugging in toward your sides. Repeat 10 times. </p><h3>Good mornings</h3><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1p4dyS_find_your_inner_olympic_athlete_with_our_31_day_workout_plan.jpg" alt="Find your inner Olympic athlete with our 31-day workout plan"><figcaption><em>. </em></figcaption></figure><h3>Bicycle crunch</h3><p>Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground hips-width apart. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows bent out to the sides. Then, use your abs to lift your left shoulder blade off the ground. At the same time, bring your right knee to meet your left elbow. When your right knee is bent, straighten your left leg and reach it out in front of you at a 45-degree angle. Move through the center to perform the crunch on the opposite side, bringing your left knee to your right elbow and straightening the right leg. Brush your inner thighs together as you switch sides to ensure you’re hugging your legs in toward the midline of the body. Continue alternating legs, performing 10 reps to each side. </p><h3>Jump squat</h3><p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Perform a regular squat, bending at the knees and sitting back into a squat position. Then, push off your toes and jump up explosively. Bring your arms up straight into the air as your feet lift from the ground. Try to keep a controlled movement, landing softly and in control before exploding into the air again. Perform 10 repetitions. </p><h3>Curtsy lunge</h3><p>Stand tall with your feet as wide as your shoulders. Step your right foot back behind your and slightly past your left foot. Bend both knees as you lower down into a lunge in this curtsy position. Then press down through your left heel to bring your right leg back to center. Step your left foot back behind and slightly past your right foot. Press down through your right heel to bring your right leg back to center. Continue alternative, performing 10 reps to each side. </p><h3>Broad jumps</h3><p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend at the knees, extending your arms behind your torso. Bring your hips back and bend your knees to sit back into a half squat. Then, shift your weight onto the balls of your feet so that your heels are lifted off the ground. Explode into the air, pushing off the toes, and swing your arms forward and straight up above your head. Jump as high and as far forward as you can. Land lightly on the ground with bent knees in a deep-squat position to lessen the impact. Walk back to your starting point and repeat for 10 reps.</p><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1p4g27_find_your_inner_olympic_athlete_with_our_31_day_workout_plan.jpg" alt="Find your inner Olympic athlete with our 31-day workout plan"><figcaption><em>. </em></figcaption></figure><h3>Superman</h3><p>Lie on your stomach and reach the arms forward and legs back. Open the legs as wide as the hips and the arms as wide as the shoulders. Pull the belly button in, away from the ground, to engage the abs. Relax the shoulders as you reach the arms up off the ground and squeeze the quads as you lift the legs off the ground. Avoid putting too much pressure on the low back by ensuring that the abdominals stay contracted. Hold for a second before lowering your limbs back to the ground. Repeat for 10 reps.</p><h3>Dumbbell jab</h3><p>Holding one dumbbell in each hand, stand with your feet as wide as your hips. Bend your elbows to hold the dumbbells close to your chest. Face your palms toward one another. Push one of the dumbbells forward and straighten your arm like you are throwing a punch in boxing, then bring it back to the starting position and repeat with the other arm. Repeat for 10 reps to each side.</p><figure><img title="" src="IMG/BB1p4ioi_find_your_inner_olympic_athlete_with_our_31_day_workout_plan.jpg" alt="Find your inner Olympic athlete with our 31-day workout plan"><figcaption><em>. </em></figcaption></figure><p>Begin in high plank (or forearm plank) position with your hands directly under your shoulders, keeping your core tight and back flat. Brinf your right knee toward your right elbow. Return your foot back to the starting position and repeat with the left leg. Continue alternating for 10 reaps to each side.</p></main>
