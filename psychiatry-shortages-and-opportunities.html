Provided by Health eCareers</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re beginning a career in psychiatry, you’ve got good reasons to be optimistic. Americans’ awareness of the importance of mental health has never been greater, and options for providing high-quality care to those struggling with mental illness continue to expand.</p><p>However, this dynamic field is also facing a great challenge: a growing workforce shortage, including a shortage of psychiatrists.</p><p>The Health Resources and Services Administration predicts that if current demand continues unchanged, we’ll have a shortage of 39,550 adult psychiatrists and 9,190 child and adolescent psychiatrists by 2030.</p><p>Learn more about what this shortage means for your psychiatry career.</p><h2>New Pressures in Supply and Demand</h2><p>As with other physician specialties, alarms about the shortage of psychiatrists have rung for many years. And in the last five years, several factors have collided to highlight the current psychiatrist shortage many parts of the country already face and shortages to come. Those factors include: </p><p><b>Aging psychiatrists outpacing new trainees.</b> The current psychiatry workforce is older than most other specialties with 60 percent in their mid-fifties. As these psychiatrists retire, it’s predicted that the supply of psychiatrists will decrease 20 percent by 2030, even as the demand for their services continues to increase.</p><p>Meanwhile,psychiatry residency and fellowship programs continue to lag in terms of training positions. Many institutions are adding residency and fellowship programs, but the number of slots that have been created has not yet matched the already expanding gap in the workforce. </p><p><b>The rise of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics.</b> In 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services expanded the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model nationally. These clinics offer a range of mental health and substance use services for everyone, regardless of insurance status. </p><p>While the new program brings much-needed care to more people, it also increases the need for a trained workforce to provide that care.</p><p><b>COVID-19.</b> Social isolation, the death of loved ones , financial worries, and other stressors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed the need for mental health services to unprecedented levels since 2020. </p><ul> <li>In 2019, about 20 percent of US adults reported having a mental illness. </li> <li>In 2021, nearly 40 percent of adults were reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression. </li> <li>In 2023, that number dropped to 30 percent, which was still significantly higher than prepandemic levels.</li> </ul><p><b>Ongoing shortages in rural areas.</b> As of 2024, more than 168 million people—almost half of the United States population—live in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas (HPSA), meaning that they lack enough mental health providers. Some 65 percent of rural communities don’t have any local psychiatrists. </p><h2>Financial and Human Costs</h2><p>Without access to trained psychiatrists and mental health specialists, people struggling with mental illness experience delays in treatment, which contributes to poor recovery outcomes. </p><p>The effects of untreated mental illness ripple throughout communities, with real human costs. </p><ul> <li>Although every year 1 in 5 US children has a mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder, only half of these children and adolescents receive the treatment they need.</li> <li>In rural areas, the suicide rate is between 18.3 and 20.5 per 100,000 residents, almost double the rate of urban communities. </li> <li>In 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages ten to fourteen and twenty to thirty-four.</li> <li>One in 4 people who die in officer-involved shootings are in a mental health crisis.</li> <li>Nearly two million people with mental illness, including many veterans with PTSD or other mental health conditions, are booked into jails each year, mostly for nonviolent, minor offenses.</li> </ul><p>Untreated mental illness strains community resources in terms of law enforcement, homeless shelters, and emergency medical services. The economy suffers too:</p><h2>Expanding Need, Expanding Opportunity</h2><p>The burdens our communities face from a too-small psychiatry workforce are troubling, but it’s not all bad news. </p><p>The demand for skilled psychiatrists also means you’ll have burgeoning opportunities for psychiatry career advancement and specialization. You can help address the shortage of mental health professionals and make a real difference in people’s lives.</p><p>Psychiatrists of all kinds are needed, but some subspecialties are particularly in demand. According to research by the Behavioral Health Workforce Research Center at the University of Michigan, three psychiatrist subspecialties are most in demand:</p><ul> <li>Child and adolescent psychiatry</li> <li>Geriatric psychiatry</li> <li>Addiction psychiatry</li> </ul><p>Psychiatrists who subspecialize in these areas, as well as those who are willing to work in a designated HSPA, will have many options to choose from.</p><p>The career opportunities in psychiatry can be wide-ranging, and regardless of your subspecialty, you’ll likely have opportunities to tailor your career to your preferences in terms of:</p><ul> <li>Practice setting, whether that’s emergency room, psychiatric hospital, private practice, or academic institution</li> <li>Patient population, from older adults to people with substance use disorders, adolescents, or veterans</li> <li>Acuity level, from mild to moderate mental health conditions to severe and persistent mental illness</li> <li>Work-life balance, including paid time off, workplace culture, and flexibility</li> </ul><p>Current medical students and residents may have more options for training than their predecessors did. Many universities and hospitals are increasing the number of residency and fellowship training programs and positions. </p><p>These programs also have started incorporating telepsychiatry and other treatment innovations into their training curriculum, meaning that future psychiatrists will have more tools for reaching more patients.</p><p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in mental health-related occupations and industries has grown over the past decade, and strong growth is projected to continue through 2032. Employment of psychiatrists is expected to grow by 7 percent from 2022 to 2032, substantially higher than other physician specialties. </p><p>Given the strong demand for psychiatrists in many subspecialties, you have many ways to design a career that fits your interests, meets your financial and work-life goals, and provides a much-needed service to your community. </p></main>
